![Discord Tickets](https://img.eartharoid.me/insecure/plain/https://static.eartharoid.me/discord-tickets/logo/wordmark/gradient-by-eartharoid.png@png)

An open-source ticket management bot for Discord - a free alternative to the premium and white-label plans of other popular ticketing bots.

[![ProductHunt](https://api.producthunt.com/widgets/embed-image/v1/review.svg?post_id=321112&theme=light)](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/discord-tickets?utm_source=badge-review&utm_medium=badge&utm_souce=badge-discord-tickets#discussion-body)

## What is this?

Discord Tickets is a Discord bot for creating and managing ticket channels. It is a free and open-source alternative to the paid ""premium"" and ""white-label"" plans of popular ticketing bots, such as [Ticket Tool](https://tickettool.xyz/), [TicketsBot](https://ticketsbot.net/), [Tickety](https://tickety.net/), [Helper.gg](https://helper.gg/), [Helper](https://helper.wtf), and others.

Discord Tickets is feature-rich and much more customisable than many of the bots mentioned above. As it is intended for self-hosting, the bot can have your community/company's logo, for free.

Although intended for use in a single Discord server, the bot can also function in multiple servers at once if you run more than one community.

### Features

Discord Tickets is packed full of features, many of which were suggested by its users. If it's missing a feature you want, you can:

- Create a plugin for it, if you can code JavaScript
- Request someone else to make a plugin
- [Submit a feature request](https://github.com/discord-tickets/.github/blob/main//CONTRIBUTING.md#submitting-a-feature-request) if you think many other users would benefit from it

Here's some of the things that makes Discord Tickets awesome:

1. **Highly customisable**  
Some messages can be configured for each server and for each ticket category. Every other message is set in the locale files, making it relatively easy to override the default messages.
You can also configure the functionality of the bot to your liking and add commands with plugins.

2. **Localisable**  
If the bot hasn't already been translated to your (community's) language, you can [translate](https://github.com/discord-tickets/.github/blob/main//CONTRIBUTING.md#translating) it yourself.
Plugin authors are encouraged to support multiple languages as well.


<details>
	<summary>Translation status</summary>

	<img src=""https://i18n.capestar.net/widgets/discord-tickets/-/bot/multi-auto.svg"" alt=""Weblate"" />
	</a>
</details>

3. **Multiple ticket categories**  
Each ticket category has its own settings for messages and the support team roles. There's also multiple methods of creating a ticket.

4. **A beautiful ticket archives portal**  
**\[COMING SOON\] :** Add the official [Discord Tickets Portal](https://github.com/discord-tickets/portal) plugin for an instant ticket archives website.

    You can use [text transcripts](https://discordtickets.app/plugins/official/text-transcripts/) whilst you wait for the portal.

5. **Open-source and self-hosted**  
It's yours, you have full control.

## Plugins

Please see the [plugins repository](https://github.com/go-chat-bot/plugins) for a complete list of plugins.

You can also write your own, it's really simple.

## Compiling and testing the bot and plugins (Debug)

This project uses the new [Go 1.11 modules](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules) if you have Go 1.11 installed, just clone the project and follow the instructions bellow, when you build Go will automatically download all dependencies.

To test the bot, use the [debug](https://github.com/go-chat-bot/bot/tree/master/debug) console app.

- Clone this repository or use `go get github.com/go-chat-bot/bot`
- Build everything: `go build ./...`
- Build and execute the debug app:
  -  `cd debug`
  -  `go build`
  -  `./debug`
- This will open a console where you can type commands
- Type `!help` to see the list of available commands

### Testing your plugin

- Add your plugin to `debug/main.go` import list
- Build the debug app
- Execute it and test with the interactive console

## Protocols

### Slack

To deploy your go-bot to Slack, you need to:

* [Create a new bot user](https://my.slack.com/services/new/bot) integration on Slack and get your token
* Import the package `github.com/go-chat-bot/bot/slack`
* Import the commands you would like to use
* Call `slack.Run(token)`

Here is a full example reading the Slack token from the `SLACK_TOKEN` env var:

```Go
package main

import (
    ""os""

    ""github.com/go-chat-bot/bot/slack""
    _ ""github.com/go-chat-bot/plugins/catfacts""
    _ ""github.com/go-chat-bot/plugins/catgif""
    _ ""github.com/go-chat-bot/plugins/chucknorris""
    // Import all the commands you wish to use
)

func main() {
    slack.Run(os.Getenv(""SLACK_TOKEN""))
}
```

### IRC

To deploy your own go-bot to IRC, you need to:

* Import the package `github.com/go-chat-bot/bot/irc`
* Import the commands you would like to use
* Fill the Config struct
* Call `irc.Run(config)`

Here is a full example:
```Go
package main

import (
	""github.com/go-chat-bot/bot/irc""
	_ ""github.com/go-chat-bot/plugins/catfacts""
	_ ""github.com/go-chat-bot/plugins/catgif""
	_ ""github.com/go-chat-bot/plugins/chucknorris""
	// Import all the commands you wish to use
	""os""
	""strings""
)

func main() {
	irc.Run(&irc.Config{
		Server:   os.Getenv(""IRC_SERVER""),
		Channels: strings.Split(os.Getenv(""IRC_CHANNELS""), "",""),
		User:     os.Getenv(""IRC_USER""),
		Nick:     os.Getenv(""IRC_NICK""),
		Password: os.Getenv(""IRC_PASSWORD""),
		UseTLS:   true,
		Debug:    os.Getenv(""DEBUG"") != """",})
}
```

To join channels with passwords just put the password after the channel name separated by a space:

    Channels: []string{""#mychannel mypassword"", ""#go-bot""}

### Telegram

To deploy your go-bot to Telegram, you need to:

* Follow Telegram instructions to [create a new bot user](https://core.telegram.org/bots#3-how-do-i-create-a-bot) and get your token
* Import the package `github.com/go-chat-bot/bot/telegram`
* Import the commands you would like to use
* Call `telegram.Run(token, debug)`

Here is a full example reading the telegram token from the `TELEGRAM_TOKEN` env var:

```Go
package main

import (
    ""os""

    ""github.com/go-chat-bot/bot/telegram""
    _ ""github.com/go-chat-bot/plugins/catfacts""
    _ ""github.com/go-chat-bot/plugins/catgif""
    _ ""github.com/go-chat-bot/plugins/chucknorris""
    // Import all the commands you wish to use
)

func main() {
    telegram.Run(os.Getenv(""TELEGRAM_TOKEN""), os.Getenv(""DEBUG"") != """")
}
```

### Rocket.chat

To deploy your go-bot to Rocket.chat, you need to:

* Import the package `github.com/go-chat-bot/bot/rocket`
* Import the commands you would like to use
* Call `rocket.Run(config)`

Here is a full example:

```Go
package main

import (
	""os""

	""github.com/go-chat-bot/bot/rocket""
	_ ""github.com/go-chat-bot/plugins/godoc""
	_ ""github.com/go-chat-bot/plugins/catfacts""
	_ ""github.com/go-chat-bot/plugins/catgif""
	_ ""github.com/go-chat-bot/plugins/chucknorris""
)

func main() {
	config := &rocket.Config{
		Server:   os.Getenv(""ROCKET_SERVER""),
		Port:     os.Getenv(""ROCKET_PORT""),
		User:     os.Getenv(""ROCKET_USER""),
		Email:    os.Getenv(""ROCKET_EMAIL""),
		Password: os.Getenv(""ROCKET_PASSWORD""),
		UseTLS:   false,
		Debug:    os.Getenv(""DEBUG"") != """",
	}
	rocket.Run(config)
}
```

### Google Chat

To deploy your go-bot to Google Chat (also known as Hangouts Chat, not plain
Hangouts) you will first need to follow documentation to [setup pub/sub
project](https://developers.google.com/hangouts/chat/how-tos/pub-sub) in Google
Cloud. This will enable your bot to receive messages even when it is behind a
firewall.

Condensed, the steps you will need to take are as follows:
* Create new project in google cloud console
  * ID of the project will be used in Config.PubSubProject
* Create service credentials for this project
  * Path to downloaded credentials file should be in env variable GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS
  * Choose ""Pub/Sub Editor"" role for the credential
* Enable Pub/Sub API in cloud console
* Create new topic in the Pub/Sub (say ""google-chat"")
  * Use the value of ""Topic Name"" (**not** ""Topic ID"") for Config.TopicName (e.g. /project/<proj_name>/topics/<topic_name>)
* Modify permissions on created topic so that
  ""chat-api-push@system.gserviceaccount.com"" has Pub/Sub Publisher permissions
* Enable hangouts chat api in Cloud Console
* Go to hangouts chat API config in the Cloud Console and fill in info
  * Connection settings - use Pub/Sub and fill in topic string you created
    above

Config.SubscriptionName should be unique for each environment or you'll not
process messages correctly. If you encounter issues make sure your credentials
are correct and permissions for topics/queues are set up correctly.

Config.WelcomeMessage is sent each time the bot joins a new room or private chat.

Full example is here:
```Go
package main

import (
	""os""

	""github.com/go-chat-bot/bot/google-chat""
	_ ""github.com/go-chat-bot/plugins/godoc""
	_ ""github.com/go-chat-bot/plugins/catfacts""
	_ ""github.com/go-chat-bot/plugins/catgif""
	_ ""github.com/go-chat-bot/plugins/chucknorris""
)

func main() {
	googlechat.Run(&googlechat.Config{
		PubSubProject:    os.Getenv(""HANGOUTS_PROJECT""),
		TopicName:        os.Getenv(""HANGOUTS_TOPIC""),
		SubscriptionName: os.Getenv(""HANGOUTS_SUB""),
		WelcomeMessage:   os.Getenv(""HANGOUTS_WELCOME""),
}

```

I don't have time to maintain this anymore. I basically wrote the whole library in a rush, without tests, while being a serious expert beginner at the time. As a result, there's a lot of unpredictable moving parts and the tests probably aren't that great either. Don't really know, since I haven't touched this in ages.

I'd recommend you to use the official BottomNavigationView from Google and urge them to implement the features you need. Or use another 3rd party library.

## Version 2.0 released!

[The latest version before that can be found in the v1 branch](https://github.com/roughike/BottomBar/tree/v1)

* Cleaner code and better APIs
* No more unnecessary stuff or spaghetti mess
* Now the look, feel and behavior is defined in XML, as it should be
* No more nasty regressions, thanks to the automated tests
* **Everything is a little different compared to earlier, but it's for the greater good!**

[How to contribute](https://github.com/roughike/BottomBar/blob/master/README.md#contributions)

[Changelog](https://github.com/roughike/BottomBar/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)

## What?

A custom view component that mimics the new [Material Design Bottom Navigation pattern](https://www.google.com/design/spec/components/bottom-navigation.html).

## Does it work on my Grandpa Gary's HTC Dream?

Nope. The minSDK version is **API level 11 (Honeycomb).**

## Gimme that Gradle sweetness, pls?

```groovy
compile 'com.roughike:bottom-bar:2.3.1'
```

**Maven:**
```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.roughike</groupId>
  <artifactId>bottom-bar</artifactId>
  <version>2.3.1</version>
  <type>pom</type>
</dependency>
```

## How?

You can add items by **writing a XML resource file**.

### Creating the icons

The icons must be fully opaque, solid black color, 24dp and **with no padding**. For example, [with Android Asset Studio Generic Icon generator](https://romannurik.github.io/AndroidAssetStudio/icons-generic.html), select ""TRIM"" and make sure the padding is 0dp. Here's what your icons should look like:

![Sample icons](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/roughike/BottomBar/master/graphics/icons-howto.png)

### Adding items from XML resource

Define your tabs in an XML resource file.

**res/xml/bottombar_tabs.xml:**

```xml
<tabs>
    <tab
        id=""@+id/tab_favorites""
        icon=""@drawable/ic_favorites""
        title=""Favorites"" />
    <tab
        id=""@+id/tab_nearby""
        icon=""@drawable/ic_nearby""
        title=""Nearby"" />
    <tab
        id=""@+id/tab_friends""
        icon=""@drawable/ic_friends""
        title=""Friends"" />
</tabs>
```

Then, add the BottomBar to your layout and give it a resource id for your tabs xml file.

**layout/activity_main.xml**

```xml
<RelativeLayout xmlns:android=""http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android""
    android:layout_width=""match_parent""
    android:layout_height=""match_parent""
    xmlns:app=""http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto"">

    <!-- This could be your fragment container, or something -->
    <FrameLayout
        android:id=""@+id/contentContainer""
        android:layout_width=""match_parent""
        android:layout_height=""match_parent""
        android:layout_above=""@+id/bottomBar"" />

    <com.roughike.bottombar.BottomBar
        android:id=""@+id/bottomBar""
        android:layout_width=""match_parent""
        android:layout_height=""60dp""
        android:layout_alignParentBottom=""true""
        app:bb_tabXmlResource=""@xml/bottombar_tabs"" />

</RelativeLayout>
```

### Setting up listeners

By default, the tabs don't do anything unless you listen for selection events and do something when the tabs are selected.

**MainActivity.java:**

```java
public class MainActivity extends Activity {
    @Override
    protected void onCreate(@Nullable Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);

        BottomBar bottomBar = (BottomBar) findViewById(R.id.bottomBar);
        bottomBar.setOnTabSelectListener(new OnTabSelectListener() {
            @Override
            public void onTabSelected(@IdRes int tabId) {
                if (tabId == R.id.tab_favorites) {
                    // The tab with id R.id.tab_favorites was selected,
                    // change your content accordingly.
                }
            }
        });
    }
}
```

If you want to listen for reselection events, here's how you do it:

```java
bottomBar.setOnTabReselectListener(new OnTabReselectListener() {
    @Override
    public void onTabReSelected(@IdRes int tabId) {
        if (tabId == R.id.tab_favorites) {
            // The tab with id R.id.tab_favorites was reselected,
            // change your content accordingly.
        }
    }
});
```

### Intercepting tab selections

If you want to conditionally cancel selection of any tab, you absolutely can. Just assign a ```TabSelectionInterceptor``` to the BottomBar, and return true from the ```shouldInterceptTabSelection()``` method.

```java
bottomBar.setTabSelectionInterceptor(new TabSelectionInterceptor() {
    @Override
    public boolean shouldInterceptTabSelection(@IdRes int oldTabId, @IdRes int newTabId) {
        if (newTabId == R.id.tab_pro_feature && !userHasProVersion()) {
          startProVersionPurchaseFlow();
          return true;
        }
        
        return false;
    }
});
```

### Changing icons based on selection state

If you want to have different icon when a specific tab is selected, just use state list drawables.

**res/drawable/my_tab_icon.xml**

```xml
<selector xmlns:android=""http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"">
    <item android:drawable=""@drawable/ic_myicon_selected"" android:state_selected=""true"" />
    <item android:drawable=""@drawable/ic_myicon_default"" android:state_selected=""false"" />
</selector>
```

**res/xml/bottombar_tabs.xml**

```xml
...
<tab
    id=""@+id/tab_favorites""
    icon=""@drawable/my_tab_icon""
    title=""Favorites"" />
<!-- You can use @color resources too! -->
...
```

### Those color changing tabs look dope. Howdoidodat?

Just add ```barColorWhenSelected``` to each tab. When that tab is selected, the whole BottomBar background color is changed with a nice animation.

**res/xml/bottombar_tabs.xml**

```xml
<tabs>
    <tab
        id=""@+id/tab_favorites""
        icon=""@drawable/ic_favorites""
        title=""Favorites""
        barColorWhenSelected=""#5D4037"" />
    <!-- You can use @color resources too! -->
</tabs>
```

### How do I draw it under the navbar?

First, define a style that is a child of your main application theme:

**res/values-v21/styles.xml**

```xml
<style name=""AppTheme.TransNav"" parent=""AppTheme"">
    <item name=""android:navigationBarColor"">@android:color/transparent</item>
    <item name=""android:windowTranslucentNavigation"">true</item>
    <item name=""android:windowDrawsSystemBarBackgrounds"">true</item>
</style>
```

You'll also have to **make a stub version of the same theme** to avoid crashes in previous API levels than Lollipop:

**res/values/styles.xml**

```xml
<style name=""AppTheme.TransNav"" parent=""AppTheme"" />
```

Also include the same stub in your ```values-land-v21.xml``` to avoid transparent navbar and weird behavior on landscape.

**res/values-land-v21.xml:**

```xml
<style name=""AppTheme.TransNav"" parent=""AppTheme"" />
```

Apply the theme in ```AndroidManifest.xml``` for your Activity.

**AndroidManifest.xml:**

```xml
<activity android:name="".MyAwesomeActivity"" android:theme=""@style/AppTheme.TransNav"" />
```

Finally, set ```bb_behavior``` to include the ```underNavbar``` flag and you're good to go!

**activity_my_awesome.xml:**

```xml
<com.roughike.bottombar.BottomBar
    android:id=""@+id/bottomBar""
    android:layout_width=""match_parent""
    android:layout_height=""56dp""
    android:layout_alignParentBottom=""true""
    app:bb_tabXmlResource=""@xml/my_awesome_bottombar_tabs""
    app:bb_behavior=""underNavbar"" />
```

### What about Tablets?

Specify a different layout for your activity in ```res/layout-sw600dp``` folder and set ```bb_tabletMode``` to true.

**res/layout-sw600dp/activity_main.xml:**

```xml
<RelativeLayout
    xmlns:android=""http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android""
    xmlns:app=""http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto""
    android:layout_width=""match_parent""
    android:layout_height=""match_parent"">

    <com.roughike.bottombar.BottomBar
        android:id=""@+id/bottomBar""
        android:layout_width=""wrap_content""
        android:layout_height=""match_parent""
        android:layout_alignParentLeft=""true""
        app:bb_tabXmlResource=""@xml/bottombar_tabs_three""
        app:bb_tabletMode=""true"" />

    <!-- This could be your fragment container, or something -->
    <FrameLayout
        android:id=""@+id/contentContainer""
        android:layout_width=""match_parent""
        android:layout_height=""match_parent""
        android:layout_toRightOf=""@+id/bottomBar"" />

</RelativeLayout>
```

### How do I hide it automatically on scroll?

Easy-peasy!

**activity_main.xml:**

```xml
<android.support.design.widget.CoordinatorLayout xmlns:android=""http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android""
    xmlns:app=""http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto""
    android:layout_width=""match_parent""
    android:layout_height=""match_parent"">

    <android.support.v4.widget.NestedScrollView
        android:id=""@+id/myScrollingContent""
        android:layout_width=""match_parent""
        android:layout_height=""match_parent"">

        <!-- Your loooooong scrolling content here. -->

    </android.support.v4.widget.NestedScrollView>

    <com.roughike.bottombar.BottomBar
        android:id=""@+id/bottomBar""
        android:layout_width=""match_parent""
        android:layout_height=""60dp""
        android:layout_gravity=""bottom""
        app:bb_tabXmlResource=""@xml/bottombar_tabs_three""
        app:bb_behavior=""shy""/>

</android.support.design.widget.CoordinatorLayout>
```

### Badges

You can easily add badges for showing an unread message count or new items / whatever you like.

```java
BottomBarTab nearby = bottomBar.getTabWithId(R.id.tab_nearby);
nearby.setBadgeCount(5);

// Remove the badge when you're done with it.
nearby.removeBadge/();
```

## All customization options

Boto3 - The AWS SDK for Python
===============================

|Version| |Python| |License|

Boto3 is the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Software Development Kit (SDK) for
Python, which allows Python developers to write software that makes use
of services like Amazon S3 and Amazon EC2. You can find the latest, most
up to date, documentation at our `doc site`_, including a list of
services that are supported.

Boto3 is maintained and published by `Amazon Web Services`_.

Notices
-------

On 01/15/2021 deprecation for Python 2.7 was announced and support was dropped
on 07/15/2021. To avoid disruption, customers using Boto3 on Python 2.7 may
need to upgrade their version of Python or pin the version of Boto3. For
more information, see this `blog post <https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/developer/announcing-end-of-support-for-python-2-7-in-aws-sdk-for-python-and-aws-cli-v1/>`__.

Starting in May 2022, we will be dropping support for Python 3.6. This follows the Python Software Foundation `end of support <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0494/#lifespan>`__ for the runtime which occurred on 2021-12-23.

    :alt: License

Getting Started
---------------
Assuming that you have Python and ``virtualenv`` installed, set up your environment and install the required dependencies like this or you can install the library using ``pip``:

.. code-block:: sh

    $ git clone https://github.com/boto/boto3.git
    $ cd boto3
    $ virtualenv venv
    ...
    $ . venv/bin/activate
    $ python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
    $ python -m pip install -e .

.. code-block:: sh

    $ python -m pip install boto3


Using Boto3
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
After installing boto3

Next, set up credentials (in e.g. ``~/.aws/credentials``):

.. code-block:: ini

    [default]
    aws_access_key_id = YOUR_KEY
    aws_secret_access_key = YOUR_SECRET

Then, set up a default region (in e.g. ``~/.aws/config``):

.. code-block:: ini

   [default]
   region=us-east-1

Other credentials configuration method can be found `here <https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/guide/credentials.html>`__

Then, from a Python interpreter:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> import boto3
    >>> s3 = boto3.resource('s3')
    >>> for bucket in s3.buckets.all():
            print(bucket.name)

Running Tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You can run tests in all supported Python versions using ``tox``. By default,
it will run all of the unit and functional tests, but you can also specify your own
``pytest`` options. Note that this requires that you have all supported
versions of Python installed, otherwise you must pass ``-e`` or run the
``pytest`` command directly:

.. code-block:: sh

    $ tox
    $ tox -- unit/test_session.py
    $ tox -e py26,py33 -- integration/

You can also run individual tests with your default Python version:

.. code-block:: sh

    $ pytest tests/unit

The **[Bag of Tricks](http://github.com/thinkpixellab/bot)** (BOT) Started in December 2005. [Kevin](http://github.com/kevmoo) was working at Microsoft on v1 of Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF). He was blogging a lot of code samples and wanted to keep them all together and ensure everything kept working as features changed and evolved as WPF moved towards shipping.

The **BOT** grew to be an important resource for those learning and pushing the capabilities of WPF.

It now includes a set of helper libraries that are generally useful for .NET programming with an emphasis on building GUI applications targetting WPF (v4), Silverlight (v4) and Windows Phone 7.

It is actively maintained by [Kevin](http://github.com/kevmoo) and your friends at [Pixel Lab](http://thinkpixellab.com ""Pixel Lab"").

### NuGet
The **BOT** is on [NuGet](http://nuget.org/). Search for [PixelLab.BOT](http://nuget.org/List/Packages/PixelLab.BOT).

### Code Contracts
Parts of the **Bag of Tricks** are built using [Code Contracts](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/devlabs/dd491992.aspx). You may wish to install and use these tools when you are working with **BOT**.

# ChatterBot

ChatterBot is a machine-learning based conversational dialog engine build in
Python which makes it possible to generate responses based on collections of
known conversations. The language independent design of ChatterBot allows it
to be trained to speak any language.

An example of typical input would be something like this:

> **user:** Good morning! How are you doing?  
> **bot:**  I am doing very well, thank you for asking.  
> **user:** You're welcome.  
> **bot:** Do you like hats?  

## How it works

An untrained instance of ChatterBot starts off with no knowledge of how to communicate. Each time a user enters a statement, the library saves the text that they entered and the text that the statement was in response to. As ChatterBot receives more input the number of responses that it can reply and the accuracy of each response in relation to the input statement increase. The program selects the closest matching response by searching for the closest matching known statement that matches the input, it then returns the most likely response to that statement based on how frequently each response is issued by the people the bot communicates with.

## Installation

This package can be installed from [PyPi](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/ChatterBot) by running:

```
pip install chatterbot
```

## Basic Usage

```
from chatterbot import ChatBot
from chatterbot.trainers import ChatterBotCorpusTrainer

chatbot = ChatBot('Ron Obvious')

# Create a new trainer for the chatbot
trainer = ChatterBotCorpusTrainer(chatbot)

# Train the chatbot based on the english corpus
trainer.train(""chatterbot.corpus.english"")

# Get a response to an input statement
chatbot.get_response(""Hello, how are you today?"")
```

# Training data

ChatterBot comes with a data utility module that can be used to train chat bots.
At the moment there is training data for over a dozen languages in this module.
Contributions of additional training data or training data
in other languages would be greatly appreciated. Take a look at the data files
in the [chatterbot-corpus](https://github.com/gunthercox/chatterbot-corpus)
package if you are interested in contributing.

```
from chatterbot.trainers import ChatterBotCorpusTrainer

# Create a new trainer for the chatbot
trainer = ChatterBotCorpusTrainer(chatbot)

# Train based on the english corpus
trainer.train(""chatterbot.corpus.english"")

# Train based on english greetings corpus
trainer.train(""chatterbot.corpus.english.greetings"")

# Train based on the english conversations corpus
trainer.train(""chatterbot.corpus.english.conversations"")
```

## Tutorial

Here's a tutorial to set up BotsApp on your own account in *less than 3 minutes.*

[![Join WhatsApp Group](https://img.shields.io/badge/How%20To-Deploy-red.svg?logo=Youtube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGrjEZ3roY0&ab_channel=BotsApp)

## Deployment

### Easiest Way

You can deploy BotsApp in minimal time without any prior knowledge using this method.

1. Head over to BotsApp's [Official website](https://mybotsapp.com/) and create an account on heroku using your email ID.
2. Once logged in, click on the ""Deploy BotsApp"" button in the sidebar.
3. Scan the QR code shown using your WhatsApp account (3 dots on top right corner -> Linked devices -> LINK A DEVICE). Click on the 'Continue'      button once done.
4. Once the bot is linked to your account, you will come across a form which can be used to manage settings/permissions of BotsApp. If required,    change the form fields. Then, click on the submit button.
5. Wait for 1-3 minutes for the bot to start. This is a one time process. Try using the '.alive' command in any of your chats to verify whether    your bot has been deployed succesfully.

Voila! You have deployed your bot in 5 easy steps. Once the bot has started successfully, you'll see a integration message on your whatsapp account.

### Manually on Heroku

You can deploy the bot the heroku yourself using the button below!

[![Deploy To Heroku](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://dashboard.heroku.com/new?button-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FBotsAppOfficial%2FBotsApp%2Ftree%2Fmain&template=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FBotsAppOfficial%2FBotsApp%2Ftree%2Fmainhttps://dashboard.heroku.com/new?button-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FBotsAppOfficial%2FBotsApp%2Ftree%2Fmain&template=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FBotsAppOfficial%2FBotsApp%2Ftree%2Fmain)

### Using Docker locally

To follow this method, you will need to have docker installed on your machine and have some experience using docker.

To host the bot on your own device using docker, follow the following steps on your terminal / command prompt -

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BotsAppOfficial/BotsApp.git
cd BotsApp
docker build -t botsapp .
docker run --rm --name botsapp botsapp
```

This will create a container running BotsApp. You'll have to scan the QR at least once.

### The GNU/Linux Legacy Way

To use this method, you will need ffmpeg, nodejs, npm installed on your device.

To run the bot on your device manually, you can use the following commands -

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BotsAppOfficial/BotsApp.git
cd BotsApp
npm install
npm start
```

> Automated cryptocurrency trading bot

## Why?

This project was inspired by the observation that all cryptocurrencies pretty much behave in the same way. When one spikes, they all spike, and when one takes a dive, they all do. _Pretty much_. Moreover, all coins follow Bitcoin's lead; the difference is their phase offset.

So, if coins are basically oscillating with respect to each other, it seems smart to trade the rising coin for the falling coin, and then trade back when the ratio is reversed.

## How?

The trading is done in the Binance market platform, which of course, does not have markets for every altcoin pair. The workaround for this is to use a bridge currency that will complement missing pairs. The default bridge currency is Tether (USDT), which is stable by design and compatible with nearly every coin on the platform.

<p align=""center"">
  Coin A → USDT → Coin B
</p>

The way the bot takes advantage of the observed behaviour is to always downgrade from the ""strong"" coin to the ""weak"" coin, under the assumption that at some point the tables will turn. It will then return to the original coin, ultimately holding more of it than it did originally. This is done while taking into consideration the trading fees.

<div align=""center"">
  <p><b>Coin A</b> → USDT → Coin B</p>
  <p>Coin B → USDT → Coin C</p>
  <p>...</p>
  <p>Coin C → USDT → <b>Coin A</b></p>
</div>

The bot jumps between a configured set of coins on the condition that it does not return to a coin unless it is profitable in respect to the amount held last. This means that we will never end up having less of a certain coin. The risk is that one of the coins may freefall relative to the others all of a sudden, attracting our reverse greedy algorithm.

## Binance Setup

-   Create a [Binance account](https://www.binance.com/en/register?ref=13222128) (Includes my referral link, I'll be super grateful if you use it).
-   Enable Two-factor Authentication.
-   Create a new API key.
-   Get a cryptocurrency. If its symbol is not in the default list, add it.

## Tool Setup

### Install Python dependencies

Run the following line in the terminal: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

### Create user configuration

Create a .cfg file named `user.cfg` based off `.user.cfg.example`, then add your API keys and current coin.

**The configuration file consists of the following fields:**

-   **api_key** - Binance API key generated in the Binance account setup stage.
-   **api_secret_key** - Binance secret key generated in the Binance account setup stage.
-   **current_coin** - This is your starting coin of choice. This should be one of the coins from your supported coin list. If you want to start from your bridge currency, leave this field empty - the bot will select a random coin from your supported coin list and buy it.
-   **bridge** - Your bridge currency of choice. Notice that different bridges will allow different sets of supported coins. For example, there may be a Binance particular-coin/USDT pair but no particular-coin/BUSD pair.
-   **tld** - 'com' or 'us', depending on your region. Default is 'com'.
-   **hourToKeepScoutHistory** - Controls how many hours of scouting values are kept in the database. After the amount of time specified has passed, the information will be deleted.
-   **scout_sleep_time** - Controls how many seconds are waited between each scout.
-   **use_margin** - 'yes' to use scout_margin. 'no' to use scout_multiplier.
-   **scout_multiplier** - Controls the value by which the difference between the current state of coin ratios and previous state of ratios is multiplied. For bigger values, the bot will wait for bigger margins to arrive before making a trade.
-   **scout_margin** - Minimum percentage coin gain per trade. 0.8 translates to a scout multiplier of 5 at 0.1% fee.
-   **strategy** - The trading strategy to use. See [`binance_trade_bot/strategies`](binance_trade_bot/strategies/README.md) for more information
-   **buy_timeout/sell_timeout** - Controls how many minutes to wait before cancelling a limit order (buy/sell) and returning to ""scout"" mode. 0 means that the order will never be cancelled prematurely.
-   **scout_sleep_time** - Controls how many seconds bot should wait between analysis of current prices. Since the bot now operates on websockets this value should be set to something low (like 1), the reasons to set it above 1 are when you observe high CPU usage by bot or you got api errors about requests weight limit.

#### Environment Variables

All of the options provided in `user.cfg` can also be configured using environment variables.

```
CURRENT_COIN_SYMBOL:
SUPPORTED_COIN_LIST: ""XLM TRX ICX EOS IOTA ONT QTUM ETC ADA XMR DASH NEO ATOM DOGE VET BAT OMG BTT""
BRIDGE_SYMBOL: USDT
API_KEY: vmPUZE6mv9SD5VNHk4HlWFsOr6aKE2zvsw0MuIgwCIPy6utIco14y7Ju91duEh8A
API_SECRET_KEY: NhqPtmdSJYdKjVHjA7PZj4Mge3R5YNiP1e3UZjInClVN65XAbvqqM6A7H5fATj0j
SCOUT_MULTIPLIER: 5
SCOUT_SLEEP_TIME: 1
TLD: com
STRATEGY: default
BUY_TIMEOUT: 0
SELL_TIMEOUT: 0
```

### Paying Fees with BNB
You can [use BNB to pay for any fees on the Binance platform](https://www.binance.com/en/support/faq/115000583311-Using-BNB-to-Pay-for-Fees), which will reduce all fees by 25%. In order to support this benefit, the bot will always perform the following operations:
-   Automatically detect that you have BNB fee payment enabled.
-   Make sure that you have enough BNB in your account to pay the fee of the inspected trade.
-   Take into consideration the discount when calculating the trade threshold.

### Notifications with Apprise

Apprise allows the bot to send notifications to all of the most popular notification services available such as: Telegram, Discord, Slack, Amazon SNS, Gotify, etc.

To set this up you need to create a apprise.yml file in the config directory.

There is an example version of this file to get you started.

If you are interested in running a Telegram bot, more information can be found at [Telegram's official documentation](https://core.telegram.org/bots).

### Run

```shell
python -m binance_trade_bot
```

### Docker

The official image is available [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/edeng23/binance-trade-bot) and will update on every new change.

```shell
docker-compose up
```

If you only want to start the SQLite browser

```shell
docker-compose up -d sqlitebrowser
```

## Backtesting

You can test the bot on historic data to see how it performs.

```shell
python backtest.py
```

Feel free to modify that file to test and compare different settings and time periods

## Developing

To make sure your code is properly formatted before making a pull request,
remember to install [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/):

```shell
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```

The scouting algorithm is unlikely to be changed. If you'd like to contribute an alternative
method, [add a new strategy](binance_trade_bot/strategies/README.md).

### [Click here to find out what is new in Web Chat](https://github.com/microsoft/BotFramework-WebChat/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md)

# Bot Framework Web Chat

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/botframework-webchat.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/botframework-webchat)
[![Build Status](https://fuselabs.visualstudio.com/BotFramework-WebChat/_apis/build/status/BotFramework-WebChat-daily?branchName=main)](https://fuselabs.visualstudio.com/BotFramework-WebChat/_build/latest?definitionId=498&branchName=main)

This repository contains code for the Bot Framework Web Chat component. The Bot Framework Web Chat component is a highly-customizable web-based client for the Bot Framework V4 SDK. The Bot Framework SDK v4 enables developers to model conversation and build sophisticated bot applications.

This repo is part of the [Microsoft Bot Framework](https://github.com/microsoft/botframework) - a comprehensive framework for building enterprise-grade conversational AI experiences.

# Version notes

> This section points out important version notes. For further information, please see the related links and check the [`CHANGELOG.md`](https://github.com/microsoft/BotFramework-WebChat/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md)

### 4.12.1 patch: New style property `adaptiveCardsParserMaxVersion`

Web Chat 4.12.1 patch includes a new style property allowing developers to choose the max Adaptive Cards schema version. See [PR #3778](https://github.com/microsoft/BotFramework-WebChat/pull/3778) for code changes.

To specify a different max version, you can adjust the style options, shown below:

```js
window.WebChat.renderWebChat(
   {
      directLine,
      store,
      styleOptions: {
         adaptiveCardsParserMaxVersion: '1.2'
      }
   },
   document.getElementById('webchat')
);
```

-  Web Chat will apply the maximum schema available according to the Adaptive Cards version (as of this patch, schema 1.3) by default.
-  An invalid version will revert to Web Chat's default.

## Visual focus changes to transcript in Web Chat 4.12.0

A new accessibility update has been added to Web Chat from PR [#3703](https://github.com/microsoft/BotFramework-WebChat/pull/3703). This change creates visual focus for the transcript (bold black border) and `aria-activedescendent` focused activity (black dashed border) by default. Where applicable, `transcriptVisualKeyboardIndicator...` values will also be applied to carousel (`CarouselFilmStrip.js`) children. This is done in order to match current default focus styling for Adaptive Cards, which may be a child of a carousel.

To modify these styles, you can change the following props via `styleOptions`:

```
  transcriptActivityVisualKeyboardIndicatorColor: DEFAULT_SUBTLE,
  transcriptActivityVisualKeyboardIndicatorStyle: 'dashed',
  transcriptActivityVisualKeyboardIndicatorWidth: 1,
  transcriptVisualKeyboardIndicatorColor: 'Black',
  transcriptVisualKeyboardIndicatorStyle: 'solid',
  transcriptVisualKeyboardIndicatorWidth: 2,
```

The above code shows the default values you will see in Web Chat.

## API refactor into new package in Web Chat 4.11.0

The Web Chat API has been refactored into a separate package. To learn more, check out the [API refactor summary](https://github.com/microsoft/BotFramework-WebChat/pull/3543).

## Direct Line Speech support in Web Chat 4.7.0

Starting from Web Chat 4.7.0, Direct Line Speech is supported, and it is the preferred way to provide an integrated speech functionality in Web Chat. We are working on [closing feature gaps](https://github.com/microsoft/BotFramework-WebChat/labels/Direct%20Line%20Speech) between Direct Line Speech and Web Speech API (includes Cognitive Services and browser-provided speech functionality).

## Upgrading to 4.6.0

Starting from Web Chat 4.6.0, Web Chat requires React 16.8.6 or up.

Although we recommend that you upgrade your host app at your earliest convenience, we understand that host app may need some time before its React dependencies are updated, especially in regards to huge applications.

If your app is not ready for React 16.8.6 yet, you can follow the [hybrid React sample](https://github.com/microsoft/BotFramework-WebChat/tree/main/samples/01.getting-started/g.hybrid-react-npm) to dual-host React in your app.

## Speech changes in Web Chat 4.5.0

There is a breaking change on behavior expectations regarding speech and input hint in Web Chat. Please refer to the section on [input hint behavior before 4.5.0](https://github.com/microsoft/BotFramework-WebChat/blob/main/docs/SPEECH.md#input-hint-behavior-before-4-5-0) for details.

## Migrating from Web Chat v3 to v4

[View migration docs](https://github.com/microsoft/BotFramework-WebChat/tree/main/docs/MIGRATION.md) to learn about migrating from Web Chat v3.

<hr />

# How to use

First, create a bot using [Azure Bot Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/bot-service/).
Once the bot is created, you will need to [obtain the bot's Web Chat secret](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/bot-service-channel-connect-webchat?view=azure-bot-service-3.0#step-1) in Azure Portal. Then use the secret to [generate a token](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/rest-api/bot-framework-rest-direct-line-3-0-authentication?view=azure-bot-service-4.0) and pass it to your Web Chat.

## Connect a client app to bot

Web Chat provides UI on top of the Direct Line and Direct Line Speech Channels. There are two ways to connect to your bot through HTTP calls from the client: by sending the Bot secret or generating a token via the secret.

<!-- TODO: https://github.com/microsoft/BotFramework-WebChat/issues/2151 (ongoing) -->
<!-- Update the following paragraph and the API table (`directline`) with new documentation when updated docs are published  -->

We strongly recommend using the token API instead of providing the app with your secret. To learn more about why, see the [authentication documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/rest-api/bot-framework-rest-direct-line-3-0-authentication?view=azure-bot-service-4.0) on the [token API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/rest-api/bot-framework-rest-direct-line-3-0-api-reference?view=azure-bot-service-4.0) and client security.

For further reading, please see the following links:

-  [Enhanced Direct Line authentication features](https://blog.botframework.com/2018/09/25/enhanced-direct-line-authentication-features/)

## Integrate with JavaScript

Web Chat is designed to integrate with your existing website using JavaScript or React. Integrating with JavaScript will give you moderate styling and customizability options.

You can use the full, typical Web Chat package (called full-feature bundle) that contains the most typically used features.

Here is how how you can add Web Chat control to your website:

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <script
      crossorigin=""anonymous""
      src=""https://cdn.botframework.com/botframework-webchat/latest/webchat.js""
    ></script>
    <style>
      html,
      body {
         height: 100%;
      }

      body {
        margin: 0;
      }

      #webchat {
        height: 100%;
        width: 100%;
      }
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id=""webchat"" role=""main""></div>
    <script>
      window.WebChat.renderWebChat(
        {
          directLine: window.WebChat.createDirectLine({
            token: 'YOUR_DIRECT_LINE_TOKEN'
          }),
          userID: 'YOUR_USER_ID',
          username: 'Web Chat User',
          locale: 'en-US'
        },
        document.getElementById('webchat')
      );
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

> `userID`, `username`, and `locale` are all optional parameters to pass into the `renderWebChat` method. To learn more about Web Chat props, look at the [Web Chat API Reference](https://github.com/microsoft/BotFramework-WebChat/tree/main/docs/API.md) documentation.

> Assigning `userID` as a static value is not recommended since this will cause all users to share state. Please see the [`API userID entry`](https://github.com/microsoft/BotFramework-WebChat/blob/main/docs/API.md#userID) for more information.

More information on localization can be found in the [Localization](https://github.com/microsoft/BotFramework-WebChat/tree/main/docs/LOCALIZATION.md) documentation.

![Screenshot of Web Chat](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/BotFramework-WebChat/main/media/weatherquery.png.jpg)

See the working sample of the [full Web Chat bundle](https://github.com/microsoft/BotFramework-WebChat/tree/main/samples/01.getting-started/a.full-bundle).

## Integrate with React

For full customizability, you can use React to recompose components of Web Chat.

To install the production build from NPM, run `npm install botframework-webchat`.

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
```js
import React, { useMemo } from 'react';
import ReactWebChat, { createDirectLine } from 'botframework-webchat';

export default () => {
  const directLine = useMemo(() => createDirectLine({ token: 'YOUR_DIRECT_LINE_TOKEN' }), []);

  return <ReactWebChat directLine={directLine} userID=""YOUR_USER_ID"" />;
};
```
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

> You can also run `npm install botframework-webchat@main` to install a development build that is synced with Web Chat's GitHub `main` branch.

See the working sample of [Web Chat rendered via React](https://github.com/microsoft/BotFramework-WebChat/tree/main/samples/01.getting-started/e.host-with-react/).

### Experimental support for Redux DevTools

Web Chat internally use Redux for state management. [Redux DevTools](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-devtools) is enabled in the NPM build as an opt-in feature.

This is for glancing into how Web Chat works. This is not an API explorer and is not an endorsement of using the Redux store to programmatically access the UI. The [hooks API](https://github.com/microsoft/BotFramework-WebChat/tree/main/docs/HOOKS.md) should be used instead.

To use Redux DevTools, use the `createStoreWithDevTools` function for creating a Redux DevTools-enabled store.

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
```diff
  import React, { useMemo } from 'react';
- import ReactWebChat, { createDirectLine, createStore } from 'botframework-webchat';
+ import ReactWebChat, { createDirectLine, createStoreWithDevTools } from 'botframework-webchat';

  export default () => {
    const directLine = useMemo(() => createDirectLine({ token: 'YOUR_DIRECT_LINE_TOKEN' }), []);
-   const store = useMemo(() => createStore(), []);
+   const store = useMemo(() => createStoreWithDevTools(), []);

    return <ReactWebChat directLine={directLine} store={store} userID=""YOUR_USER_ID"" />;
  };
```
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

There are some limitations when using the Redux DevTools:

-  The Redux store uses side-effects via [`redux-saga`](https://github.com/redux-saga/redux-saga). Time-traveling may break the UI.
-  Many UI states are stored in React context and state. They are not exposed in the Redux store.
-  Some time-sensitive UIs are based on real-time clock and not affected by time-traveling.
-  Dispatching actions are not officially supported. Please use [hooks API](https://github.com/microsoft/BotFramework-WebChat/tree/main/docs/HOOKS.md) instead.
-  Actions and reducers may move in and out of Redux store across versions. [Hooks API](https://github.com/microsoft/BotFramework-WebChat/tree/main/docs/HOOKS.md) is the official API for accessing the UI.

# Customizing the Web Chat UI

Web Chat is designed to be customizable without forking the source code. The table below outlines what kind of customizations you can achieve when you are importing Web Chat in different ways. This list is not exhaustive.

|                               | CDN bundle |  React   |
| ----------------------------- | :--------: | :------: |
| Change colors                 |  &#10004;  | &#10004; |
| Change sizes                  |  &#10004;  | &#10004; |
| Update/replace CSS styles     |  &#10004;  | &#10004; |
| Listen to events              |  &#10004;  | &#10004; |
| Interact with hosting webpage |  &#10004;  | &#10004; |
| Custom render activities      |            | &#10004; |
| Custom render attachments     |            | &#10004; |
| Add new UI components         |            | &#10004; |
| Recompose the whole UI        |            | &#10004; |

See more about [customizing Web Chat](https://github.com/microsoft/BotFramework-WebChat/blob/main/samples/README.md) to learn more on customization.

## Supported Activity Types on the Web Chat Client

Bot Framework has many activity types, but not all are supported in Web Chat. [View activity types docs](https://github.com/microsoft/BotFramework-WebChat/tree/main/docs/ACTIVITYTYPES.md) to learn more.

# Samples list

[View the complete list of Web Chat samples](https://github.com/microsoft/BotFramework-WebChat/tree/main/samples) for more ideas on customizing Web Chat.

# Further reading

## API Reference

View the [API documentation](https://github.com/microsoft/BotFramework-WebChat/tree/main/docs/API.md) for implementing Web Chat.

## Browser compatibility

Web Chat supports the latest 2 versions of modern browsers like Chrome, Microsoft Edge, and FireFox.
If you need Web Chat in Internet Explorer 11, please see the [ES5 bundle demo](https://microsoft.github.io/BotFramework-WebChat/01.getting-started/c.es5-bundle).

Please note, however:

-  Web Chat does not support Internet Explorer older than version 11
-  Customization as shown in non-ES5 samples are not supported for Internet Explorer. Because IE11 is a non-modern browser, it does not support ES6, and many samples that use arrow functions and modern promises would need to be manually converted to ES5. If you are in need of heavy customization for your app, we strongly recommend developing your app for a modern browser like Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge.
-  Web Chat has no plan to support samples for IE11 (ES5).
   -  For customers who wish to manually rewrite our other samples to work in IE11, we recommend looking into converting code from ES6+ to ES5 using polyfills and transpilers like [`babel`](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/next/babel-standalone.html).

Bottle: Python Web Framework
============================

Bottle is a fast, simple and lightweight WSGI_ micro web-framework for Python_. It is distributed as a single file module and has no dependencies other than the `Python Standard Library <http://docs.python.org/library/>`_.


* **Routing:** Requests to function-call mapping with support for clean and  dynamic URLs.
* **Templates:** Fast and pythonic `*built-in template engine* <http://bottlepy.org/docs/dev/tutorial.html#tutorial-templates>`_ and support for mako_, jinja2_ and cheetah_ templates.
* **Utilities:** Convenient access to form data, file uploads, cookies, headers and other HTTP-related metadata.
* **Server:** Built-in HTTP development server and support for paste_, fapws3_, bjoern_, `Google App Engine <https://cloud.google.com/appengine/>`_, cherrypy_ or any other WSGI_ capable HTTP server.

Homepage and documentation: http://bottlepy.org


Example: ""Hello World"" in a bottle
----------------------------------

.. code-block:: python

  from bottle import route, run, template

  @route('/hello/<name>')
  def index(name):
      return template('<b>Hello {{name}}</b>!', name=name)

  run(host='localhost', port=8080)

============
Introduction
============

This library provides a pure Python interface for the
`Telegram Bot API <https://core.telegram.org/bots/api>`_.
It's compatible with Python versions 3.6.8+. PTB might also work on `PyPy <http://pypy.org/>`_, though there have been a lot of issues before. Hence, PyPy is not officially supported.

In addition to the pure API implementation, this library features a number of high-level classes to
make the development of bots easy and straightforward. These classes are contained in the
``telegram.ext`` submodule.

A pure API implementation *without* ``telegram.ext`` is available as the standalone package ``python-telegram-bot-raw``.  `See here for details. <https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot/blob/master/README_RAW.rst>`_

----
Note
----

Installing both ``python-telegram-bot`` and ``python-telegram-bot-raw`` in conjunction will result in undesired side-effects, so only install *one* of both.

====================
Telegram API support
====================

All types and methods of the Telegram Bot API **5.7** are supported.

==========
Installing
==========

You can install or upgrade python-telegram-bot with:

.. code:: shell

    $ pip install python-telegram-bot --upgrade

Or you can install from source with:

.. code:: shell

    $ git clone https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot --recursive
    $ cd python-telegram-bot
    $ python setup.py install
    
In case you have a previously cloned local repository already, you should initialize the added urllib3 submodule before installing with:

.. code:: shell

    $ git submodule update --init --recursive

---------------------
Optional Dependencies
---------------------

PTB can be installed with optional dependencies:

* ``pip install python-telegram-bot[passport]`` installs the `cryptography <https://cryptography.io>`_ library. Use this, if you want to use Telegram Passport related functionality.
* ``pip install python-telegram-bot[ujson]`` installs the `ujson <https://pypi.org/project/ujson/>`_ library. It will then be used for JSON de- & encoding, which can bring speed up compared to the standard `json <https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html>`_ library.
* ``pip install python-telegram-bot[socks]`` installs the `PySocks <https://pypi.org/project/PySocks/>`_ library. Use this, if you want to work behind a Socks5 server.

===============
Getting started
===============

Our Wiki contains a lot of resources to get you started with ``python-telegram-bot``:

- `Introduction to the API <https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot/wiki/Introduction-to-the-API>`_
- Tutorial: `Your first Bot <https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot/wiki/Extensions-%E2%80%93-Your-first-Bot>`_

Other references:

- `Telegram API documentation <https://core.telegram.org/bots/api>`_
- `python-telegram-bot documentation <https://python-telegram-bot.readthedocs.io/>`_

-------------------
Learning by example
-------------------

We believe that the best way to learn this package is by example. Here
are some examples for you to review. Even if it is not your approach for learning, please take a
look at ``echobot.py``, it is the de facto base for most of the bots out there. Best of all,
the code for these examples are released to the public domain, so you can start by grabbing the
code and building on top of it.

Visit `this page <https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot/blob/master/examples/README.md>`_ to discover the official examples or look at the examples on the `wiki <https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot/wiki/Examples>`_ to see other bots the community has built.

-------
Logging
-------

This library uses the ``logging`` module. To set up logging to standard output, put:

.. code:: python

    import logging
    logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG,
                        format='%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')

at the beginning of your script.

You can also use logs in your application by calling ``logging.getLogger()`` and setting the log level you want:

.. code:: python

    logger = logging.getLogger()
    logger.setLevel(logging.INFO)

If you want DEBUG logs instead:

.. code:: python

    logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)


=============
Documentation
=============

``python-telegram-bot``'s documentation lives at `readthedocs.io <https://python-telegram-bot.readthedocs.io/>`_.

============
Getting help
============

You can get help in several ways:

1. We have a vibrant community of developers helping each other in our `Telegram group <https://telegram.me/pythontelegrambotgroup>`_. Join us!

2. Report bugs, request new features or ask questions by `creating an issue <https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot/issues/new/choose>`_ or `a discussion <https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot/discussions/new>`_.

3. Our `Wiki pages <https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot/wiki/>`_ offer a growing amount of resources.

4. You can even ask for help on Stack Overflow using the `python-telegram-bot tag <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/python-telegram-bot>`_.


============
Contributing
============

Contributions of all sizes are welcome. Please review our `contribution guidelines <https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.rst>`_ to get started. You can also help by `reporting bugs <https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot/issues/new>`_.

========
Donating
========
Occasionally we are asked if we accept donations to support the development. While we appreciate the thought, maintaining PTB is our hobby and we have almost no running costs for it. We therefore have nothing set up to accept donations. If you still want to donate, we kindly ask you to donate to another open source project/initiative of your choice instead.

## Getting started

This API is tested with Python 3.6-3.10 and Pypy 3.
There are two ways to install the library:

* Installation using pip (a Python package manager):

```
$ pip install pyTelegramBotAPI
```
* Installation from source (requires git):

```
$ git clone https://github.com/eternnoir/pyTelegramBotAPI.git
$ cd pyTelegramBotAPI
$ python setup.py install
```
or:
```
$ pip install git+https://github.com/eternnoir/pyTelegramBotAPI.git
```

It is generally recommended to use the first option.

*While the API is production-ready, it is still under development and it has regular updates, do not forget to update it regularly by calling*
```
pip install pytelegrambotapi --upgrade
```

## Writing your first bot

### Prerequisites

It is presumed that you [have obtained an API token with @BotFather](https://core.telegram.org/bots#botfather). We will call this token `TOKEN`.
Furthermore, you have basic knowledge of the Python programming language and more importantly [the Telegram Bot API](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api).

### A simple echo bot

The TeleBot class (defined in \__init__.py) encapsulates all API calls in a single class. It provides functions such as `send_xyz` (`send_message`, `send_document` etc.) and several ways to listen for incoming messages.

Create a file called `echo_bot.py`.
Then, open the file and create an instance of the TeleBot class.
```python
import telebot

bot = telebot.TeleBot(""TOKEN"", parse_mode=None) # You can set parse_mode by default. HTML or MARKDOWN
```
*Note: Make sure to actually replace TOKEN with your own API token.*

After that declaration, we need to register some so-called message handlers. Message handlers define filters which a message must pass. If a message passes the filter, the decorated function is called and the incoming message is passed as an argument.

Let's define a message handler which handles incoming `/start` and `/help` commands.
```python
@bot.message_handler(commands=['start', 'help'])
def send_welcome(message):
	bot.reply_to(message, ""Howdy, how are you doing?"")
```
A function which is decorated by a message handler __can have an arbitrary name, however, it must have only one parameter (the message)__.

Let's add another handler:
```python
@bot.message_handler(func=lambda m: True)
def echo_all(message):
	bot.reply_to(message, message.text)
```
This one echoes all incoming text messages back to the sender. It uses a lambda function to test a message. If the lambda returns True, the message is handled by the decorated function. Since we want all messages to be handled by this function, we simply always return True.

*Note: all handlers are tested in the order in which they were declared*

We now have a basic bot which replies a static message to ""/start"" and ""/help"" commands and which echoes the rest of the sent messages. To start the bot, add the following to our source file:
```python
bot.infinity_polling()
```
Alright, that's it! Our source file now looks like this:
```python
import telebot

bot = telebot.TeleBot(""YOUR_BOT_TOKEN"")

@bot.message_handler(commands=['start', 'help'])
def send_welcome(message):
	bot.reply_to(message, ""Howdy, how are you doing?"")

@bot.message_handler(func=lambda message: True)
def echo_all(message):
	bot.reply_to(message, message.text)

bot.infinity_polling()
```
To start the bot, simply open up a terminal and enter `python echo_bot.py` to run the bot! Test it by sending commands ('/start' and '/help') and arbitrary text messages.

## General API Documentation

### Types

All types are defined in types.py. They are all completely in line with the [Telegram API's definition of the types](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#available-types), except for the Message's `from` field, which is renamed to `from_user` (because `from` is a Python reserved token). Thus, attributes such as `message_id` can be accessed directly with `message.message_id`. Note that `message.chat` can be either an instance of `User` or `GroupChat` (see [How can I distinguish a User and a GroupChat in message.chat?](#how-can-i-distinguish-a-user-and-a-groupchat-in-messagechat)).

The Message object also has a `content_type`attribute, which defines the type of the Message. `content_type` can be one of the following strings:
`text`, `audio`, `document`, `photo`, `sticker`, `video`, `video_note`, `voice`, `location`, `contact`, `new_chat_members`, `left_chat_member`, `new_chat_title`, `new_chat_photo`, `delete_chat_photo`, `group_chat_created`, `supergroup_chat_created`, `channel_chat_created`, `migrate_to_chat_id`, `migrate_from_chat_id`, `pinned_message`.

You can use some types in one function. Example:

```content_types=[""text"", ""sticker"", ""pinned_message"", ""photo"", ""audio""]```

### Methods

All [API methods](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#available-methods) are located in the TeleBot class. They are renamed to follow common Python naming conventions. E.g. `getMe` is renamed to `get_me` and `sendMessage` to `send_message`.

### General use of the API

Outlined below are some general use cases of the API.

#### Message handlers
A message handler is a function that is decorated with the `message_handler` decorator of a TeleBot instance. Message handlers consist of one or multiple filters.
Each filter must return True for a certain message in order for a message handler to become eligible to handle that message. A message handler is declared in the following way (provided `bot` is an instance of TeleBot):
```python
@bot.message_handler(filters)
def function_name(message):
	bot.reply_to(message, ""This is a message handler"")
```
`function_name` is not bound to any restrictions. Any function name is permitted with message handlers. The function must accept at most one argument, which will be the message that the function must handle.
`filters` is a list of keyword arguments.
A filter is declared in the following manner: `name=argument`. One handler may have multiple filters.
TeleBot supports the following filters:

|name|argument(s)|Condition|
|:---:|---| ---|
|content_types|list of strings (default `['text']`)|`True` if message.content_type is in the list of strings.|
|regexp|a regular expression as a string|`True` if `re.search(regexp_arg)` returns `True` and `message.content_type == 'text'` (See [Python Regular Expressions](https://docs.python.org/2/library/re.html))|
|commands|list of strings|`True` if `message.content_type == 'text'` and `message.text` starts with a command that is in the list of strings.|
|chat_types|list of chat types|`True` if `message.chat.type` in your filter|
|func|a function (lambda or function reference)|`True` if the lambda or function reference returns `True`|
	
Here are some examples of using the filters and message handlers:

```python
import telebot
bot = telebot.TeleBot(""TOKEN"")

# Handles all text messages that contains the commands '/start' or '/help'.
@bot.message_handler(commands=['start', 'help'])
def handle_start_help(message):
	pass

# Handles all sent documents and audio files
@bot.message_handler(content_types=['document', 'audio'])
def handle_docs_audio(message):
	pass

# Handles all text messages that match the regular expression
@bot.message_handler(regexp=""SOME_REGEXP"")
def handle_message(message):
	pass

# Handles all messages for which the lambda returns True
@bot.message_handler(func=lambda message: message.document.mime_type == 'text/plain', content_types=['document'])
def handle_text_doc(message):
	pass

# Which could also be defined as:
def test_message(message):
	return message.document.mime_type == 'text/plain'

@bot.message_handler(func=test_message, content_types=['document'])
def handle_text_doc(message):
	pass

# Handlers can be stacked to create a function which will be called if either message_handler is eligible
# This handler will be called if the message starts with '/hello' OR is some emoji
@bot.message_handler(commands=['hello'])
@bot.message_handler(func=lambda msg: msg.text.encode(""utf-8"") == SOME_FANCY_EMOJI)
def send_something(message):
    pass
```
**Important: all handlers are tested in the order in which they were declared**

#### Edited Message handler
Handle edited messages
`@bot.edited_message_handler(filters) # <- passes a Message type object to your function`

#### Channel Post handler
Handle channel post messages
`@bot.channel_post_handler(filters) # <- passes a Message type object to your function`

#### Edited Channel Post handler
Handle edited channel post messages
`@bot.edited_channel_post_handler(filters) # <- passes a Message type object to your function`

#### Callback Query Handler
Handle callback queries
```python
@bot.callback_query_handler(func=lambda call: True)
def test_callback(call): # <- passes a CallbackQuery type object to your function
    logger.info(call)
```

#### Shipping Query Handler
Handle shipping queries
`@bot.shipping_query_handeler() # <- passes a ShippingQuery type object to your function`

#### Pre Checkout Query Handler
Handle pre checkoupt queries
`@bot.pre_checkout_query_handler() # <- passes a PreCheckoutQuery type object to your function`

#### Poll Handler
Handle poll updates
`@bot.poll_handler() # <- passes a Poll type object to your function`

#### Poll Answer Handler
Handle poll answers
`@bot.poll_answer_handler() # <- passes a PollAnswer type object to your function`

#### My Chat Member Handler
Handle updates of a the bot's member status in a chat
`@bot.my_chat_member_handler() # <- passes a ChatMemberUpdated type object to your function`

#### Chat Member Handler
Handle updates of a chat member's status in a chat
`@bot.chat_member_handler() # <- passes a ChatMemberUpdated type object to your function`
*Note: ""chat_member"" updates are not requested by default. If you want to allow all update types, set `allowed_updates` in `bot.polling()` / `bot.infinity_polling()` to `util.update_types`*

#### Chat Join Request Handler	
Handle chat join requests using:
`@bot.chat_join_request_handler() # <- passes ChatInviteLink type object to your function`

### Inline Mode

More information about [Inline mode](https://core.telegram.org/bots/inline).

#### Inline handler

Now, you can use inline_handler to get inline queries in telebot.

```python

@bot.inline_handler(lambda query: query.query == 'text')
def query_text(inline_query):
    # Query message is text
```

#### Chosen Inline handler

Use chosen_inline_handler to get chosen_inline_result in telebot. Don't forgot add the /setinlinefeedback
command for @Botfather.

More information : [collecting-feedback](https://core.telegram.org/bots/inline#collecting-feedback)

```python
@bot.chosen_inline_handler(func=lambda chosen_inline_result: True)
def test_chosen(chosen_inline_result):
    # Process all chosen_inline_result.
```

#### Answer Inline Query

```python
@bot.inline_handler(lambda query: query.query == 'text')
def query_text(inline_query):
    try:
        r = types.InlineQueryResultArticle('1', 'Result', types.InputTextMessageContent('Result message.'))
        r2 = types.InlineQueryResultArticle('2', 'Result2', types.InputTextMessageContent('Result message2.'))
        bot.answer_inline_query(inline_query.id, [r, r2])
    except Exception as e:
        print(e)

```

### Additional API features

#### Middleware Handlers

A middleware handler is a function that allows you to modify requests or the bot context as they pass through the 
Telegram to the bot. You can imagine middleware as a chain of logic connection handled before any other handlers are
executed. Middleware processing is disabled by default, enable it by setting `apihelper.ENABLE_MIDDLEWARE = True`. 

```python
apihelper.ENABLE_MIDDLEWARE = True

@bot.middleware_handler(update_types=['message'])
def modify_message(bot_instance, message):
    # modifying the message before it reaches any other handler 
    message.another_text = message.text + ':changed'

@bot.message_handler(commands=['start'])
def start(message):
    # the message is already modified when it reaches message handler
    assert message.another_text == message.text + ':changed'
```
There are other examples using middleware handler in the [examples/middleware](examples/middleware) directory.
	
	
#### Custom filters
Also, you can use built-in custom filters. Or, you can create your own filter.	

[Example of custom filter](https://github.com/eternnoir/pyTelegramBotAPI/blob/master/examples/custom_filters/general_custom_filters.py)
	
Also, we have examples on them. Check this links:
	
You can check some built-in filters in source [code](https://github.com/eternnoir/pyTelegramBotAPI/blob/master/telebot/custom_filters.py)
	
Example of [filtering by id](https://github.com/eternnoir/pyTelegramBotAPI/blob/master/examples/custom_filters/id_filter_example.py)
	
Example of [filtering by text](https://github.com/eternnoir/pyTelegramBotAPI/blob/master/examples/custom_filters/text_filter_example.py)
	
If you want to add some built-in filter, you are welcome to add it in custom_filters.py file.
	
Here is example of creating filter-class:
	
```python
class IsAdmin(telebot.custom_filters.SimpleCustomFilter):
    # Class will check whether the user is admin or creator in group or not
    key='is_admin'
    @staticmethod
    def check(message: telebot.types.Message):
        return bot.get_chat_member(message.chat.id,message.from_user.id).status in ['administrator','creator']
	
# To register filter, you need to use method add_custom_filter.
bot.add_custom_filter(IsAdmin())
	
# Now, you can use it in handler.
@bot.message_handler(is_admin=True)
def admin_of_group(message):
	bot.send_message(message.chat.id, 'You are admin of this group!')

```
	

#### TeleBot
```python
import telebot

TOKEN = '<token_string>'
tb = telebot.TeleBot(TOKEN)	#create a new Telegram Bot object

# Upon calling this function, TeleBot starts polling the Telegram servers for new messages.
# - interval: int (default 0) - The interval between polling requests
# - timeout: integer (default 20) - Timeout in seconds for long polling.
# - allowed_updates: List of Strings (default None) - List of update types to request 
tb.infinity_polling(interval=0, timeout=20)

# getMe
user = tb.get_me()

# setWebhook
tb.set_webhook(url=""http://example.com"", certificate=open('mycert.pem'))
# unset webhook
tb.remove_webhook()

# getUpdates
updates = tb.get_updates()
# or
updates = tb.get_updates(1234,100,20) #get_Updates(offset, limit, timeout):

# sendMessage
tb.send_message(chat_id, text)

# editMessageText
tb.edit_message_text(new_text, chat_id, message_id)

# forwardMessage
tb.forward_message(to_chat_id, from_chat_id, message_id)

# All send_xyz functions which can take a file as an argument, can also take a file_id instead of a file.
# sendPhoto
photo = open('/tmp/photo.png', 'rb')
tb.send_photo(chat_id, photo)
tb.send_photo(chat_id, ""FILEID"")

# sendAudio
audio = open('/tmp/audio.mp3', 'rb')
tb.send_audio(chat_id, audio)
tb.send_audio(chat_id, ""FILEID"")

## sendAudio with duration, performer and title.
tb.send_audio(CHAT_ID, file_data, 1, 'eternnoir', 'pyTelegram')

# sendVoice
voice = open('/tmp/voice.ogg', 'rb')
tb.send_voice(chat_id, voice)
tb.send_voice(chat_id, ""FILEID"")

# sendDocument
doc = open('/tmp/file.txt', 'rb')
tb.send_document(chat_id, doc)
tb.send_document(chat_id, ""FILEID"")

# sendSticker
sti = open('/tmp/sti.webp', 'rb')
tb.send_sticker(chat_id, sti)
tb.send_sticker(chat_id, ""FILEID"")

# sendVideo
video = open('/tmp/video.mp4', 'rb')
tb.send_video(chat_id, video)
tb.send_video(chat_id, ""FILEID"")

# sendVideoNote
videonote = open('/tmp/videonote.mp4', 'rb')
tb.send_video_note(chat_id, videonote)
tb.send_video_note(chat_id, ""FILEID"")

# sendLocation
tb.send_location(chat_id, lat, lon)

# sendChatAction
# action_string can be one of the following strings: 'typing', 'upload_photo', 'record_video', 'upload_video',
# 'record_audio', 'upload_audio', 'upload_document' or 'find_location'.
tb.send_chat_action(chat_id, action_string)

# getFile
# Downloading a file is straightforward
# Returns a File object
import requests
file_info = tb.get_file(file_id)

file = requests.get('https://api.telegram.org/file/bot{0}/{1}'.format(API_TOKEN, file_info.file_path))


```
#### Reply markup
All `send_xyz` functions of TeleBot take an optional `reply_markup` argument. This argument must be an instance of `ReplyKeyboardMarkup`, `ReplyKeyboardRemove` or `ForceReply`, which are defined in types.py.

```python
from telebot import types

# Using the ReplyKeyboardMarkup class
# It's constructor can take the following optional arguments:
# - resize_keyboard: True/False (default False)
# - one_time_keyboard: True/False (default False)
# - selective: True/False (default False)
# - row_width: integer (default 3)
# row_width is used in combination with the add() function.
# It defines how many buttons are fit on each row before continuing on the next row.
markup = types.ReplyKeyboardMarkup(row_width=2)
itembtn1 = types.KeyboardButton('a')
itembtn2 = types.KeyboardButton('v')
itembtn3 = types.KeyboardButton('d')
markup.add(itembtn1, itembtn2, itembtn3)
tb.send_message(chat_id, ""Choose one letter:"", reply_markup=markup)

# or add KeyboardButton one row at a time:
markup = types.ReplyKeyboardMarkup()
itembtna = types.KeyboardButton('a')
itembtnv = types.KeyboardButton('v')
itembtnc = types.KeyboardButton('c')
itembtnd = types.KeyboardButton('d')
itembtne = types.KeyboardButton('e')
markup.row(itembtna, itembtnv)
markup.row(itembtnc, itembtnd, itembtne)
tb.send_message(chat_id, ""Choose one letter:"", reply_markup=markup)
```
The last example yields this result:

![ReplyKeyboardMarkup](https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2933/32418726704_9ef76093cf_o_d.jpg ""ReplyKeyboardMarkup"")

```python
# ReplyKeyboardRemove: hides a previously sent ReplyKeyboardMarkup
# Takes an optional selective argument (True/False, default False)
markup = types.ReplyKeyboardRemove(selective=False)
tb.send_message(chat_id, message, reply_markup=markup)
```

```python
# ForceReply: forces a user to reply to a message
# Takes an optional selective argument (True/False, default False)
markup = types.ForceReply(selective=False)
tb.send_message(chat_id, ""Send me another word:"", reply_markup=markup)
```
ForceReply:

![ForceReply](https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3809/32418726814_d1baec0fc2_o_d.jpg ""ForceReply"")


### Working with entities
This object represents one special entity in a text message. For example, hashtags, usernames, URLs, etc.
Attributes:
* `type`
* `url`
* `offset`
* `length`
* `user`


**Here's an Example:**`message.entities[num].<attribute>`<br>
Here `num` is the entity number or order of entity in a reply, for if incase there are multiple entities in the reply/message.<br>
`message.entities` returns a list of entities object. <br>
`message.entities[0].type` would give the type of the first entity<br>
Refer [Bot Api](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#messageentity) for extra details

## Advanced use of the API

### Using local Bot API Sever
Since version 5.0 of the Bot API, you have the possibility to run your own [Local Bot API Server](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#using-a-local-bot-api-server).
pyTelegramBotAPI also supports this feature.
```python
from telebot import apihelper

apihelper.API_URL = ""http://localhost:4200/bot{0}/{1}""
```
**Important: Like described [here](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#logout), you have to log out your bot from the Telegram server before switching to your local API server. in pyTelegramBotAPI use `bot.log_out()`**

*Note: 4200 is an example port*

### Asynchronous TeleBot
New: There is an asynchronous implementation of telebot.
To enable this behaviour, create an instance of AsyncTeleBot instead of TeleBot.
```python
tb = telebot.AsyncTeleBot(""TOKEN"")
```
Now, every function that calls the Telegram API is executed in a separate asynchronous task.
Using AsyncTeleBot allows you to do the following:
```python
import telebot

tb = telebot.AsyncTeleBot(""TOKEN"")

@tb.message_handler(commands=['start'])
async def start_message(message):
	await bot.send_message(message.chat.id, 'Hello!')

```

See more in [examples](https://github.com/eternnoir/pyTelegramBotAPI/tree/master/examples/asynchronous_telebot)

### Sending large text messages
Sometimes you must send messages that exceed 5000 characters. The Telegram API can not handle that many characters in one request, so we need to split the message in multiples. Here is how to do that using the API:
```python
from telebot import util
large_text = open(""large_text.txt"", ""rb"").read()

# Split the text each 3000 characters.
# split_string returns a list with the splitted text.
splitted_text = util.split_string(large_text, 3000)

for text in splitted_text:
	tb.send_message(chat_id, text)
```

Or you can use the new `smart_split` function to get more meaningful substrings:
```python
from telebot import util
large_text = open(""large_text.txt"", ""rb"").read()
# Splits one string into multiple strings, with a maximum amount of `chars_per_string` (max. 4096)
# Splits by last '\n', '. ' or ' ' in exactly this priority.
# smart_split returns a list with the splitted text.
splitted_text = util.smart_split(large_text, chars_per_string=3000)
for text in splitted_text:
	tb.send_message(chat_id, text)
```
### Controlling the amount of Threads used by TeleBot
The TeleBot constructor takes the following optional arguments:

 - threaded: True/False (default True). A flag to indicate whether
   TeleBot should execute message handlers on it's polling Thread.

### The listener mechanism
As an alternative to the message handlers, one can also register a function as a listener to TeleBot.

NOTICE: handlers won't disappear! Your message will be processed both by handlers and listeners. Also, it's impossible to predict which will work at first because of threading. If you use threaded=False, custom listeners will work earlier, after them handlers will be called. 
Example:
```python
def handle_messages(messages):
	for message in messages:
		# Do something with the message
		bot.reply_to(message, 'Hi')

bot.set_update_listener(handle_messages)
bot.infinity_polling()
```

### Using web hooks
When using webhooks telegram sends one Update per call, for processing it you should call process_new_messages([update.message]) when you recieve it.

There are some examples using webhooks in the [examples/webhook_examples](examples/webhook_examples) directory.

### Logging
You can use the Telebot module logger to log debug info about Telebot. Use `telebot.logger` to get the logger of the TeleBot module.
It is possible to add custom logging Handlers to the logger. Refer to the [Python logging module page](https://docs.python.org/2/library/logging.html) for more info.

```python
import logging

logger = telebot.logger
telebot.logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG) # Outputs debug messages to console.
```

### Proxy
You can use proxy for request. `apihelper.proxy` object will use by call `requests` proxies argument.

```python
from telebot import apihelper

apihelper.proxy = {'http':'http://127.0.0.1:3128'}
```

If you want to use socket5 proxy you need install dependency `pip install requests[socks]` and make sure, that you have the latest version of `gunicorn`, `PySocks`, `pyTelegramBotAPI`, `requests` and `urllib3`.

```python
apihelper.proxy = {'https':'socks5://userproxy:password@proxy_address:port'}
```

### Testing
You can disable or change the interaction with real Telegram server by using
```python
apihelper.CUSTOM_REQUEST_SENDER = your_handler
```
parameter. You can pass there your own function that will be called instead of _requests.request_.

For example:
```python
def custom_sender(method, url, **kwargs):
    print(""custom_sender. method: {}, url: {}, params: {}"".format(method, url, kwargs.get(""params"")))
    result = util.CustomRequestResponse('{""ok"":true,""result"":{""message_id"": 1, ""date"": 1, ""chat"": {""id"": 1, ""type"": ""private""}}}')
    return result
```

Then you can use API and proceed requests in your handler code.
```python
apihelper.CUSTOM_REQUEST_SENDER = custom_sender
tb = TeleBot(""test"")
res = tb.send_message(123, ""Test"")
```

Result will be:

`custom_sender. method: post, url: https://api.telegram.org/botololo/sendMessage, params: {'chat_id': '123', 'text': 'Test'}`

## AsyncTeleBot
### Asynchronous version of telebot
We have a fully asynchronous version of TeleBot.
This class is not controlled by threads. Asyncio tasks are created to execute all the stuff.

### EchoBot
Echo Bot example on AsyncTeleBot:
	
```python
# This is a simple echo bot using the decorator mechanism.
# It echoes any incoming text messages.

from telebot.async_telebot import AsyncTeleBot
import asyncio
bot = AsyncTeleBot('TOKEN')



# Handle '/start' and '/help'
@bot.message_handler(commands=['help', 'start'])
async def send_welcome(message):
    await bot.reply_to(message, """"""\
Hi there, I am EchoBot.
I am here to echo your kind words back to you. Just say anything nice and I'll say the exact same thing to you!\
"""""")


# Handle all other messages with content_type 'text' (content_types defaults to ['text'])
@bot.message_handler(func=lambda message: True)
async def echo_message(message):
    await bot.reply_to(message, message.text)


asyncio.run(bot.polling())
```
As you can see here, keywords are await and async. 
	
### Why should I use async?
Asynchronous tasks depend on processor performance. Many asynchronous tasks can run parallelly, while thread tasks will block each other.

### Differences in AsyncTeleBot
AsyncTeleBot has different middlewares. See example on [middlewares](https://github.com/coder2020official/pyTelegramBotAPI/tree/master/examples/asynchronous_telebot/middleware)
	
### Examples
See more examples in our [examples](https://github.com/eternnoir/pyTelegramBotAPI/tree/master/examples/asynchronous_telebot) folder
	

## F.A.Q.

### How can I distinguish a User and a GroupChat in message.chat?
Telegram Bot API support new type Chat for message.chat.

- Check the ```type``` attribute in ```Chat``` object:
-
```python
if message.chat.type == ""private"":
    # private chat message

if message.chat.type == ""group"":
	# group chat message

if message.chat.type == ""supergroup"":
	# supergroup chat message

if message.chat.type == ""channel"":
	# channel message

```

### How can I handle reocurring ConnectionResetErrors?

Bot instances that were idle for a long time might be rejected by the server when sending a message due to a timeout of the last used session. Add `apihelper.SESSION_TIME_TO_LIVE = 5 * 60` to your initialisation to force recreation after 5 minutes without any activity.

### [What's new with Bot Framework?](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/what-is-new?view=azure-bot-service-4.0)

Bot Framework provides the most comprehensive experience for building conversation applications.

With the [Bot Framework SDK](#bot-framework-sdk-v4), developers can build bots that converse free-form or with guided interactions including using simple text or rich cards that contain text, images, and action buttons.

Developers can model and build sophisticated conversation using their favorite programming languages including C#, JS, Python and Java or using [Bot Framework Composer](https://aka.ms/bfcomposer), an open-source, visual authoring canvas for developers and multi-disciplinary teams to design and build conversational experiences with Language Understanding, QnA Maker and sophisticated composition of bot replies (Language Generation).

Checkout the [Bot Framework ecosystem](#bot-framework-ecosystem) section to learn more about other tooling and services related to the Bot Framework SDK.

### Botkit
[Botkit][100] is a developer tool and SDK for building chat bots, apps and custom integrations for major messaging platforms. Botkit bots `hear()` triggers, `ask()` questions and `say()` replies. Developers can use this syntax to build dialogs - now cross compatible with the latest version of Bot Framework SDK.

In addition, Botkit brings with it 6 platform adapters allowing Javascript bot applications to communicate directly with messaging platforms: [Slack][102], [Webex Teams][103], [Google Hangouts][104], [Facebook Messenger][105], [Twilio][106], and [Web chat][107].

Botkit is part of Microsoft Bot Framework and is released under the [MIT Open Source license][101]

### Azure Bot Service
Azure Bot Service enables you to host intelligent, enterprise-grade bots with complete ownership and control of your data. Developers can register and connect their bots to users on Skype, Microsoft Teams, Cortana, Web Chat, and more. [[Docs][28]]

* **Direct Line JS Client**: If you want to use the Direct Line channel in Azure Bot Service and are not using the WebChat client, the Direct Line JS client can be used in your custom application. [[Readme][30]]

<a name=""ABS-whats-new""></a>

* **Direct Line Speech Channel**: We are bringing together the Bot Framework and Microsoft's Speech Services to provide a channel that enables streamed speech and text bi-directionally from the client to the bot application.  To sign up, add the 'Direct Line Speech' channel to your Azure Bot Service.

* **Better isolation for your Bot - Direct Line App Service Extension** : The Direct Line App Service Extension can be deployed as part of a VNET, allowing IT administrators to have more control over conversation traffic and improved latency in conversations due to reduction in the number of hops. Get started with Direct Line App Service Extension here. A VNET lets you create your own private space in Azure and is crucial to your cloud network as it offers isolation, segmentation, and other key benefits.

### Bot Framework Emulator
The [Bot Framework Emulator][60] is a  cross-platform desktop application that allows bot developers to test and debug bots built using the Bot Framework SDK. You can use the Bot Framework Emulator to test bots running locally on your machine or to connect to bots running remotely. [[Download latest][61] | [Docs][62]]

## Adding to project ##

### Sdk Version ###
`compileSdkVersion` >= 25

### Importing to project(choose one) ###

#### Example for Gradle: ####

Step 1. Add it in your root build.gradle at the end of repositories:
```groovy
allprojects {
	repositories {
		...
		maven { url ""https://jitpack.io"" }
		maven { url ""https://maven.google.com"" }
	}
}
```

Step 2. Add the dependency
1. old version support lib is 25 or 26
```groovy
compile 'com.github.ittianyu:BottomNavigationViewEx:1.2.4'
compile ""com.android.support:design:26.+""
```
2. new version support lib = 28
```groovy
implementation 'com.github.ittianyu:BottomNavigationViewEx:2.0.4'
implementation ""com.android.support:design:28.0.0""
```
3. AndroidX
use new version，and add config into gradle.properties
```
android.useAndroidX=true
android.enableJetifier=true
```

#### Manual: ####

Downloading [BottomNavigationViewEx.java](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ittianyu/BottomNavigationViewEx/master/widget/src/main/java/com/ittianyu/bottomnavigationviewex/BottomNavigationViewEx.java) and copying it to you project.


## Getting started ##

Adding a custom widget in `xml` :
```xml
<com.ittianyu.bottomnavigationviewex.BottomNavigationViewEx
    android:id=""@+id/bnve""
    android:layout_width=""match_parent""
    android:layout_height=""wrap_content""
    android:layout_alignParentBottom=""true""
    android:background=""@color/colorPrimary""
    app:itemIconTint=""@color/selector_item_color""
    app:itemTextColor=""@color/selector_item_color""
    app:menu=""@menu/menu_navigation_with_view_pager"" />
```

Binding view in `Activity`:
```java
BottomNavigationViewEx bnve = (BottomNavigationViewEx) findViewById(R.id.bnve);
```

#### Disable all animations ####
```java
bnve.enableAnimation(false);
bnve.enableShiftingMode(false);
bnve.enableItemShiftingMode(false);
```

#### Custom text and icon size ####
```java
bnve.setIconSize(widthDp, heightDp);
bnve.setTextSize(sp);
```

#### Binding with ViewPager ####
```java
// set adapter
adapter = new VpAdapter(getSupportFragmentManager(), fragments);
bind.vp.setAdapter(adapter);

// binding with ViewPager
bind.bnve.setupWithViewPager(bind.vp);
```

#### Add badge view ####

1. Add badge lib
	```
	compile 'q.rorbin:badgeview:1.1.0'
	```
2. Bind bottom view
	```
    // add badge
    addBadgeAt(2, 1);

    private Badge addBadgeAt(int position, int number) {
        // add badge
        return new QBadgeView(this)
                .setBadgeNumber(number)
                .setGravityOffset(12, 2, true)
                .bindTarget(bind.bnve.getBottomNavigationItemView(position))
                .setOnDragStateChangedListener(new Badge.OnDragStateChangedListener() {
                    @Override
                    public void onDragStateChanged(int dragState, Badge badge, View targetView) {
                        if (Badge.OnDragStateChangedListener.STATE_SUCCEED == dragState)
                            Toast.makeText(BadgeViewActivity.this, R.string.tips_badge_removed, Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
                    }
                });
    }
	```

#### Other usage in BottomNavigationViewEx ####
You can see the demo.

#### Usage in BottomNavigationView ####
Other usage is the same as official `BottomNavigationView`.
You can [click here](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/design/widget/BottomNavigationView.html) for detail.

## ProGuard ##

If you are using ProGuard you might need to add the following option:

#### None Android X ####
```
-keep public class android.support.design.widget.BottomNavigationView { *; }
-keep public class android.support.design.internal.BottomNavigationMenuView { *; }
-keep public class android.support.design.internal.BottomNavigationPresenter { *; }
-keep public class android.support.design.internal.BottomNavigationItemView { *; }
```

#### Android X ####
```
-keep public class com.google.android.material.bottomnavigation.BottomNavigationView { *; }
-keep public class com.google.android.material.bottomnavigation.BottomNavigationMenuView { *; }
-keep public class com.google.android.material.bottomnavigation.BottomNavigationPresenter { *; }
-keep public class com.google.android.material.bottomnavigation.BottomNavigationItemView { *; }
```

## References ##

The lib is based on `BottomNavigationView` in `Support Library 25 design`.

I found it was inflexible when I tried the demo. For example, I couldn't change the currently checked item through code. So I wrote a class to extend it to provide some useful methods.

You have no need to worry about stability, because I minimised the modifications through reflection.

# Why should I automate my Instagram account?
It's very hard nowadays to grow an account. Have you ever been on the explore page? IG will show your post only to close accounts & accounts you interact most with, you will never be on the explore page. Nobody will see your beautiful photos, your super funny memes, or whatever you are posting. But now you can do something about that! With GramAddict you can __get noticed easily__, and if you really deserve it, your account will __grow super fast__!

## So, do I need to publish good content to grow?
Of course you have to! This bot will mainly help you to get the __visibility you deserve__ and which is Instagram not giving you.

## Ok but I don't know how to start this journey...
Don't worry about that now, it's not that hard to start botting with GramAddict! I tried to make it as noob-friendly as possible. In any case, if you follow the docs with all the steps provided, you will make it! You are also invited to join our community and ask for any help!

## There is a community around this project?
Yes! We are on __discord__ and we count a lot of __active users__ you can ask us whatever you want!

  <a href=""https://discord.gg/NK8PNEFGFF"">
    <img src=""https://img.shields.io/discord/771481743471017994?style=flat"">
  </a>

## I saw there're a lot of similar projects on GitHub, why should I choose this one?
You're right, there're plenty of other bot solutions. Most of them use API requests. However, you will get your account banned if you use API (1-30 days)!
There's also a very similar project to this one, yet it's not free and the dev doesn't care about the community much. They removed few lines from the core and ask you for a subscription plan in order to use those features. Furthermore, you don't even know what's the real code during execution - it's crypted. And if they are stealing something else? Who knows? I don't.
This bot is __free to use__ and __open source__, you won't get charged for few extra lines, __EVER__.
I'm focused on the community and not on finding ways how to get money out of this project. __I really care about the community__ and every dev should too. 🤗

## So this bot does not use API?
__No__ this bot is working through __adb__ and is powered by __uiautomator2__ which is a testing wrapper for Android devices. In fact, your device (or an emulator) is used for doing the botting sh*it. That's very secure compared to other botting systems around there. I also made it look as much human as possible. You can think about the bot as a __stupid__ friend using your phone and doing things for you. The example bottom is quite old but will show you what we are talking about.
<p align=""center"">
  <img src=""https://github.com/GramAddict/bot/raw/master/res/demo.gif"">
</p>

## Urra! I'll never get banned anymore with this bot!
No no no, wait! 🤦
You have to configure the bot for doing things as a human would do. Do you really spend all the day scrolling on Instagram? If yes contact a medic :P
You don't have to do so many actions or Instagram will block you. That appends even if you do that by your hands.. Have you ever added a lot of people in a row and got blocked for that action? Or spamming people with a link in PM? 
__DON'T F*CKING DO THAT__

__Be gently and anonymous and nobody will notice that you're botting, trust me__.

## Do I need a computer for running the bot?
Yes, but you can also run it [directly on your phone](https://docs.gramaddict.org/#/termux)!!

In any case, you can decide to use a physical device or an emulator (if you're under Windows I suggest you use [Memu](https://www.memuplay.com/)).
For hosting the bot you can use:
- your computer (with Windows, macOS, or Linux)
- a Raspberry (which is a cheap little pc Linux based)

## Cool! What can I do with this bot? 
There are lots of __cool features__ you can use __for free__!
- Works without rooting
- Works with both emulators and physical devices
- Can be used stand-alone (without the use of a computer)
- Includes realistic random human-like delays and actions
- Can watch stories while interacting
- Comment post with emojis and [spintax logic](https://github.com/GramAddict/docs/blob/main/configuration.md#spintax-support)

    ... and more!
<br />

Full documentation available on [docs.gramaddict.org](https://docs.gramaddict.org)

## Telegram reports? What's that?
You can get __reports__ through telegram from your bot activities!
[Follow this guide to accomplish that](https://docs.gramaddict.org/#/configuration?id=telegram-reports).

<img src=""https://github.com/GramAddict/bot/raw/master/res/telegram-reports.png"" width=""200"">

> In this case trends are negative because I use this account only for tuning this bot and it's private...
> I didn't accept anyone lately so the trends are meh :P

Cool, isn't it? 💦
# Quick start
Now that you're there you still don't know how to install that whole thing.
I'll try to help you accomplish that with a short tutorial. The full is available [here](https://docs.gramaddict.org/#/quickstart).

## What do you need:
- a computer (with Windows, macOS or Linux)
- Python installed on your machine (with pip)
- Adb tools
- a physical device or an emulator (with Android 4.4+)
### Step 1: Install Python (>=3.6):
>Python 3.10 is currently not supported!

If you're on Linux or macOS you should have Python and Git installed, just check that your Python version is >= 3.6.

On windows you have to [install it](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-397/) for sure.

Failed? [Detailed tutorial here](https://docs.gramaddict.org/#/quickstart?id=step-1-install-python-if-not-installed).
>A little reminder: we refer to python with __python3__. You may have also have python2 installed if you're on Linux for example. If you're on Windows you can use __python__ instead of python3.
>Check which python alias you have to use by typing `python -V` or `python3 -V` or `py -V` and use the right one for the rest of the tutorial.

>Check that pip3 is installed by typing `pip3 -V`
>If that returns an error you have to install it! How? [Google is your best friend!](https://www.google.com/search?q=how+to+install+pip) :P
### Step 2: Install GramAddict:
You can install GramAddict in two ways: with __pip__ or with __git__.
Is good practice to create virtual environments when you install a new package. That will save you from a lot of problems!

#### Create a virtual environment
We create a virtual environment called `.venv` and activate it:

- create a directory where you will create the new environment
- write in console: `python3 -m venv .venv`
  > We use `venv` instead of `virtualenv` because `venv` is shipped directly with python3 and you don't have to install anything 🤪
- activate the .venv:
    - `source .venv/bin/activate` on Linux/macOS
    - `.venv\Scripts\activate.bat` on Windows cmd
    - `.venv\Scripts\activate.ps1` on Windows PowerShell
      > If you activate the venv correctly, you will see a little (.venv) on the left side of the command line!
#### With pip (I suggest you this way):

- install the package: `pip3 install GramAddict`
- check if it's installed: `gramaddict --version`
- if everything is fine you will get the GramAddict version installed 🥳

#### With git:
> __Warning:__ console commands like `gramaddict init`, `gramaddict dump` and `gramaddict run` won't work if you installed the bot with git.
- clone the project: `git clone https://github.com/GramAddict/bot.git gramaddict`
- enter the gramaddict folder: `cd gramaddict`
- install the requirements: `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

### Step 3: Install adb:
Adb stands for [Android Debug Bridge](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb). It's needed for making this bot working properly. I think this one is the hardest part to accomplish but don't give up! You can do it, with my help. 💪
1. download [this package](https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools) and unzip it somewhere and remind the path
   > __Warning:__ place that where you're sure you won't ever delete it, otherwise the bot won't work anymore!
2. add platform-tools path to the PATH environment variable
   - if you're on __Linux/macOS__ that's pretty easy:
      - open ~/.bash_profile with any text editor you like
      - add the following line with the full path to the platform-tools directory: export PATH=~/Library/Android/sdk/platform-tools/:$PATH. This path may be different depending on the way you installed platform-tools
      - save file and restart Terminal
   - on __Windows__ there are more steps to accomplish that:
      - open Windows Explorer (you can press WINKEY+E) and right-click ""My Computer"" on left side
      - in the pop-up menu, click `Properties`
      - in the `System Properties` window, click the `Advanced` tab, and then click `Environment Variables`
      - in the `System Variables` window, highlight `Path`, and click `Edit`
      - in the `Edit System Variables` window, press on `New`
      - enter the full path for the folder platform-tools you unzipped before
      - press all the Ok and restart Command Prompt
3. check that everything is fine
   - write `adb version`, you should get something like that:
      > C:\Users\dedil>adb version
      > Android Debug Bridge version 1.0.41
      > Version 30.0.5-6877874

### Step 4: Start the bot:
This bot works only if your Instagram is in [English](https://help.instagram.com/111923612310997).
1. First thing you have to do is to [enable developer options and USB debugging](https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/dev-options#enable).
2. connect your phone to your computer with an USB cable
3. device will ask you to allow connection. Press ""Connect""
4. type `adb devices` in terminal
   - a list of devices attached should be displayed, if not you did something wrong
      > List of devices attached
      > A0B1CD2345678901    device

   - this is your device ID, you have to use it only if you have more then one device connected at the same time
5. initialize uiautomator2: `uiautomator2 init`
6. initialize GramAddict: `gramaddict init your_ig_account_name_here`
    > __Warning:__ works only if you installed the bot with pip, if you used git you have to create account folder and youraccountname folder manually.
    - that script will crate all the files you need for configure and start this bot
    - you will find them inside the folder `accounts/youraccountname/`
      ```sh
        gramaddict/
          run.py
          accounts/
            youraccountname/
              config.yml
              telegram.yml
              filters.yml
              whitelist.txt
              blacklist.txt
              comments_list.txt
              pm_list.txt
      ```
7. now that you have all the requirements you have to configure the whole thing by [following this guide](https://docs.gramaddict.org/#/configuration)
8. now you're done and you can finally start the bot: `python3 run.py --config accounts/yourusername/config.yml` or `gramaddict run --config accounts/yourusername/config.yml`

Failed? [Check this out!](https://docs.gramaddict.org/#/quickstart?id=troubleshooting)

# Bot crashes, what should I do?
The script isn't perfect and may fail sometimes. If this is the case you can open a ticket on our [discord channel](https://discord.gg/NK8PNEFGFF). In that way you won't share with anyone your Instagram account name 😈. We'll be very happy to help you!

# WOW! You dedicated so much time to this project! Why you did that for free??
Well, we used to be in three a long time ago but suddenly my two friends left. This has been an opportunity for me to improve my skills in Python and that's why I didn't leave the project and keep maintaining it.
But of course donations are very welcome, so if you think I did a great job you can buy me a beer :)

29,29,soarcn/BottomSheet,Java,"BottomSheet
=======
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/soarcn/BottomSheet.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/soarcn/BottomSheet) [![Android Arsenal](https://img.shields.io/badge/Android%20Arsenal-BottomSheet-brightgreen.svg?style=flat)](https://android-arsenal.com/details/1/1044)

**_Google introduced official bottomsheets implementation in Support library 23.2.0,thus this library is no longer activly being developed. I will continuely fix defects been found and accept good PR but No more new feature will be developed. Thanks for your support!_**

One way to present a set of actions to a user is with bottom sheets, a sheet of paper that slides up from the bottom edge of the screen. Bottom sheets offer flexibility in the display of clear and simple actions that do not need explanation.

https://www.google.com/design/spec/components/bottom-sheets.html

This library works on android api 14+

![Sample](https://github.com/soarcn/BottomSheet/blob/master/art/image.png?raw=true)
![Sample](https://github.com/soarcn/BottomSheet/blob/master/art/image1.png?raw=true)

![Sample](https://github.com/soarcn/BottomSheet/blob/master/art/image5.png?raw=true)

How to use this library
=======

- Download this library, import to your IDE (eclipse...) as a library project.
- Using Gradle

```groovy
    compile 'com.cocosw:bottomsheet:1.+@aar'
```
- Using Maven

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.cocosw</groupId>
    <artifactId>bottomsheet</artifactId>
    <version>1.x</version>
    <type>apklib</type>
</dependency>
```

- Version
if you use Android support library - 1.4.0
if you use Androidx - 1.5.0

API
=======

- Define actions in menu xml (Tip: divider tag has been replaced by group tag from 1.1.0)

```xml
<menu xmlns:android=""http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"">
    <item android:id=""@+id/share"" android:title=""@string/share"" android:icon=""@drawable/perm_group_messages""/>
    <item android:id=""@+id/upload"" android:title=""@string/upload"" android:icon=""@drawable/perm_group_system_clock""/>
    <item android:id=""@+id/call"" android:title=""@string/call"" android:icon=""@drawable/perm_group_phone_calls""/>
    <group android:id=""@+id/helpgroup"">
         <item android:id=""@+id/help"" android:title=""@string/help"" android:icon=""@drawable/perm_group_system_tools""/>
    </group>
</menu>

```

- Show it just like showing a dialog.

```java
new BottomSheet.Builder(this).title(""title"").sheet(R.menu.list).listener(new DialogInterface.OnClickListener() {
                    @Override
                    public void onClick(DialogInterface dialog, int which) {
                        switch (which) {
                            case R.id.help:
                                q.toast(""Help me!"");
                                break;
                        }
                    }
                }).show();

```
- You can also add action items in builder.

Action items manipulate
========

You can get a menu object from bottomsheet instance from 1.1.0, and change it as you want, exactly like you're manipulating an android menu or actionbar actionitems.
Please be aware that if you change the menu after showing the bottomsheet, you must call invalidate(), or no changes will be applied and your app might crash.
Please check example application for more info.


Style
========

- Invoke darkTheme() to show the built-in dark theme
- Or define your style in your application, and call bottomsheet by using new BottomSheet.Builder(this,R.style.BottomSheet_StyleDialog)....

```xml
    <style name=""BottomSheet.StyleDialog"" parent=""BottomSheet.Dialog"">
        <item name=""android:backgroundDimAmount"">0.5</item>
        <item name=""android:windowAnimationStyle"">@style/BottomSheet.Animation</item>
        <item name=""android:textColorPrimary"">#DDffffff</item>
        <item name=""android:textColorSecondary"">#8Affffff</item>
        <item name=""android:textColorHint"">#42ffffff</item>
        <item name=""bs_dialogBackground"">@color/abc_search_url_text_normal</item>
        <item name=""bs_dividerColor"">@color/abc_search_url_text_pressed</item>

# Bot Framework Emulator

[![Build Status](https://fuselabs.visualstudio.com/BotFramework-Emulator/_apis/build/status/%5BV4-Nightly%5D-Main-Build?branchName=main)](https://fuselabs.visualstudio.com/BotFramework-Emulator/_build/latest?definitionId=419&branchName=main) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/Microsoft/BotFramework-Emulator/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://coveralls.io/github/Microsoft/BotFramework-Emulator?branch=main)

The Bot Framework Emulator is a desktop application that allows bot developers to test and debug bots built using the [Bot Framework SDK](https://github.com/microsoft/botbuilder). You can use the Bot Framework Emulator to test bots running either locally on your machine or connect to bots running remotely through a tunnel.

This repo is part the [Microsoft Bot Framework](https://github.com/microsoft/botframework-sdk) - a comprehensive framework for building enterprise-grade conversational AI experiences.

## Download

* Download the Bot Framework V4 Emulator for your platform from the [GitHub releases](https://github.com/Microsoft/BotFramework-Emulator/releases/latest) page.

### Supported platforms

* Windows
* OS X

This code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/php-telegram-bot/core). Pull requests are welcome.

## Instructions

### Create your first bot

1. Message [`@BotFather`](https://telegram.me/BotFather) with the following text: `/newbot`

   If you don't know how to message by username, click the search field on your Telegram app and type `@BotFather`, where you should be able to initiate a conversation. Be careful not to send it to the wrong contact, because some users have similar usernames to `BotFather`.

   ![BotFather initial conversation](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9423417/60736229-bc2aeb80-9f45-11e9-8d35-5b53145347bc.png)

2. `@BotFather` replies with:

    ```
    Alright, a new bot. How are we going to call it? Please choose a name for your bot.
    ```

3. Type whatever name you want for your bot.

4. `@BotFather` replies with:

    ```
    Good. Now let's choose a username for your bot. It must end in `bot`. Like this, for example: TetrisBot or tetris_bot.
    ```

5. Type whatever username you want for your bot, minimum 5 characters, and must end with `bot`. For example: `telesample_bot`

6. `@BotFather` replies with:

    ```
    Done! Congratulations on your new bot. You will find it at
    telegram.me/telesample_bot. You can now add a description, about
    section and profile picture for your bot, see /help for a list of
    commands.

    Use this token to access the HTTP API:
    123456789:AAG90e14-0f8-40183D-18491dDE

    For a description of the Bot API, see this page:
    https://core.telegram.org/bots/api
    ```

7. Note down the 'token' mentioned above.

*Optionally set the bot privacy:*

1. Send `/setprivacy` to `@BotFather`.

   ![BotFather later conversation](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9423417/60736340-26439080-9f46-11e9-970f-8f33bbe39c5f.png)

2. `@BotFather` replies with:

    ```
    Choose a bot to change group messages settings.
    ```

3. Type (or select) `@telesample_bot` (change to the username you set at step 5
above, but start it with `@`)

4. `@BotFather` replies with:

    ```
    'Enable' - your bot will only receive messages that either start with the '/' symbol or mention the bot by username.
    'Disable' - your bot will receive all messages that people send to groups.
    Current status is: ENABLED
    ```

5. Type (or select) `Disable` to let your bot receive all messages sent to a group.

6. `@BotFather` replies with:

    ```
    Success! The new status is: DISABLED. /help
    ```

### Require this package with Composer

Install this package through [Composer].
Edit your project's `composer.json` file to require `longman/telegram-bot`.

Create *composer.json* file
```json
{
    ""name"": ""yourproject/yourproject"",
    ""type"": ""project"",
    ""require"": {
        ""php"": "">=7.3"",
        ""longman/telegram-bot"": ""*""
    }
}
```
and run `composer update`

**or**

run this command in your command line:

```bash
composer require longman/telegram-bot
```

### Choose how to retrieve Telegram updates

The bot can handle updates with [**Webhook**](#webhook-installation) or [**getUpdates**](#getupdates-installation) method:

|      | Webhook | getUpdates |
| ---- | :----: | :----: |
| Description | Telegram sends the updates directly to your host | You have to fetch Telegram updates manually |
| Host with https | Required | Not required |
| MySQL | Not required | ([Not](#getupdates-without-database)) Required  |

## Using a custom Bot API server

**For advanced users only!**

As from Telegram Bot API 5.0, users can [run their own Bot API server] to handle updates.
This means, that the PHP Telegram Bot needs to be configured to serve that custom URI.
Additionally, you can define the URI where uploaded files to the bot can be downloaded (note the `{API_KEY}` placeholder).

```php
Longman\TelegramBot\Request::setCustomBotApiUri(
    $api_base_uri          = 'https://your-bot-api-server', // Default: https://api.telegram.org
    $api_base_download_uri = '/path/to/files/{API_KEY}'     // Default: /file/bot{API_KEY}
);
```

**Note:** If you are running your bot in `--local` mode, you won't need the `Request::downloadFile()` method, since you can then access your files directly from the absolute path returned by `Request::getFile()`.

## Webhook installation

Note: For a more detailed explanation, head over to the [example-bot repository] and follow the instructions there.

In order to set a [Webhook][api-setwebhook] you need a server with HTTPS and composer support.
(For a [self signed certificate](#self-signed-certificate) you need to add some extra code)

Create *[set.php]* with the following contents:
```php
<?php
// Load composer
require __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';

$bot_api_key  = 'your:bot_api_key';
$bot_username = 'username_bot';
$hook_url     = 'https://your-domain/path/to/hook.php';

try {
    // Create Telegram API object
    $telegram = new Longman\TelegramBot\Telegram($bot_api_key, $bot_username);

    // Set webhook
    $result = $telegram->setWebhook($hook_url);
    if ($result->isOk()) {
        echo $result->getDescription();
    }
} catch (Longman\TelegramBot\Exception\TelegramException $e) {
    // log telegram errors
    // echo $e->getMessage();
}
```

Open your *set.php* via the browser to register the webhook with Telegram.
You should see `Webhook was set`.

Now, create *[hook.php]* with the following contents:
```php
<?php
// Load composer
require __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';

$bot_api_key  = 'your:bot_api_key';
$bot_username = 'username_bot';

try {
    // Create Telegram API object
    $telegram = new Longman\TelegramBot\Telegram($bot_api_key, $bot_username);

    // Handle telegram webhook request
    $telegram->handle();
} catch (Longman\TelegramBot\Exception\TelegramException $e) {
    // Silence is golden!
    // log telegram errors
    // echo $e->getMessage();
}
```

### Self Signed Certificate

Upload the certificate and add the path as a parameter in *set.php*:
```php
$result = $telegram->setWebhook($hook_url, ['certificate' => '/path/to/certificate']);
```

### Unset Webhook

Edit *[unset.php]* with your bot credentials and execute it.

## getUpdates installation

For best performance, the MySQL database should be enabled for the `getUpdates` method!

Create *[getUpdatesCLI.php]* with the following contents:
```php
#!/usr/bin/env php
<?php
require __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';

$bot_api_key  = 'your:bot_api_key';
$bot_username = 'username_bot';

$mysql_credentials = [
   'host'     => 'localhost',
   'port'     => 3306, // optional
   'user'     => 'dbuser',
   'password' => 'dbpass',
   'database' => 'dbname',
];

try {
    // Create Telegram API object
    $telegram = new Longman\TelegramBot\Telegram($bot_api_key, $bot_username);

    // Enable MySQL
    $telegram->enableMySql($mysql_credentials);

    // Handle telegram getUpdates request
    $telegram->handleGetUpdates();
} catch (Longman\TelegramBot\Exception\TelegramException $e) {
    // log telegram errors
    // echo $e->getMessage();
}
```

Next, give the file permission to execute:
```bash
$ chmod +x getUpdatesCLI.php
```

Lastly, run it!
```bash
$ ./getUpdatesCLI.php
```

### getUpdates without database

If you choose to / or are obliged to use the `getUpdates` method without a database, you can replace the `$telegram->useMySQL(...);` line above with:
```php
$telegram->useGetUpdatesWithoutDatabase();
```

## Filter Update

:exclamation: Note that by default, Telegram will send any new update types that may be added in the future. This may cause commands that don't take this into account to break!

It is suggested that you specifically define which update types your bot can receive and handle correctly.

You can define which update types are sent to your bot by defining them when setting the [webhook](#webhook-installation) or passing an array of allowed types when using [getUpdates](#getupdates-installation).

```php
use Longman\TelegramBot\Entities\Update;

// For all update types currently implemented in this library:
// $allowed_updates = Update::getUpdateTypes();

// Define the list of allowed Update types manually:
$allowed_updates = [
    Update::TYPE_MESSAGE,
    Update::TYPE_CHANNEL_POST,
    // etc.
];

// When setting the webhook.
$telegram->setWebhook($hook_url, ['allowed_updates' => $allowed_updates]);

// When handling the getUpdates method.
$telegram->handleGetUpdates(['allowed_updates' => $allowed_updates]);
```

Alternatively, Update processing can be allowed or denied by defining a custom update filter.

Let's say we only want to allow messages from a user with ID `428`, we can do the following before handling the request:

```php
$telegram->setUpdateFilter(function (Update $update, Telegram $telegram, &$reason = 'Update denied by update_filter') {
    $user_id = $update->getMessage()->getFrom()->getId();
    if ($user_id === 428) {
        return true;
    }

    $reason = ""Invalid user with ID {$user_id}"";
    return false;
});
```

The reason for denying an update can be defined with the `$reason` parameter. This text gets written to the debug log.

## Support

### Types

All types are implemented according to Telegram API 5.5 (December 2021).

### Inline Query

Full support for inline query according to Telegram API 5.5 (December 2021).

### Methods

All methods are implemented according to Telegram API 5.5 (December 2021).

#### Send Message

Messages longer than 4096 characters are split up into multiple messages.

```php
$result = Request::sendMessage([
    'chat_id' => $chat_id,
    'text'    => 'Your utf8 text 😜 ...',
]);
```

#### Send Photo

To send a local photo, add it properly to the `$data` parameter using the file path:

```php
$result = Request::sendPhoto([
    'chat_id' => $chat_id,
    'photo'   => Request::encodeFile('/path/to/pic.jpg'),
]);
```

If you know the `file_id` of a previously uploaded file, just use it directly in the data array:

```php
$result = Request::sendPhoto([
    'chat_id' => $chat_id,
    'photo'   => 'AAQCCBNtIhAoAAss4tLEZ3x6HzqVAAqC',
]);
```

To send a remote photo, use the direct URL instead:

```php
$result = Request::sendPhoto([
    'chat_id' => $chat_id,
    'photo'   => 'https://example.com/path/to/pic.jpg',
]);
```

*sendAudio*, *sendDocument*, *sendAnimation*, *sendSticker*, *sendVideo*, *sendVoice* and *sendVideoNote* all work in the same way, just check the [API documentation](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#sendphoto) for the exact usage.
See the *[ImageCommand.php]* for a full example.

#### Send Chat Action

```php
Request::sendChatAction([
    'chat_id' => $chat_id,
    'action'  => Longman\TelegramBot\ChatAction::TYPING,
]);
```

#### getUserProfilePhoto

Retrieve the user photo. (see *[WhoamiCommand.php]* for a full example)

#### getFile and downloadFile

Get the file path and download it. (see *[WhoamiCommand.php]* for a full example)

#### Send message to all active chats

To do this you have to enable the MySQL connection.
Here's an example of use (check [`DB::selectChats()`][DB::selectChats] for parameter usage):

```php
$results = Request::sendToActiveChats(
    'sendMessage', // Callback function to execute (see Request.php methods)
    ['text' => 'Hey! Check out the new features!!'], // Param to evaluate the request
    [
        'groups'      => true,
        'supergroups' => true,
        'channels'    => false,
        'users'       => true,
    ]
);
```

You can also broadcast a message to users, from the private chat with your bot. Take a look at the [admin commands](#admin-commands) below.

## Utils

### MySQL storage (Recommended)

If you want to save messages/users/chats for further usage in commands, create a new database (`utf8mb4_unicode_520_ci`), import *[structure.sql]* and enable MySQL support BEFORE `handle()` method:

```php
$mysql_credentials = [
   'host'     => 'localhost',
   'port'     => 3306, // optional
   'user'     => 'dbuser',
   'password' => 'dbpass',
   'database' => 'dbname',
];

$telegram->enableMySql($mysql_credentials);
```

You can set a custom prefix to all the tables while you are enabling MySQL:

```php
$telegram->enableMySql($mysql_credentials, $bot_username . '_');
```

You can also store inline query and chosen inline query data in the database.

#### External Database connection

It is possible to provide the library with an external MySQL PDO connection.
Here's how to configure it:

```php
$telegram->enableExternalMySql($external_pdo_connection);
//$telegram->enableExternalMySql($external_pdo_connection, $table_prefix)
```
### Channels Support

All methods implemented can be used to manage channels.
With [admin commands](#admin-commands) you can manage your channels directly with your bot private chat.

## Commands

### Predefined Commands

The bot is able to recognise commands in a chat with multiple bots (/command@mybot).

It can also execute commands that get triggered by events, so-called Service Messages.

### Custom Commands

Maybe you would like to develop your own commands.
There is a guide to help you [create your own commands][wiki-create-your-own-commands].

Also, be sure to have a look at the [example commands][ExampleCommands-folder] to learn more about custom commands and how they work.

You can add your custom commands in different ways:

```php
// Add a folder that contains command files
$telegram->addCommandsPath('/path/to/command/files');
//$telegram->addCommandsPaths(['/path/to/command/files', '/another/path']);

// Add a command directly using the class name
$telegram->addCommandClass(MyCommand::class);
//$telegram->addCommandClasses([MyCommand::class, MyOtherCommand::class]);
```

### Commands Configuration

With this method you can set some command specific parameters, for example:

```php
// Google geocode/timezone API key for /date command
$telegram->setCommandConfig('date', [
    'google_api_key' => 'your_google_api_key_here',
]);

// OpenWeatherMap API key for /weather command
$telegram->setCommandConfig('weather', [
    'owm_api_key' => 'your_owm_api_key_here',
]);
```

### Admin Commands

Enabling this feature, the bot admin can perform some super user commands like:
- List all the chats started with the bot */chats*
- Clean up old database entries */cleanup*
- Show debug information about the bot */debug*
- Send message to all chats */sendtoall*
- Post any content to your channels */sendtochannel*
- Inspect a user or a chat with */whois*

Take a look at all default admin commands stored in the *[src/Commands/AdminCommands/][AdminCommands-folder]* folder.

#### Set Admins

You can specify one or more admins with this option:

```php
// Single admin
$telegram->enableAdmin(your_telegram_user_id);

// Multiple admins
$telegram->enableAdmins([
    your_telegram_user_id,
    other_telegram_user_id,
]);
```
Telegram user id can be retrieved with the *[/whoami][WhoamiCommand.php]* command.

#### Channel Administration

To enable this feature follow these steps:
- Add your bot as channel administrator, this can be done with any Telegram client.
- Enable admin interface for your user as explained in the admin section above.
- Enter your channel name as a parameter for the *[/sendtochannel][SendtochannelCommand.php]* command:
```php
$telegram->setCommandConfig('sendtochannel', [
    'your_channel' => [
        '@type_here_your_channel',
    ]
]);
```
- If you want to manage more channels:
```php
$telegram->setCommandConfig('sendtochannel', [
    'your_channel' => [
        '@type_here_your_channel',
        '@type_here_another_channel',
        '@and_so_on',
    ]
]);
```

A simple to use library to create Telegram Bots in Java

## Contributions
Feel free to fork this project, work on it and then make a pull request against **DEV** branch. Most of the times I will accept them if they add something valuable to the code.

Please, **DO NOT PUSH ANY TOKEN OR API KEY**, I will never accept a pull request with that content.

## Webhooks vs GetUpdates
Both ways are supported, but I recommend long polling method.

## Usage

Just import add the library to your project with one of these options:

  1. Using Maven Central Repository:

```xml
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.telegram</groupId>
        <artifactId>telegrambots</artifactId>
        <version>5.7.1</version>
    </dependency>
```

  2. Using Gradle: 

```gradle
    implementation 'org.telegram:telegrambots:5.7.1'
```

  3. Using Jitpack from [here](https://jitpack.io/#rubenlagus/TelegramBots/5.7.1)
  4. Download the jar(including all dependencies) from [here](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.telegram/telegrambots/5.7.1)

In order to use Long Polling mode, just create your own bot extending `org.telegram.telegrambots.bots.TelegramLongPollingBot`.

If you like to use Webhook, extend `org.telegram.telegrambots.bots.TelegramWebhookBot`


Once done, you just need to create a `org.telegram.telegrambots.meta.TelegramBotsApi`and register your bots:

```java

    // Example taken from https://github.com/rubenlagus/TelegramBotsExample
    public class Main {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            try {
                TelegramBotsApi telegramBotsApi = new TelegramBotsApi(DefaultBotSession.class);
                telegramBotsApi.registerBot(new ChannelHandlers());
                telegramBotsApi.registerBot(new DirectionsHandlers());
                telegramBotsApi.registerBot(new RaeHandlers());
                telegramBotsApi.registerBot(new WeatherHandlers());
                telegramBotsApi.registerBot(new TransifexHandlers());
                telegramBotsApi.registerBot(new FilesHandlers());
            } catch (TelegramApiException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        }
    }

```

For detailed explanation, visite our [How To](https://github.com/rubenlagus/TelegramBots/wiki/Getting-Started) (thanks Clevero)


## Example bots
Open them and send them */help* command to get some information about their capabilities:

https://telegram.me/weatherbot (**Use custom keyboards**)

https://telegram.me/directionsbot (**Basic messages**)

https://telegram.me/filesbot (**Send files by file_id**)

https://telegram.me/TGlanguagesbot (**Send files uploding them**)

https://telegram.me/RaeBot (**Inline support**)

https://telegram.me/SnowcrashBot (**Webhook support**)

You can see code for those bots at [TelegramBotsExample](https://github.com/rubenlagus/TelegramBotsExample) project.

## Telegram Bot API
This library use [Telegram bot API](https://core.telegram.org/bots), you can find more information following the link.

MusicBot is the original Discord music bot written for [Python](https://www.python.org ""Python homepage"") 3.8+, using the [pycord](https://github.com/Pycord-Development/pycord) library. It plays requested songs from YouTube and other services into a Discord server (or multiple servers). Besides, if the queue becomes empty MusicBot will play through a list of existing songs with configuration. The bot features a permission system allowing owners to restrict commands to certain people. As well as playing songs, MusicBot is capable of streaming live media into a voice channel (experimental).

![Main](https://i.imgur.com/FWcHtcS.png)

## Setup
Setting up the MusicBot is relatively painless - just follow one of the [guides](https://just-some-bots.github.io/MusicBot/). After that, configure the bot to ensure its connection to Discord.

The main configuration file is `config/options.ini`, but it is not included by default. Simply make a copy of `example_options.ini` and rename it to `options.ini`. See `example_options.ini` for more information about configurations.

### Commands

There are many commands that can be used with the bot. Most notably, the `play <url>` command (preceded by your command prefix) will download, process, and play a song from YouTube or a similar site. A full list of commands is available [here](https://just-some-bots.github.io/MusicBot/using/commands/ ""Commands"").

[qwx: WeChat Qt frontend 微信Qt前端](https://github.com/xiangzhai/qwx)

**master-dev 分支为开发版本，用于测试新特性，欢迎使用后提出建议!**


## 1 环境与依赖

此版本只能运行于Python 2环境 。

**wxBot** 用到了Python **requests** , **pypng** , **Pillow** 以及 **pyqrcode** 库。

使用之前需要所依赖的库:

```bash
pip install requests
pip install pyqrcode
pip install pypng
pip install Pillow
```

## 2 快速开发

利用 **wxBot** 最简单的方法就是继承WXBot类并实现 `handle_msg_all` 或者 `schedule` 函数，然后实例化子类并调用 `run` 方法 。

### 2.1 代码

以下的代码对所有来自好友的文本消息回复文本消息 *hi* 、图片消息 *1.png* 以及文件消息 *1.png* ， 并不断向好友 *tb* 发送文本 *schedule* 。

`handle_msg_all` 函数用于处理收到的每条消息，而 `schedule` 函数可以做一些任务性的工作(例如不断向好友推送信息或者一些定时任务)。

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python
# coding: utf-8

import time
from wxbot import *

class MyWXBot(WXBot):
    def handle_msg_all(self, msg):
        if msg['msg_type_id'] == 4 and msg['content']['type'] == 0:
            self.send_msg_by_uid(u'hi', msg['user']['id'])
            self.send_img_msg_by_uid(""img/1.png"", msg['user']['id'])
            self.send_file_msg_by_uid(""img/1.png"", msg['user']['id'])

    def schedule(self):
        self.send_msg(u'tb', u'schedule')
        time.sleep(1)

def main():
    bot = MyWXBot()
    bot.DEBUG = True
    bot.run()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()

```

### 2.2 运行

直接用 `python` 运行代码(如运行测试代码 ***test.py*** ):

``` python
python test.py
```

### 2.3 登录微信

程序运行之后，会在当前目录下生成二维码图片文件 ***qr.png*** 并自动打开，用微信扫描此二维码并按操作指示确认登录网页微信。

如果运行在Linux下，还可以通过设置 **WXBot** 对象的 `conf['qr']` 为 `tty` 的方式直接在终端打印二维码(此方法只能在Linux终端下使用)，效果如下：

### 4.4 群文本消息

由于群文本消息中可能含有@信息，因此群文本消息的 `content` 字典除了含有 `type` 与 `data` 字段外，还含有 `detail` 与 `desc` 字段。

各字段内容为：

| 字段 | 内容 |
| --- | ---- |
| `type` | 数据类型， 为0(文本) |
| `data` | 字符串，消息内容，含有@信息 |

| `get_msg_img(msgid)` | 获取图像消息并保存到本地文件 ***img_[msgid].jpg*** , `msgid` 为消息id(Web微信数据) |
| `get_voice(msgid)` | 获取语音消息并保存到本地文件 ***voice_[msgid].mp3*** , `msgid` 为消息id(Web微信数据) |
| `get_video(msgid)` | 获取视频消息并保存到本地文件 ***video_[msgid].mp4*** , `msgid` 为消息id(Web微信数据) |
| `get_contact_name(uid)` | 获取微信id对应的名称，返回一个可能包含 `remark_name` (备注名), `nickname` (昵称), `display_name` (群名称)的字典|
| `send_msg_by_uid(word, dst)` | 向好友发送消息，`word` 为消息字符串，`dst` 为好友用户id(Web微信数据) |

| `is_contact(uid)` | 判断id为 `uid` 的账号是否是本帐号的好友，返回 `True` (是)或 `False` (不是) |
| `is_public(uid)` | 判断id为 `uid` 的账号是否是本帐号所关注的公众号，返回 `True` (是)或 `False` (不是) |


## 5 群聊机器人示例

***bot.py*** 用 **[图灵机器人](http://www.tuling123.com/)** API 以及 **wxBot** 实现了一个自动回复机器人.

此机器人会回复来自联系人的消息，以及群里@此账号的消息。

并且本帐号可以通过发送 *退下* 、 *走开* 、 *关闭* 、 *关掉* 、 *休息* 、 *滚开* 来关闭机器人的自动回复。

也可以通过发送 *出来* 、 *启动* 、 *工作* 来再次开启机器人的自动回复。

群聊时需要将对应的群保存到联系人列表。

群聊实现效果：

![群聊](img/group_chat.png)

![群聊后台](img/group_chat_backend.jpg)


***bot.py*** 的运行方法：

- 要接入图灵机器人API时：

  1. 在[图灵机器人官网](http://www.tuling123.com/)注册账号，申请图灵key: [图灵key申请地址](http://www.tuling123.com/html/doc/apikey.html)

  2. 在 ***bot.py*** 文件所在目录下新建 ***conf.ini*** 文件，内容为:(key字段内容为申请到的图灵key)

    ```txt
    [main]    
    key=1d2678900f734aa0a23734ace8aec5b1
    ```

  3. 运行 ***bot.py***

    ```python
    python bot.py
    ```

- 不接入图灵机器人API时(此时机器人对联系人消息以及群里@自己的消息统一回复 *知道了* )：
  1. 运行 ***bot.py***

    ```python
    python bot.py
    ```

# Overview

Red is a fully modular bot – meaning all features and commands can be enabled/disabled to your
liking, making it completely customizable. This is a *self-hosted bot* – meaning you will need
to host and maintain your own instance. You can turn Red into an admin bot, music bot, trivia bot,
new best friend or all of these together!  

[Installation](#installation) is easy, and you do **NOT** need to know anything about coding! Aside
from installing and updating, every part of the bot can be controlled from within Discord.

**The default set of modules includes and is not limited to:**

- Moderation features (kick/ban/softban/hackban, mod-log, filter, chat cleanup)
- Trivia (lists are included and can be easily added)
- Music features (YouTube, SoundCloud, local files, playlists, queues)
- Stream alerts (Twitch, Youtube, Picarto)
- Bank (slot machine, user credits)
- Custom commands
- Imgur/gif search
- Admin automation (self-role assignment, cross-server announcements, mod-mail reports)
- Customisable command permissions

**Additionally, other [plugins](#plugins) (cogs) can be easily found and added from our growing
community of cog repositories.**

# Installation

**The following platforms are officially supported:** 

- [Windows](https://docs.discord.red/en/stable/install_guides/windows.html)
- [MacOS](https://docs.discord.red/en/stable/install_guides/mac.html)
- [Most major linux distributions](https://docs.discord.red/en/stable/install_guides/index.html)

If after reading the guide you are still experiencing issues, feel free to join the
[Official Discord Server](https://discord.gg/red) and ask in the **#support** channel for help.

# Plugins

Red is fully modular, allowing you to load and unload plugins of your choice, and install 3rd party
plugins directly from Discord! A few examples are:

- Cleverbot integration (talk to Red and she talks back)
- Ban sync
- Welcome messages
- Casino
- Reaction roles
- Slow Mode
- AniList
- And much, much more!

Feel free to take a [peek](https://index.discord.red) at a list of
available 3rd party cogs!

# Join the community!

**Red** is in continuous development, and it’s supported by an active community which produces new
content (cogs/plugins) for everyone to enjoy. New features are constantly added. If you can’t
[find](https://index.discord.red) the cog you’re looking for,
consult our [guide](https://docs.discord.red/en/stable/guide_cog_creation.html) on
building your own cogs!

## Good Bye!
 Due to legal action being started against other bot creators/devs (we did not receive a letter yet) the Project development will be stopped. All Source Files / Downloads will be removed. We now have to say Good Bye to the awesome Community. Over 100k Members on Discord and 500k Downloads a day! The Discord Community will remain open for Discussions. It was fun, we had a nice time. Thank you for the Donaions, all Devs will be getting their share by today.

43,43,Flipboard/bottomsheet,Java,"# BottomSheet

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Flipboard/bottomsheet.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/Flipboard/bottomsheet) [![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/Flipboard/bottomsheet](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/Flipboard/bottomsheet?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

BottomSheet is an Android component which presents a dismissible view from the bottom of the screen. BottomSheet can be a useful replacement for dialogs and menus but can hold any view so the use cases are endless. This repository includes the BottomSheet component itself but also includes a set of common view components presented in a bottom sheet. These are located in the commons module.

BottomSheet has been used in production at Flipboard for a while now so it is thoroughly tested. Here is a GIF of it in action inside of Flipboard!

![FlipUI gif](http://i.imgur.com/2e3ZhoU.gif)

## Installation

If all you want is the BottomSheet component and don't need things from commons you can skip that dependency.

```groovy
repositories {
    jcenter()
}

dependencies {
    compile 'com.flipboard:bottomsheet-core:1.5.3'
    compile 'com.flipboard:bottomsheet-commons:1.5.3' // optional
}
```

## Getting Started

Get started by wrapping your layout in a `BottomSheetLayout`. So if you currently have this:

```xml
<LinearLayout
    android:id=""@+id/root""
    android:orientation=""vertical""
    android:layout_width=""match_parent""
    android:layout_height=""match_parent"">

    <View
        android:id=""@+id/view1""
        android:layout_width=""match_parent""
        android:layout_height=""match_parent""/>

</LinearLayout>
```

You would have to update it to look like this:

```xml
<com.flipboard.bottomsheet.BottomSheetLayout
    android:id=""@+id/bottomsheet""
    android:layout_width=""match_parent""
    android:layout_height=""match_parent"">

    <LinearLayout
        android:id=""@+id/root""
        android:orientation=""vertical""
        android:layout_width=""match_parent""
        android:layout_height=""match_parent"">

        <View
            android:id=""@+id/view1""
            android:layout_width=""match_parent""
            android:layout_height=""match_parent""/>

    </LinearLayout>

</com.flipboard.bottomsheet.BottomSheetLayout>
```

Back in your activity or fragment you would get a reference to the BottomSheetLayout like any other view.

```java
BottomSheetLayout bottomSheet = (BottomSheetLayout) findViewById(R.id.bottomsheet);
```

Now all you need to do is show a view in the bottomSheet:

```java
bottomSheet.showWithSheetView(LayoutInflater.from(context).inflate(R.layout.my_sheet_layout, bottomSheet, false));
```

You could also use one of the sheet views from the commons module.

```java
bottomSheet.showWithSheetView(new IntentPickerSheetView(this, shareIntent, ""Share with..."", new IntentPickerSheetView.OnIntentPickedListener() {
    @Override
    public void onIntentPicked(IntentPickerSheetView.ActivityInfo activityInfo) {
        bottomSheet.dismissSheet();
        startActivity(activityInfo.getConcreteIntent(shareIntent));
    }
}));
```

That's it for the simplest of use cases. Check out the [API documentation](https://github.com/Flipboard/bottomsheet/wiki/API-Documentation) to find out how to customize BottomSheet to fit your use cases.

For more examples, also see the [Recipes](https://github.com/Flipboard/bottomsheet/wiki/Recipes) wiki.

## Common Components

These are located in the optional `bottomsheet-commons` dependency and implement common use cases for bottom sheet.

Intent Picker | Menu Sheet | ImagePicker Sheet
--- | --- | ---
![IntentPickerSheetView gif](http://i.imgur.com/wr9HJD1.gif) | ![MenuSheetView gif](http://i.imgur.com/f2j9Y5e.gif) | ![ImagePickerSheetView gif](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/23a9cf2bf9353a98d1b585e79d06639c7f5297c7/687474703a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f6f67764b4735692e676966)

### IntentPickerSheetView

This component presents an intent chooser in the form of a BottomSheet view. Give it an intent such as a share intent and let the user choose what activity they want to share the intent with in a BottomSheet.

Example from the sample app.

```java
IntentPickerSheetView intentPickerSheet = new IntentPickerSheetView(MainActivity.this, shareIntent, ""Share with..."", new IntentPickerSheetView.OnIntentPickedListener() {
    @Override
    public void onIntentPicked(IntentPickerSheetView.ActivityInfo activityInfo) {
        bottomSheet.dismissSheet();
        startActivity(activityInfo.getConcreteIntent(shareIntent));
    }
});
// Filter out built in sharing options such as bluetooth and beam.
intentPickerSheet.setFilter(new IntentPickerSheetView.Filter() {
    @Override
    public boolean include(IntentPickerSheetView.ActivityInfo info) {
        return !info.componentName.getPackageName().startsWith(""com.android"");
    }
});
// Sort activities in reverse order for no good reason
intentPickerSheet.setSortMethod(new Comparator<IntentPickerSheetView.ActivityInfo>() {
    @Override
    public int compare(IntentPickerSheetView.ActivityInfo lhs, IntentPickerSheetView.ActivityInfo rhs) {
        return rhs.label.compareTo(lhs.label);
    }
});
bottomSheet.showWithSheetView(intentPickerSheet);
```

### MenuSheetView

This component presents a BottomSheet view that's backed by a menu. It behaves similarly to the new `NavigationView` in the Design support library, and is intended to mimic the examples in the Material Design spec. It supports list and grid states, with the former adding further support for separators and subheaders.

Example from the sample app.

```java
MenuSheetView menuSheetView =
        new MenuSheetView(MenuActivity.this, MenuSheetView.MenuType.LIST, ""Create..."", new MenuSheetView.OnMenuItemClickListener() {
            @Override
            public boolean onMenuItemClick(MenuItem item) {
                Toast.makeText(MenuActivity.this, item.getTitle(), Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
                if (bottomSheetLayout.isSheetShowing()) {
                    bottomSheetLayout.dismissSheet();
                }
                return true;
            }
        });
menuSheetView.inflateMenu(R.menu.create);
bottomSheetLayout.showWithSheetView(menuSheetView);
```

## Introduction

Superalgos is not just another open-source project. We are an open and welcoming community devised, nurtured, and incentivized with the project's native [Superalgos (SA) Token](https://superalgos.org/token-overview.shtml) to build an [open trading intelligence network](https://superalgos.org/).

You will notice the difference as soon as you join the [Telegram Community Group](https://t.me/superalgoscommunity) or the new [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/CGeKC6WQQb)!

## Getting Started Guide

Superalgos is an ever growing ecosystem of tools and applications.  This guide will walk you through the main ways to install the Superalgos Platform (which is the flagship application of the ecosystem).  Other applications, such as a mobile app, and a p2p networking app, are currently under development.  

There are a variety of methods to install the Superalgos Platform ranging from docker installations and packaged application installations, to fine grained technical installations.  The following instructions will present each type of installation from easiest to most technical.  

> **Note**: 
> 
> If you would like to try out Superalgos without any installation, you can check out our online demo [here](https://superalgos.org/crypto-trading-bots-platform-demo.shtml).


### Packaged Application Installation

This is by far the easiest way to get started with Superalgos! 

These packages contain the source code for the Superalgos platform wrapped together in one convinent file.  To find these files you can go to Superalgos' [releases page](https://github.com/Superalgos/Superalgos/releases). The releases are organized using two main categories.  First are the stable releases that comes out roughly once a month and are the most tested and bug free.  Second are the nightly development snapshots that offer the most up to date code, but have not under gone the same rigorous testing. 

> **Note**: 
> 
> If you are just getting started, it is recommended to begin with installing the most recent stable release before trying out one of the development snapshots.

Once you have chosen which type of release you would like to install, you can then find the proper package for your operating system. Each operating system has it's own packaged application to work natively within your operating system.  The following list highlights the currently available packages:  

> **IMPORTANT:**
> 
> These installers are not code signed (this costs money and Superalgos is completely free for everyone). Therefore, antivirus will probably flag the file as unsecure. You can force the installation to allow the packages to run.  A more detailed explanation of this can be found in this [medium article](https://medium.com/superalgos/superalgos-packaged-application-release-8befd2895102). If this makes you uncomfortable, it is recommended you look into some of the other installation methods that do not suffer from this limitation.

> **NOTE ABOUT ASCENDEX:**
>
> An issue with AscendEX API may prevent the Welcome to Superalgos tutorial to run as expected. We suggest you use the fallback/default workspace in the meantime. The issue was reported to the exchange and is currently being investigated. 


#### Windows Portable Application

This package requires zero installation! Simply download the package (Superalgos-win-{version}.exe) and you’re good to go. All the exchange data that is downloaded and the workspaces you save are stored in your default documents folder (My Documents on Windows) under the Superalgos_Data folder. This way it is easier for you to backup data and not lose it between reinstallation.

#### Windows Setup Package

Also on windows, there is a more traditional installer that installs the application and sets up the correct icons and shortcuts for you. This way you have a nice entry on the programs list. The downloaded data is stored in your documents folder under the Superalgos_Data folder. This way it is easier for you to backup data and not lose it between reinstallation.

#### MacOS Image

Users of MacOS have the option of downloading a DMG package. Installation is as simple as downloading the DMG file, copying it into your Applications folder, and run `xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine Superalgos.app` from the Terminal (Intel/M1) or allow the app in `System Preferences > Security & Privacy > General > Open Anyway` (Intel only)!

Currently, there are two types of DMG packages. The x64 variant (for Intel based Mac only), as well as the ARM64 variant for the newer Apple Silicon (M1) based machines. All data is stored in the user's Documents folder under the Superalgos_Data folder. This way it is easier for you to backup data and not lose it between reinstallation.

For a more detailed walk through of the ins and outs of Superalgos packaged installations see this [medium article](https://medium.com/superalgos/superalgos-packaged-application-release-8befd2895102).

#### Pros and Cons of Packaged Installations

The packaged applications are by far the easiest way to install the Superalgos Platform. All of the day to day functionality of the platform is readily available, as well as the ability to create and submit a User Profile to the Governance system! 

The main draw back for this type of installation comes with limitations on the ablity to add contributions. Submitting a review, editing and translating the docs, or any kind of code contribution is not possible from a packaged installation.   

### Docker Installations

Docker installations are another avenue that allows for an easy and clean installation of the Superalgos Platform. While a little more techincal than the packaged applications, it offers the ability to install the platform in a clean and isolated enviroment. 

You can find a walk through for docker installations in our [Docker Guide](Docker/README.md).

Traditional docker installations are not meant to be development environments. Meaning that you cannot submit a review, edit and translate the docs, or any kind of code contribution.  That being said, there is a custom docker image that will allow you to install the platform in a development compatible configuration.  You can find the image and a walk through for installing it [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/martinb78/superalgos-docker-develop).

> **IMPORTANT:**
> 
> Please note that the development compatible docker image is not the standard meathod to install Superalgos for contributing. If you are new to contributing, or are not an expereinced developer, it is recommended that you follow the steps for a standard techincal installation.

#### Pros and Cons of Docker Installations

The main purpose of docker installations are for production instances.  This is because the Superalgos Platform will be installed in a nice and clean environment that can be controlled separately from the rest of your computer. This makes it a perfect candidate for users who wish to set up an instance of the platform to run dependably without interruption.

Being aimed at production, this means that standard docker installations are not a good option for users looking to contribute to the ecosystem. Youw will not be able to create a User Profile for the Governance system, submite a review, edit and translate the docs, or contribute any kind of code.     

The development compatible docker installation is for special use cases. For example, using a local NAS to host the platform while still being able to add contributions. This is a nonstandard way of installing Superalgos and is only recommended for users who are comfortable using docker and dealing with potential pitfalls of installing using his method. 

### Contributors Installation

It is also possible to install the Superalgos Platfrom from source code. This is the most pure (albeit more techincal) way of installing Superalgos. There are no limitations to contributing (highly appreciated and rewarded with SA tokens) and gives the user the most freedom for custom configurations.

> **Note**: 
> 
> If you are just starting out and want to contribute, this is the recommended method of installation to follow.

All procedures (other than pre-requisites) are the same for Windows, Linux, or Mac OS. Raspberry Pi terminal commands have been included for ease of use.

> **IMPORTANT:**
> 
> Remote installations and minimalist hardware — both virtual and physical — are better suited for production deployments, where the use of the GUI is minimal. We highly recommend learning Superalgos in a local installation. Mastering the system takes time, and the use of the GUI to go through in-app tutorials is crucial during the learning process. Your experience will be orders of magnitude better if you follow this advice: leave remote installations and minimalist hardware for when you are ready to start trading live.

#### Pre-Requisites

In order to run Superalgos on your computer, you will need the latest versions of Node JS and Git installed. You will also need a web browser to access the interface. Google Chrome is recommended because it is the most tested browser being used by the development team and power users.

Follow the installation wizards to install the latest NodeJS, and Git. If desired also install Chrome.
- [Node.js download page](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [Git download page](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [Google Chrome download page](https://www.google.com/chrome/)

#### Windows Pre-Requisites (Optional)

For windows users interested in trying out the machine learning features of the platform (TensorFlow), Python will need to be installed.
- [install Python 3.9](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-390/).

For contributors that are Windows users, Github Desktop is a helpful tool to manage contributions.  You can install it using the following link.
- [GitHub Desktop download page](https://desktop.github.com/). Click the ""Download for Windows"" button and follow the wizard to install after the download completes.


#### Mac OS Pre-Requisites (Optional)

Rather than manually installing NodeJS, Git, and Python, [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) can be used to install the requirements with minimal effort on Mac OS.  After you clone the repository, change directory to the Superalgos base and install the requirements using Homebrew. 

> **Note**: 
> 
> Python 3 is only required for running machine learning (TensorFlow).

There are two ways to use Homebrew.  The first is to type:

```sh
brew install git node npm python@3.9
```

The second is to use the `Brewfile` included in the code repository. After downloading, run this command in the same directory where the `Brewfile` resides:

```sh
brew bundle
```

> **Note**: 
> 
> You can use Safari or Google Chrome as your default browser. If you run into a bug in Safari, you will be asked to reproduce it in Chrome as the development team uses Chrome.

#### Linux (e.g. Ubuntu, or Raspberry Pi running Raspberry Pi OS/Raspbian) Pre-Requisites

[Follow the Node.js package manager install instructions](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/) for your distribution to ensure you are getting the latest version of Node.js. Many distributions only maintain an older version in their default repositories. Python 3 is only required for running machine learning (TensorFlow).

```sh
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_17.x | sudo -E bash - && sudo apt-get \
install -y \
nodejs npm git python3
```

You may verify the installed versions with this command string:

```sh
node \
-v && npm \
-v && git --version
```

If you are running headless (i.e. as a server without a monitor attached) then you do not need to install a web browser and you can follow the tutorial for information on connecting remotely to the server.

Alternatively, you can use [https://github.com/nymea/berrylan](https://github.com/nymea/berrylan) to setup a tool for using bluetooth to quickly assign WPA2 access on a WLAN on a Raspbian based Distro. Nymea also has tools for automation of IoT products to allow setting up SuperAlgos as a timed function without needing to learn how to code.

> **IMPORTANT**: 
> 
> If you are having node version errors there is a chance you may need to read the information in the Debian Pre-Requisites section and use NVM to handle node versions. This is due to some distributions having out of date repositories in the package manager lists.

#### Debian or Debian WSL/WSL2 Pre-Requisites
(NVM & NPM Fix)

Debian distributions have been found to have some additional issues with installing the right version of NodeJS needed to run Superalgos. What follows are the steps to fix this issue.

For this to work you will need to [use NVM to install and control node] (https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)

- You will need to remove any versions of node already installed on Debian due to the repositories currently being out of date.
- __This is necessary before proceeding.__ 

```sh
sudo apt \
remove nodejs -y && \
```

```sh
sudo apt \
update && apt upgrade \
-y sudo apt \
install npm -y
```

```sh
sudo apt \
autoremove -y && \
sudo apt autoclean -y
```

```sh
sudo curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.35.3/install.sh | bash
```

_Without running the next 3 commands, you will need to logout of your shell/WSL2 user account before you are to use NVM_
 
```sh
export NVM_DIR=""$HOME/.nvm""
```

```sh
[ -s ""$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"" ] && \. ""$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh""
```

```sh
[ -s ""$NVM_DIR/bash_completion"" ] && \. ""$NVM_DIR/bash_completion""
```

_Make sure things are up to date and packages not needed are removed_


```sh
sudo apt update \
sudo apt upgrade && \
apt autoremove -y
```

```sh
cd
```

into the directory of SuperAlgos
and __run the install commands as follows__:

```sh
nvm run node <command string/var>
```

> **Note**: 
> 
> This is for node.js/node only, npm should work fine with Debian.

### WSL2 VSCode IDE Environment Setup (Optional) 

VSCode is a poplular IDE used by contributors to develop Superalgos. This short section covers some helpful tips for setting up the IDE's development enviroment.

There are a few things that need configured to obtain full functionality from VSCode. These configurations will make it possible to run notebooks for ML/AI algos and turn VSCode and Windows into a development bench for working with Superalgos.

On windows:
- First you need to install WSL and WSL2 [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) then reboot if promoted.
  - You may want to review the Docker WSL2 Backend information for VSCode as well before proceeding. [https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/containers/docker-wsl2](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/containers/docker-wsl2)
  - Install Debian or Ubuntu from the Windows Store, Setup the VM as instructed.
  
On windows and Debian:
To make managing these WSL instances a lot easier, we will now move to installing VSCode + Tools to allow for Dockerizing and rapidly deploying as well as editing and manging test/usage cases of SuperAlgos edit and forks you create and contribute.
- Install VSCode [https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/?dv=win64user](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/?dv=win64user)
  - Install the remote container and remote docker plugins/extensions for Visual Studio Code [https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers#_installation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers#_installation) 
    - _You may want to spend time reading the specifics of this documentation on their website._ 
  - *When prompted* install shell shortcuts for right click options, this way you can open Superalgos really easy inside of VSCode.

> **IMPORTANT**: 
> 
> As mentioned above, you need to remove node.js/node from your system and install NVM if you are using Debian.
> Please refer to the information above for properly setting up node.js and npm on Debian systems with complications regarding versions of node.

Once the install finishes you can now use VSCode as an interactive IDE/Shell to access SuperAlgos, run Dockers for working with SuperAlgos and more.


## Superalgos Platform Client Installation

Now that you have all the pre-requisites and optional enviroment configurations set up, now we can get to the core installations of Superalgos!

### Fork the Superalgos Repository

- Scroll the page all the way to the top. Find and click the **Fork** button to create your fork/copy of this repository. To fork Superalgos you need a Github account. If you don't have one, go ahead and create it.

> **NOTE**
> 
> A Fork is required for your contributions to the project. The reason why Superalgos is free and open-source is that the project has set up a [collective business](https://superalgos.org) in which all users may participate. The way to participate is to [contribute](https://superalgos.org/community-contribute.shtml) to make Superalgos better. The project's [token](https://superalgos.org/token-overview.shtml) is distributed among contributors.

### Clone Your Fork

- Once the fork is created, you will land on the page of your fork. Copy the URL from your browser's address bar.
- In your computer/laptop/server, open a command prompt or terminal. Make sure you are in a directory where you have write permissions (on most systems the terminal will open in your user's home directory, so you're good). Clone the git repository using the command:

```sh
git clone <URL of your Superalgos fork>
```

For example, if your Github username is John, the command will look like this:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/John/Superalgos
```

This creates the `Superalgos` folder in the current directory, which contains the whole installation.

### Install Node Dependencies

After the Superalgos directory has been installed, the final step of installation is to set up the necessary node dependencies. In the same command prompt or terminal you just used, type the following:

```sh
cd Superalgos
```

That should take you inside the Superalgos folder created by the `git clone` command earlier. Now type `node setup` to install the dependencies.

```sh
node setup
```

By default, desktop shortcuts are created if they can be. Currently, Mac OS shortcuts are not created. Linux installations may require extra steps to view and use the shortcuts.

Available Options:

```sh
usage: node setup <options>
```

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `noShortcuts` | Do not install desktop shortcuts |
| `tensorflow` | Include the TensorFlow dependencies |

> **NOTE FOR WINDOWS USERS INSTALLING TENSORFLOW DEPENDENCIES:**
> 
> You may get an error at the end of the set up process. If you do, please follow the instructions following the error message.

> **NOTE FOR USERS INSTALLING MULTIPLE INSTANCES OF SUPERALGOS ON THE SAME MACHINE:**
> 
> In order to avoid name conflicts between shortcuts, make sure to rename each Superalgos directory before running `node setup`.

> **NOTE FOR USERS INSTALLING ON LINUX:**
> 
> If after running `node setup` you are prompted to address issues by running 'npm audit fix' ignore this step.


Congratulations your installation is complete! Follow the ""Running the Application"" directions below.

#### Troubleshooting Dependency Installation

If you are having difficulty running the node setup command here are a few common issues that may be getting in the way.

1. Check the version of node and npm you have installed. Make sure that you are running an updated version of node greater than version 16.6 and npm greater than version 5. You can check which version you have by typing `node -v` and `npm -v` into a command prompt or terminal. If your version numbers are below these, you can update your installation by following the instructions outlined in the ""Node JS Installation"" step above.
2. If you are installing Superalgos in an administratively protected directory you will need to do one of the following:
   - For Windows start your command prompt as an administrator.
   - For Linux and Mac Systems make sure to add the sudo command to node setup.  This will look like `sudo node setup`.
3. For Windows it is important that you have C:\Windows\System32 added to your global PATH.  For instructions on how to do this google ""add to the path on Windows 10.""

#### Enable Desktop Shortcut in Ubuntu

The majority of shortcuts that are automatically installed will work out of the box. Desktop shortcuts on Ubuntu, however, require a few additional steps to set up. First, desktop icons need to be enabled within the Tweaks app.

- Check if Tweaks is installed.
- If not go to Ubuntu Software.
- Install Tweaks.
- Open Tweaks.
- Under extensions turn on Desktop Icons

![enable-ubuntu-shortcut](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55707292/117553927-f0780300-b019-11eb-9e36-46b509653283.gif)

> **TIP:** If you do not see the desktop shortcut appear right away you may need to restart your computer.

Finally, you will need to enable the desktop shortcut. Right click Superalgos.desktop and select Allow Launching.

![allow-launching](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55707292/117553933-fcfc5b80-b019-11eb-872c-4fad81b184d2.gif)

Now both launcher and desktop shortcuts will launch Superalgos like any other program on your computer.

### Installation Notes

- You need to make a fork so that you may contribute work. Superalgos is a Community project and you are expected to contribute, like everyone else. You don't need to be a technical person to contribute. Fixing a typo in the docs or translating a paragraph into your native language are valuable contributions too. Superalgos has built-in features that make contributing easy. Help make Superalgos better and Superalgos will better serve you! Free-riding is not cool, particularly on free, open-source, Community-driven projects.
- The software includes an in-app self-update command / feature. It will help you stay up-to-date with the latest version of the software. Updates are on-demand, so don't worry about undesired updates. The project moves very fast and new features become available regularly, particularly if you choose to run the software in the `develop` branch (you may switch branches from within the app).
- It is a good idea to periodically run the `node setup` command to keep the underlying dependencies for your Superalgos installation up to date.
- Before installing the client on a remote computer in an attempt to access the UI from a different machine, we highly recommend you do a standard installation on your PC / laptop first. Leave your Raspberry Pi or VPS for later, once you have done all available tutorials. This single tip will save you a lot of time: you don't need to add complexity before you learn how to handle the app, and the GUI performs best in a local installation.

### Uninstall

Superalgos writes nothing outside of the `Superalgos` folder other than shortcut files. In order to quickly remove the shortcut files, open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to your main Superalgos directory, and type the following command:

```sh
node uninstall
```

Then simply delete the `Superalgos` folder to completely remove the application.

## Usage

### Partner Exchanges

The Superalgos Platform is exchange-agnostic, but [the project offers partner exchanges](https://superalgos.org/partner-exchanges.shtml) custom support and a curated onboarding experience for their customers. In turn, partner exchanges offer preferential trading fees and, in some cases, other benefits to Superalgos users.

Find more information on how to get the benefits in the corresponding Telegram group.

| Partner Exchange | Benefits | Telegram Group |
|--- |--- |-- |
| AscendEX | VIP 2 (7.5 bip Maker, 8.5 bip Taker) | https://t.me/superalgosascendex |

Partner exchanges have custom workspaces for the onboarding of their users. The following sections cover how to use them from the get-go.

### Run the Client and GUI

#### Using the shortcuts

> **NOTE:** This method launches the platform with the fallback workspace only. If you wish to launch with a partner exchange workspace, use the Command Line method instead.

If you ran `node setup` with no options above, then you should see a desktop icon which you can double click to launch the Superalgos application. A terminal window will show the server is running, and a browser window will open with the WebUI.

#### Using the Command Line

To launch the platform with one of the Partner Exchanges custom workspaces, go to the Superalgos directory and run the command as per the following table. You will learn about other options further down this page.

| Partner Exchange | Launch Command |
|--- |--- |
| AscendEX | `node platform Foundations 01-Onboarding-AscendEX` |

> **NOTE ABOUT ASCENDEX:**
>
> An issue with AscendEX API may prevent the Welcome to Superalgos tutorial to run as expected. We suggest you use the fallback/default workspace in the meantime. The issue was reported to the exchange and is currently being investigated. 

To run Superalgos with the fallback workspace, go to the Superalgos directory/folder and run this command:

```sh
node platform
```

Available Options:

```sh
usage: node platform [options] [project] [workspace]
```

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `minMemo` | Run with minimal memory footprint. This is critical for running on platforms with 8GB of ram or less, like a Raspberry Pi. |
| `noBrowser` | Do not attempt to open the WebUI in a browser. This is useful on headless servers where a UI is not available. |

To load a specific workspace on launch, include any options, then the project, then the workspace. For example, to load the Blank-Template workspace of the Foundations project with no options:

```sh
node platform Foundations Blank-Template
```

The Client will run on your terminal and the GUI will launch on your default browser. If Chrome/Safari is not your default browser, copy the URL, close the browser, open Chrome/Safari, and paste the URL. Be patient... it takes a few seconds to fully load the GUI.

A Welcome Tutorial pops-up automatically. You must do this Tutorial to finish the setup and to learn the basics. It's the ultimate onboarding experience, superior to all other resources available, including videos and the Docs.

![run-the-system-01](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13994516/107037804-e5fc6200-67bb-11eb-82f2-d0f40247fa14.gif)

### Usage Notes

We are testing the UI on Google Chrome and Safari on macOS only. It may work on other browsers as well &mdash; or not. If you are running on a different browser and ever need support, make sure you mention that fact upfront, or even better, try on Chrome/Safari first.

> **TIP:**
> 
> If your computer has 8 GB of RAM or less, use `node platform minMemo` to run the system with minimal RAM requirements.

### Running Superalgos on a Headless Linux Server as a Daemon

If you're running Superalgos on a headless linux server like a Raspberry Pi, you might want to run it as a daemon so it isn't attached to your current login session. The easiest, most standard way to go about this is probably using `systemd`. Most linux distributions use it as default init system/service manager.

#### Using Systemd

Create a `superalgos.service` file looking like this (change `<user>` to your user name and `/path/to/Superalgos` to your Superalgos folder, for instance `/home/John/Superalgos`):

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Superalgos Platform Client

[Service]
Type=simple
User=<user>
WorkingDirectory=/path/to/Superalgos
ExecStart=/usr/bin/node platform minMemo noBrowser

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

There is no need to run Superalgos as root so we're running it as a user. The `minMemo` option assumes you're running on a small machine like a Raspberry Pi, while `noBrowser` makes sense for running daemonized. Now, you'll need to move the file to `/etc/systemd/system/` in order for it to be recognized. You'll need then to enable and start the service.

```sh
sudo mv superalgos.service /etc/systemd/system
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable superalgos
sudo systemctl start superalgos
```

To see the output of Superalgos, use:

```sh
journalctl -u superalgos
```

or to follow the output with `-f`:

```sh
journalctl -u superalgos -f
```

### Workspace Refactoring for Version 1

Verion 1.1.1 carries with it a reorganization of the codebase where several projects where extracted from Foundations : Data-Mining, Algorithmic Trading, Machine Learning and Community Plugins.

This means that these projects can now have a project leader and a team working on them.

In order to get your custom workspace upgraded to be compatible with beta 13 you will need to make a few changes:

Project nodes need to be present at the workspace for things to work. The presence of the node of a project, somehow, enables that projects features at a workspace. Go to the workspace node and click add missing projects.

At the Plugins hierarchy, new guys appear, each one with their own type of plugins. Meaning that every workspace needs to be manually fixed, because currently all plugins are loaded from Foundations node there. The fix is easy though, it takes 2 - 3 min to delete the child nodes from the foundation node, and add the same plugins from the project they actually belong now.


## Welcome Tutorial

Once the app finishes loading, an interactive tutorial takes you by the hand and walks you all around the system while you learn the basic skills required to use the interface, mine data, backtest strategies, and even run a live trading session. It is highly recommended you follow the tutorial until the end, as it is carefully crafted to make your onboarding as easy as possible. Tutorials are the absolute best way to tackle the learning curve. You should do all tutorials before you start exploring other avenues on your own.

![welcome-tutorial-00](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13994516/107038771-4a6bf100-67bd-11eb-92e0-353525a972a9.gif)

> **NOTE:**
> 
> The tutorial uses Binance or Binance US as the exchange of choice. If you don't have an account with Binance or Binance US, you will still be able to follow 100% of the tutorial. When you get to the live trading section, keep going even if you don't intend to run the session. You may learn how to work with other exchanges later on.

*""Conversation as a platform (CaaP) is the future, so it's perfect that we're already offering the whole toolkits to our .NET developers using the BotSharp AI BOT Platform Builder to build a CaaP. It opens up as much learning power as possible for your own robots and precisely control every step of the AI processing pipeline.""*
    
**BotSharp** is an open source machine learning framework for AI Bot platform builder. This project involves natural language understanding, computer vision and audio processing technologies, and aims to promote the development and application of intelligent robot assistants in information systems. Out-of-the-box machine learning algorithms allow ordinary programmers to develop artificial intelligence applications faster and easier. 

<img src=""/docs/static/screenshots/BotSharp_arch.png"" width=""100%"">

It's written in C# running on .Net Core that is full cross-platform framework. C# is a enterprise grade programming language which is widely used to code business logic in information management related system. More friendly to corporate developers. BotSharp adopts machine learning algrithm in C# directly. That will facilitate the feature of the typed language C#, and be more easier when refactoring code in system scope. 

Why we do this? Because we all know Python is not friendly programming language for enterprise developers, it's not only because it's low performance but also it's a type weak language, it will be a disaster if you use Python to build your bussiness system.

BotSharp is in accordance with components principle strictly, decouples every part that is needed in the platform builder. So you can choose different UI/UX, or pick up a different NLP Tagger, or select a more advanced algorithm to do NER task. They are all modulized based on unified interfaces.

### Some Features

* Integrated debugging is easier without relying on any other machine learning algorithm libraries.
* Built-in multi-Agents management, easy to build Bot as a Service platform.
* Context In/ Out with lifespan to make conversion flow be controllable.
* Use the natural language processing pipeline mechanism to work with extensions easily, and build your own unique robot processing flows. 
* Rewrote NLP algorithm from ground without historical issues.
* Support export/ import agent from other bot platforms directly. 
* Support different UI providers like `Rasa UI` and `Articulate UI`.
* Support for multiple data request and response formats such as Rasa NLU and Dialogflow.
* Integrate with popular social platforms like Facebook Messenger, Slack and Telegram.
* Multi-core parallel computing optimization, High-Performance C# on GPUs in Hybridizer.

### Quick Started

*  Make sure that you have downloaded the related components.
*  See the file ""BotSharp\BotSharp.WebHost\Settings\app.json"",change the path to your own project's path.
*  Select dialogflow or articulate to make it work.

You can use docker compose to run BotSharp quickly, make sure you've got `Docker`_ installed.

```sh
 PS D:\> git clone https://github.com/dotnetcore/BotSharp
 PS D:\> cd BotSharp
 PS D:\BotSharp\> docker-compose -f dockerfiles/docker-compose-core.yml up
```

Point your web browser at http://localhost:3112 and enjoy BotSharp Core.

### Extension Libraries

BotSharp uses component design, the kernel is kept to a minimum, and business functions are implemented by external components. The modular design also allows contributors to better participate.

* BotSharp platform emulator extension which is compatible with RASA NLU. 
* BotSharp platform emulator extension which is compatible with Google Dialogflow.
* BotSharp platform emulator extension which is compatible with Articulate AI.
* BotSharp platform emulator extension which is compatible with RasaTalk.
* A channel module of BotSharp for Facebook Messenger.
* A channel module of BotSharp for Tencent Wechat.
* A channel module of BotSharp for Telegram.
* Articulate UI customized for BotSharp NLU.

- Migrations is placed in `migrations`
- Entry-point is `app/__main__.py` (Can be executed as `python -m app`)
...

### Contributing

Before you will make commit need to run `black`, `isort` and `Flake8` via command `make lint`
If you change Database models you will need to generate migrations: `make migration message=""do something""`

## Deployment

Here listed only Docker deployment methods. 
That's mean you can't read here how to deploy the bot with other methods instead of Docker 
but you can do that manually.

Also this bot can't be normally started in Docker with polling mode 
because in this mode aiohttp server will be not started and healthcheck can not be started.

### docker-compose

Pre-requirements:
- Docker
- docker-compose

Steps:
- Prepare `.env` file
- ... (TODO)
- `make app-create` - for first deploy, for updating or restarting

Stopping:
- `make docker-stop`

Destroying (with volumes):
- `make docker-destroy`

### Docker Swarm

Pre-requirements:
- Docker (with activated swarm mode)
- traefik 2.0 in Docker (with overlay network named `web`)

### Commands:

...

### How this bot is deployed now?

In Docker Swarm at [Illemius](https://illemius.xyz) with CI/CD

Steps:
1. GitHub Actions:
    1. Build docker image
    1. Publish it to the private **Illemius** Docker registry
    1. Trigger Portainer webhook in the **Illemius** cluster via cURL
1. Portainer will trigger updating of the bot service
1. Docker run new instance of container at specified node
    1. When container is started by first step it will run migrations
1. Docker wait until new instance will be healthy
1. Traefik watch Docker container and update the routes when new one is available
1. Stop old instance of Bot container

## <a name=""new-bot""></a>:computer: Setting up Rita Translator on Heroku

<p align=""center"">
<img src=""https://github-images.s3.amazonaws.com/help/bootcamp/Bootcamp-Fork.png"">
</p><br/><br/>

#### 1. Fork this repository.
* If you don't yet have a Github account, [create one](https://github.com/join)! It's free and easy.
* Click [here](https://github.com/RitaBot-Project/RitaBot/fork) or use the button in the upper righthand side of this page to fork the repository so that it will be associated with your Github account.


* Please ***star our project*** if you like it using the top-right Star icon. Every star helps us! 
<p align=""center"">
<img src=""https://ritabot.gg/assets/images/star.png"" href=""https://github.com/RitaBot-Project/RitaBot/stargazers"">
</p><br/><br/>

#### 2. Create a new [Discord Application](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications) in the Discord Developer Portal
* Give app a friendly name and click the **Create App** button
  * I like the name **C-3PO**, but feel free to pick something different if you fear George Lucas's wrath. Maybe **C-4PO**
* Take note of the app **CLIENT ID**, you will need it later
* Scroll down to the **Bot** section
* Click the **Create a Bot User** button
* Click the **Yes, do it!** button
* Copy the bot's **TOKEN**, you will need it later

#### 3. Create a [Heroku account](https://id.heroku.com/signup/login) (It's free!)
* Create a new app. It's name must be unique and composed of all lowercase letters and dashes. Something like `yourname-discordbot` is fine
* Under **Deployment Method** select Github. Connect to your Github account and search for this repository by name.
* Scroll down to the manual deploy section, and select the **Master** branch. Click deploy branch, and wait for the successfully deployed message.

* Go to the **Resources** tab and look for the addons section. Search 'Postgres', and add a 'Hobby Dev - Free' version of Heroku Postgres. This will be automatically attached as your bot's database.
* Go to the **Settings** tab. Click to reveal Config Variables, then add then add the following:
  * **KEY:** =  DISCORD_TOKEN
    * **Value:** = Your discord bot's token that you copied earlier.
  * **KEY:** =  NODE_MODULES_CACHE
     * **Value:** = false
    * *This is to ensure that when the bot updates it does not use any old Dependencies that Heroku has stored and gets fresh ones from the package.json file*
* Go to the **Overview** tab and click configure dynos. Turn off the default `web npm start` dyno and turn on the `worker node src/bot.js` dyno. Your bot will now be up and running!


###### **Make sure that you have added the `Heroku Postgres` Addon in the Resources Tab of Heroku or else your bot shall not run!**

* *If you have any issues running your bot join our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/invite/mgNR64R)*
#### 4. Invite your bot to your server and configure it!
* Replace the CLIENTID string in the following URL with your own apps client id from Step 2: 
    *  **https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?&client_id=CLIENTID&scope=bot&permissions=8**
    
* Visit the resulting URL and add your bot to any server where you have admin privileges.
  * Once added, your bot should show in your server, **now go back to [Heroku](https://heroku.com/) and go to the ""Deploy"" section, scroll down to ""Manual Deploy"" and deploy the *master* branch. That's it your are good to go!**
    * Your bot is now setup and ready for any translation you have for it to do. Use the commands `!tr help` and `!tr help modules` to learn more about the commands Rita has!
  

* **Important Note**
 * The `!tr embed` command is changeable whenever you like. It simply decides wether you would like translations to be sent as Webhooks (more user-like, profile picture) or embed (bot sends message with anembed message contintaining user profile picture.)

## <a name=""update""></a>:floppy_disk: How to Update to Stable Branch on Heroku
#### 1. Checklist
* You must have a bot already running on your server, if not then refer to [Setting up a New Bot](#new-bot)

#### 2. Make a Pull Request to your Fork from this Repo
* Complete a Pull Request from the master Branch of RitaBot-Project/Rita to your master branch. 
  * Detailed instructions with example can be found **[here](https://www.sitepoint.com/quick-tip-sync-your-fork-with-the-original-without-the-cli/)**


#### 3. Deploy Updated Fork in Heroku
* Log in to your Heroku account.
* Select the bot you made in Step 3 of [Setting up a New Bot](#new-bot)
* Under **Deployment Method** make sure you have Github selected, ensure **Connect to GitHub** has the correct repository selected, Scroll down to the ""Manual deploY"" section, and select the **master** branch. Click deploy branch, and wait for the successfully deployed message.

#### 4. Updating Database

1. Install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/). It comes with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) which you will need.
2. Simply download this repository as a .zip, or clone it if you have git: **```git clone https://github.com/RitaBot-Project/RitaBot```**
3. In the RitaBot folder, rename the existing **.env.example** file and name it **.env**. Edit the Value of **DISCORD_TOKEN**. (If you don't have a bot account, see [Step 2 of ""Setting Up a New Bot""](#new-bot))
4. Open a terminal/console in the RitaBot folder and download dependencies using **`npm install`**
5. Start the bot with **`npm start`**
6. Invite your bot to your server and configure it!

* If you don't already have a invite for your bot, you can replace the **CLIENTID** string in the following URL with your own apps client id: https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?&client_id=**CLIENTID**&scope=bot&permissions=8 . Visit the resulting URL and add your bot to any server where you have admin privileges. Once added, your bot should show up as online.

* Your bot is now setup and ready for any translation you have for it to do. Use the commands `!tr help` and `!tr help modules` to learn more about the commands Rita has!

#### Alternative Database Settings
Any Database that runs with [SQL Sequelize](https://sequelize.org/master/) can be used. If you want to use an alternative DB Location other than in the default directory then you can manually set this. Example: The connection to a sqlite database with the name *`database.db`* stored at the same level of this README file would be *`./database.db`*.

Within the **.env** file from the above step, set the **DATABASE_URL** to be the path to the database file, if there is no DB file in the selected path then RITA will create the DB file upon startup.
* Example -  `DATABASE_URL` = `C:\Admin\Rita_Development\test.db`

## <a name=""database""></a>Heroku Database Support
Sometimes you need to edit the Database manually, This is not something you should be playing around with unless you really know what you are doing.

#### 1. Checklist
1. Know that you are doing, if you don't then **don't** touch the DB. Simple.
2. Download and Install Postgres Admin 4, Located [Here](https://www.pgadmin.org/download/) or [Here](https://www.postgresql.org/ftp/pgadmin/pgadmin4/). *This guide will be for Windows, but it shouldn't be much different for any other OS.*
3. Locate your credentials for you Heroku Database, Log in to **Heroku** > Select your **App** > Click **Resources** > Click **Heroku Postgres** > Click **Settings** > Click **View Credentials** (*Note: Heroku rotates credentials periodically and updates applications where this database is attached.*)

#### 2. Connect
For a fresh install of pgAdmin, the dashboard likely contains only one server. This is your local server, Ignore this.
1. Right click server(s) > create > server …
2. Fill out the following:
  * **Name:** This is solely for you. Name it whatever you want, I chose ‘Heroku-Run — On’

*Under the connection tab:*
  * **Hostname/Address:** This is the host credential you located in Step 3. It should look like \*\*-\*\*-\*\*...amazonaws.com
  * **Port:** Keep the port at 5432, unless your credentials list otherwise
  * **Maintenance database** This is the database name in the credentials
  * **Username:**  This is the user field in the credentials
  * **Password:** The password field located in Step 3. I highly advise checking save password so that you don’t have to copypasta this every time you want to connect.
  * In the **SSL Tab**, mark SSL mode as require

At this point, if we were to hit ‘save’ (please don’t), something very strange would happen. You’d see hundreds if not thousands of databases appear in pgAdmin. This has to do with how Heroku configures their servers. You’ll still only have access to your specific database, not those of others. In order to avoid parsing so many databases, we have to white list only those databases we care about.

1. Go to the **Advanced** tab and under db restriction copy the database name (it’s the same value as the **Maintenance Database** field filled earlier).
2. Click Save/Connect and you are done. Edit away.

### <a name=""credits-&-license""></a>:star_struck: Credits & License

This project was originally released by Aziz under the MIT license. He chose to take the project private/commercial at version 0.4.2 Beta. Bobby Johnson forked the project and renamed it Louie after his dog. AlooAkbar forked Louie and added the necessary modifications for simple and free deployment of the bot using Heroku. RitaBot-Project Picked up the fork and as part of a team fixed over 200 errors and brought it in to the modern age, All would like to thank Aziz for his hard work and making these early versions OSS so that others may learn and build on his hard work to share with the community.

### <a name=""history""></a>:yum: What is Rita and who are we?

*Rita is the culmination of many things, it started with a mobile game, a community of gamers, a discord server of different languages and a desire to all be understood. She is a Real-Time Translator Bot for use on Discord, Hosted using Heroku and Local Devices and Completly **100%** Free. She is maintained by a small group of users, each with different backgrounds and some learning as we go.*

------

#### :world_map: Why did you make Rita?

*The mobile game itself would get old, fast. The community around it, however, is what kept us going. The one downside was we didn't all speak the same language. The game we played translated our conversations for us but Discord didn't, so the server admins used a  translation bot called C-3P0. This introduction is the start of the story.*

------

#### :rocket: The history of Rita?

*There are loads of different translation bots out there, some are amazing, some are expensive, some are free but have limits, and others are just rubbish. C-3P0 checked all these boxes.*

*Originally called discord-translator and made by Aziz, then forked By NotMyself and renamed Louie, forked again By AlooAkbar and renamed C-3P0, its code was neglected, not maintained, left outdated and iterations made private for commercial gains.*

------

#### :star2: Why Rita and what does it stand for?

*I and a group of fellow C-3P0 users decided that collectively we could do better, plagued with crashes, API changes, relentless bugs and issues, the drive to make something better was born. Vast changes were made, many hours were spent and now the Rita you know was brought to life.*

*Rita's history and various iterations each added something extra, it just needed to be brought together and molded, molded into something amazing, moulded into Rita. The Real-Time Interchangeable Translating Assistant.*

------
###### *There you have it, the story, dramatised and electrified for effect, but all true, of how Rita was born.*

## What is Modmail?

Modmail is similar to Reddit's Modmail, both in functionality and purpose. It serves as a shared inbox for server staff to communicate with their users in a seamless way.

This bot is free for everyone and always will be. If you like this project and would like to show your appreciation, you can support us on **[Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/kyber)**, cool benefits included! 

## How does it work?

When a member sends a direct message to the bot, Modmail will create a channel or ""thread"" into a designated category. All further DM messages will automatically relay to that channel; any available staff can respond within the channel.

Our Logviewer will save the threads so you can view previous threads through their corresponding log link. Here is an [**example**](https://logs.modmail.dev/example).

## Features

* **Highly Customisable:**
  * Bot activity, prefix, category, log channel, etc.
  * Command permission system.
  * Interface elements (color, responses, reactions, etc.).
  * Snippets and *command aliases*.
  * Minimum duration for accounts to be created before allowed to contact Modmail (`account_age`).
  * Minimum length for members to be in the guild before allowed to contact Modmail (`guild_age`). 

* **Advanced Logging Functionality:**
  * When you close a thread, Modmail will generate a [log link](https://logs.modmail.dev/example) and post it to your log channel.
  * Native Discord dark-mode feel.
  * Markdown/formatting support.
  * Login via Discord to protect your logs ([premium Patreon feature](https://patreon.com/kyber)).
  * See past logs of a user with `?logs`.
  * Searchable by text queries using `?logs search`.

* **Robust implementation:**
  * Schedule tasks in human time, e.g. `?close in 2 hours silently`.
  * Editing and deleting messages are synced.
  * Support for the diverse range of message contents (multiple images, files).
  * Paginated commands interfaces via reactions.

This list is ever-growing thanks to active development and our exceptional contributors. See a full list of documented commands by using the `?help` command.

## Installation

Where can I find the Modmail bot invite link? 

Unfortunately, due to how this bot functions, it cannot be invited. The lack of an invite link is to ensure an individuality to your server and grant you full control over your bot and data. Nonetheless, you can quickly obtain a free copy of Modmail for your server by following one of the methods listed below (roughly takes 15 minutes of your time).

### Heroku

You can host this bot on Heroku.

Installation via Heroku is possible with your web browser alone. 
The [**installation guide**](https://github.com/kyb3r/modmail/wiki/Installation) (which includes a video tutorial!) will guide you through the entire installation process. If you run into any problems, join our [Modmail Discord Server](https://discord.gg/etJNHCQ) for help and support.

To configure automatic updates:
 - Login to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and verify your account.
 - [Fork the repo](https://github.com/kyb3r/modmail/fork).
 - Install the [Pull app](https://github.com/apps/pull) for your fork. 
 - Then go to the Deploy tab in your [Heroku account](https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps) of your bot app, select GitHub and connect your fork (usually by typing ""Modmail""). 
 - Turn on auto-deploy for the `master` branch.

### Hosting for Patreons

If you don't want to go through the trouble of setting up your very own Modmail bot or wish to support this project, we got a solution for you! We offer the complete installation, hosting, and maintenance of your Modmail with [**Patreon**](https://patreon.com/kyber). Join our [Modmail Discord Server](https://discord.gg/etJNHCQ) for more info! 

### Locally

Local hosting of Modmail is also possible. First, you will need [`Python 3.7`](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-376/).

Follow the [**installation guide**](https://github.com/kyb3r/modmail/wiki/Installation) and disregard deploying the Heroku bot application. If you run into any problems, join our [Modmail Discord Server](https://discord.gg/etJNHCQ) for help and support.

Clone the repo:

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/kyb3r/modmail
$ cd modmail
```

Install dependencies:

```console
$ pipenv install
```

Rename the `.env.example` to `.env` and fill out the fields. If `.env.example` is nonexistent (hidden), create a text file named `.env` and copy the contents of [`.env.example`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kyb3r/modmail/master/.env.example) then modify the values.

Finally, start Modmail.

```console
$ pipenv run bot
```

#### Docker

This repo supplies a Dockerfile for simplified deployment. 

You can build your own Docker image:

```console
$ docker build . --tag=modmail
```

Or run directly from a pre-built version from https://hub.docker.com/.

- Kyber's:

```console
$ docker pull kyb3rr/modmail
```

And to run your docker image:

```console
$ docker run --env-file .env kyb3rr/modmail
```
- `.env` should be the path to your env file; you can also supply a path: `/path/to/.env`.

# Using Service Accounts for uploading to avoid user rate limit
For Service Account to work, you must set `USE_SERVICE_ACCOUNTS` = ""True"" in config file or environment variables.
**NOTE**: Using Service Accounts is only recommended while uploading to a Team Drive.

## Generate Service Accounts. [What is Service Account](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-accounts)
<details>
    <summary><b>Click Here For More Details</b></summary>

Let us create only the Service Accounts that we need. 
**Warning**: abuse of this feature is not the aim of this project and we do **NOT** recommend that you make a lot of projects, just one project and 100 SAs allow you plenty of use, its also possible that over abuse might get your projects banned by Google. 

**NOTE:** 1 Service Account can copy around 750 GB a day, 1 project can make 100 Service Accounts so that's 75 TB a day, for most users this should easily suffice.
```
python3 gen_sa_accounts.py --quick-setup 1 --new-only
```
A folder named accounts will be created which will contain keys for the Service Accounts.

Or you can create Service Accounts to current project, no need to create new one

- List your projects ids
```
python3 gen_sa_accounts.py --list-projects
```
- Enable services automatically by this command
```
python3 gen_sa_accounts.py --enable-services $PROJECTID
```
- Create Sevice Accounts to current project
```
python3 gen_sa_accounts.py --create-sas $PROJECTID
```
- Download Sevice Accounts as accounts folder
```
python3 gen_sa_accounts.py --download-keys $PROJECTID
```
If you want to add Service Accounts to Google Group, follow these steps

- Mount accounts folder
```
cd accounts
```
- Grab emails form all accounts to emails.txt file that would be created in accounts folder
```
grep -oPh '""client_email"": ""\K[^""]+' *.json > emails.txt
```
- Unmount acounts folder
```
cd -
```
Then add emails from emails.txt to Google Group, after that add Google Group to your Shared Drive and promote it to manager.

**NOTE**: If you have created SAs in past from this script, you can also just re download the keys by running:
```
python3 gen_sa_accounts.py --download-keys project_id
```

</details>

## Add all the Service Accounts to the Team Drive
- Run:
```
python3 add_to_team_drive.py -d SharedTeamDriveSrcID
```

# Youtube-dl authentication using [.netrc](https://github.com/SlamDevs/slam-mirrorbot/blob/master/.netrc) file
For using your premium accounts in Youtube-dl or for protected Index Links, edit the netrc file according to following format:
```
machine host login username password my_youtube_password
```
For Index Link with only password without username, even http auth will not work, so this is the solution.
```
machine example.workers.dev password index_password
```
Where host is the name of extractor (eg. Youtube, Twitch). Multiple accounts of different hosts can be added each separated by a new line.

# Hubot

Hubot is a framework to build chat bots, modeled after GitHub's Campfire bot of the same name, hubot.
He's pretty cool. He's [extendable with scripts](http://hubot.github.com/docs/#scripts) and can work
on [many different chat services](https://hubot.github.com/docs/adapters/).

This repository provides a library that's distributed by `npm` that you
use for building your own bots.  See the [documentation](http://hubot.github.com/docs)
for details on getting up and running with your very own robot friend.

In most cases, you'll probably never have to hack on this repo directly if you
are building your own bot. But if you do, check out [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)

If you'd like to chat with Hubot users and developers, [join us on Slack](https://hubot-slackin.herokuapp.com/).

60,60,bottlerocket-os/bottlerocket,Rust,"# Bottlerocket OS

Welcome to Bottlerocket!

Bottlerocket is a free and open-source Linux-based operating system meant for hosting containers.

If you’re ready to jump right in, read one of our setup guides for running Bottlerocket in [Amazon EKS](QUICKSTART-EKS.md), [Amazon ECS](QUICKSTART-ECS.md), or [VMware](QUICKSTART-VMWARE.md).

Bottlerocket focuses on security and maintainability, providing a reliable, consistent, and safe platform for container-based workloads.
This is a reflection of what we've learned building operating systems and services at Amazon.
You can read more about what drives us in [our charter](CHARTER.md).

The base operating system has just what you need to run containers reliably, and is built with standard open-source components.
Bottlerocket-specific additions focus on reliable updates and on the API.
Instead of making configuration changes manually, you can change settings with an API call, and these changes are automatically migrated through updates.

Some notable features include:
* [API access](#api) for configuring your system, with secure out-of-band [access methods](#exploration) when you need them.
* [Updates](#updates) based on partition flips, for fast and reliable system updates.
* [Modeled configuration](#settings) that's automatically migrated through updates.
* [Security](#security) as a top priority.

## Contact us

If you find a security issue, please [contact our security team](https://github.com/bottlerocket-os/bottlerocket/security/policy) rather than opening an issue.

If you're interested in contributing, thank you!
Please see our [contributor's guide](CONTRIBUTING.md).

We use GitHub issues to track other bug reports and feature requests.
You can look at [existing issues](https://github.com/bottlerocket-os/bottlerocket/issues) to see whether your concern is already known.

If not, you can select from a few templates and get some guidance on the type of information that would be most helpful.
[Contact us with a new issue here.](https://github.com/bottlerocket-os/bottlerocket/issues/new/choose)

If you just have questions about Bottlerocket, please feel free to [start or join a discussion](https://github.com/bottlerocket-os/bottlerocket/discussions).

We don't have other communication channels set up quite yet, but don't worry about making an issue or a discussion thread!
You can let us know about things that seem difficult, or even ways you might like to help.

## Variants

To start, we're focusing on the use of Bottlerocket as a host OS in AWS EKS Kubernetes clusters and Amazon ECS clusters.
We’re excited to get early feedback and to continue working on more use cases!

Bottlerocket is architected such that different cloud environments and container orchestrators can be supported in the future.
A build of Bottlerocket that supports different features or integration characteristics is known as a 'variant'.
The artifacts of a build will include the architecture and variant name.
For example, an `x86_64` build of the `aws-k8s-1.21` variant will produce an image named `bottlerocket-aws-k8s-1.21-x86_64-<version>-<commit>.img`.

The following variants support EKS, as described above:

- `aws-k8s-1.18`
- `aws-k8s-1.19`
- `aws-k8s-1.20`
- `aws-k8s-1.21`
- `aws-k8s-1.21-nvidia`

The following variant supports ECS:

- `aws-ecs-1`

We also have variants in preview status that are designed to be Kubernetes worker nodes in VMware:

- `vmware-k8s-1.20`
- `vmware-k8s-1.21`

The `aws-k8s-1.15`, `aws-k8s-1.16`, and `aws-k8s-1.17` variants are no longer supported.
We recommend users replace nodes running these variants with the [latest variant compatible with their cluster](variants/).

## Architectures

Our supported architectures include `x86_64` and `aarch64` (written as `arm64` in some contexts).

## Setup

:walking: :running:

Bottlerocket is best used with a container orchestrator.
To get started with Kubernetes in Amazon EKS, please see [QUICKSTART-EKS](QUICKSTART-EKS.md).
To get started with Kubernetes in VMware, please see [QUICKSTART-VMWARE](QUICKSTART-VMWARE.md).
To get started with Amazon ECS, please see [QUICKSTART-ECS](QUICKSTART-ECS.md).
These guides describe:
* how to set up a cluster with the orchestrator, so your Bottlerocket instance can run containers
* how to launch a Bottlerocket instance in EC2 or VMware

To build your own Bottlerocket images, please see [BUILDING](BUILDING.md).
It describes:
* how to build an image
* how to register an EC2 AMI from an image

To publish your built Bottlerocket images, please see [PUBLISHING](PUBLISHING.md).
It describes:
* how to make TUF repos including your image

## Exploration

To improve security, there's no SSH server in a Bottlerocket image, and not even a shell.

Don't panic!

There are a couple out-of-band access methods you can use to explore Bottlerocket like you would a typical Linux system.
Either option will give you a shell within Bottlerocket.
From there, you can [change settings](#settings), manually [update Bottlerocket](#updates), debug problems, and generally explore.

**Note:** These methods require that your instance has permission to access the ECR repository where these containers live; the appropriate policy to add to your instance's IAM role is `AmazonEC2ContainerRegistryReadOnly`.

### Control container

Bottlerocket has a [""control"" container](https://github.com/bottlerocket-os/bottlerocket-control-container), enabled by default, that runs outside of the orchestrator in a separate instance of containerd.
This container runs the [AWS SSM agent](https://github.com/aws/amazon-ssm-agent) that lets you run commands, or start shell sessions, on Bottlerocket instances in EC2.
(You can easily replace this control container with your own just by changing the URI; see [Settings](#settings).)

In AWS, you need to give your instance the SSM role for this to work; see the [setup guide](QUICKSTART-EKS.md#enabling-ssm).
Outside of AWS, you can use [AWS Systems Manager for hybrid environments](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-managedinstances.html).
There's more detail about hybrid environments in the [control container documentation](https://github.com/bottlerocket-os/bottlerocket-control-container/#connecting-to-aws-systems-manager-ssm).

Once the instance is started, you can start a session:

* Go to AWS SSM's [Session Manager](https://console.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/session-manager/sessions)
* Select ""Start session"" and choose your Bottlerocket instance
* Select ""Start session"" again to get a shell

If you prefer a command-line tool, you can start a session with a recent [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) and the [session-manager-plugin](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/session-manager-working-with-install-plugin.html).
Then you'd be able to start a session using only your instance ID, like this:

```
aws ssm start-session --target INSTANCE_ID
```

With the [default control container](https://github.com/bottlerocket-os/bottlerocket-control-container), you can make [API calls](#api) to configure and manage your Bottlerocket host.
To do even more, read the next section about the [admin container](#admin-container).
If you've enabled the admin container, you can access it from the control container like this:

```
apiclient exec admin bash
```

### Admin container

Bottlerocket has an [administrative container](https://github.com/bottlerocket-os/bottlerocket-admin-container), disabled by default, that runs outside of the orchestrator in a separate instance of containerd.
This container has an SSH server that lets you log in as `ec2-user` using your EC2-registered SSH key.
Outside of AWS, you can [pass in your own SSH keys](https://github.com/bottlerocket-os/bottlerocket-admin-container#authenticating-with-the-admin-container).
(You can easily replace this admin container with your own just by changing the URI; see [Settings](#settings).

To enable the container, you can change the setting in user data when starting Bottlerocket, for example EC2 instance user data:

```
[settings.host-containers.admin]
enabled = true
```

If Bottlerocket is already running, you can enable the admin container from the default [control container](#control-container) like this:

```
enable-admin-container
```

If you're using a custom control container, or want to make the API calls directly, you can enable the admin container like this instead:

```
apiclient set host-containers.admin.enabled=true
```

Once you've enabled the admin container, you can either access it through SSH or from the control container like this:

```
apiclient exec admin bash
```

Once you're in the admin container, you can run `sheltie` to get a full root shell in the Bottlerocket host.
Be careful; while you can inspect and change even more as root, Bottlerocket's filesystem and dm-verity setup will prevent most changes from persisting over a restart - see [Security](#security).

## Updates

Rather than a package manager that updates individual pieces of software, Bottlerocket downloads a full filesystem image and reboots into it.
It can automatically roll back if boot failures occur, and workload failures can trigger manual rollbacks.

The update process uses images secured by [TUF](https://theupdateframework.github.io/).
For more details, see the [update system documentation](sources/updater/).

### Update methods

There are several ways of updating your Bottlerocket hosts.
We provide tools for automatically updating hosts, as well as an API for direct control of updates.

#### Automated updates

For EKS variants of Bottlerocket, we recommend using the [Bottlerocket update operator](https://github.com/bottlerocket-os/bottlerocket-update-operator) for automated updates.

For the ECS variant of Bottlerocket, we recommend using the [Bottlerocket ECS updater](https://github.com/bottlerocket-os/bottlerocket-ecs-updater/) for automated updates.

#### Update API

The [Bottlerocket API](#api) includes methods for checking and starting system updates.
You can read more about the update APIs in our [update system documentation](sources/updater/README.md#update-api).

apiclient knows how to handle those update APIs for you, and you can run it from the [control](#control-container) or [admin](#admin-container) containers.

To see what updates are available:
```
apiclient update check
```
If an update is available, it will show up in the `chosen_update` field.
The `available_updates` field will show the full list of available versions, including older versions, because Bottlerocket supports safely rolling back.

To apply the latest update:
```
apiclient update apply
```

The next time you reboot, you'll start up in the new version, and system configuration will be automatically [migrated](sources/api/migration/).
To reboot right away:
```
apiclient reboot
```

If you're confident about updating, the `apiclient update apply` command has `--check` and `--reboot` flags to combine the above actions, so you can accomplish all of the above steps like this:
```
apiclient update apply --check --reboot
```

See the [apiclient documentation](sources/api/apiclient/) for more details.

### Update rollback

The system will automatically roll back if it's unable to boot.
If the update is not functional for a given container workload, you can do a manual rollback:

```
signpost rollback-to-inactive
reboot
```

This doesn't require any external communication, so it's quicker than `apiclient`, and it's made to be as reliable as possible.

## Settings

Here we'll describe the settings you can configure on your Bottlerocket instance, and how to do it.

(API endpoints are defined in our [OpenAPI spec](sources/api/openapi.yaml) if you want more detail.)

### Interacting with settings

#### Using the API client

You can see the current settings with an API request:
```
apiclient get settings
```

This will return all of the current settings in JSON format.
For example, here's an abbreviated response:
```
{""motd"":""..."", {""kubernetes"": ...}}
```

You can change settings like this:
```
apiclient set motd=""hi there"" kubernetes.node-labels.environment=test
```

You can also use a JSON input mode to help change many related settings at once, and a ""raw"" mode if you want more control over how the settings are committed and applied to the system.
See the [apiclient README](sources/api/apiclient/) for details.

#### Using user data

If you know what settings you want to change when you start your Bottlerocket instance, you can send them in the user data.

In user data, we structure the settings in TOML form to make things a bit simpler.
Here's the user data to change the message of the day setting, as we did in the last section:

```
[settings]
motd = ""my own value!""
```

If your user data is over the size limit of the platform (e.g. 16KiB for EC2) you can compress the contents with gzip.
(With [aws-cli](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/), you can use `--user-data fileb:///path/to/gz-file` to pass binary data.)

### Description of settings

Here we'll describe each setting you can change.

**Note:** You can see the default values (for any settings that are not generated at runtime) by looking in the `defaults.d` directory for a variant, for example [aws-ecs-1](sources/models/src/aws-ecs-1/defaults.d/).

When you're sending settings to the API, or receiving settings from the API, they're in a structured JSON format.
This allows modification of any number of keys at once.
It also lets us ensure that they fit the definition of the Bottlerocket data model - requests with invalid settings won't even parse correctly, helping ensure safety.

Here, however, we'll use the shortcut ""dotted key"" syntax for referring to keys.
This is used in some API endpoints with less-structured requests or responses.
It's also more compact for our needs here.

In this format, ""settings.kubernetes.cluster-name"" refers to the same key as in the JSON `{""settings"": {""kubernetes"": {""cluster-name"": ""value""}}}`.

#### Top-level settings

* `settings.motd`: This setting is just written out to /etc/motd. It's useful as a way to get familiar with the API!  Try changing it.

#### Kubernetes settings

See the [EKS setup guide](QUICKSTART-EKS.md) for much more detail on setting up Bottlerocket and Kubernetes in AWS EKS.
For more details about running Bottlerocket as a Kubernetes worker node in VMware, see the [VMware setup guide](QUICKSTART-VMWARE.md).

The following settings must be specified in order to join a Kubernetes cluster.
You should [specify them in user data](#using-user-data).
* `settings.kubernetes.cluster-certificate`: This is the base64-encoded certificate authority of the cluster.
* `settings.kubernetes.api-server`: This is the cluster's Kubernetes API endpoint.

For Kubernetes variants in AWS, you must also specify:
* `settings.kubernetes.cluster-name`: The cluster name you chose during setup; the [setup guide](QUICKSTART-EKS.md) uses ""bottlerocket"".

For Kubernetes variants in VMware, you must specify:
* `settings.kubernetes.cluster-dns-ip`: The IP of the DNS service running in the cluster.
* `settings.kubernetes.bootstrap-token`: The token used for [TLS bootstrapping](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kubelet-tls-bootstrapping/).

The following settings can be optionally set to customize the node labels and taints. Remember to quote keys (since they often contain ""."") and to quote all values.
* `settings.kubernetes.node-labels`: [Labels](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/) in the form of key, value pairs added when registering the node in the cluster.
* `settings.kubernetes.node-taints`: [Taints](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/taint-and-toleration/) in the form of key, values and effects entries added when registering the node in the cluster.
  * Example user data for setting up labels and taints:
    ```
    [settings.kubernetes.node-labels]
    ""label1"" = ""foo""
    ""label2"" = ""bar""
    [settings.kubernetes.node-taints]
    ""dedicated"" = [""experimental:PreferNoSchedule"", ""experimental:NoExecute""]
    ""special"" = [""true:NoSchedule""]
    ```

The following settings are optional and allow you to further configure your cluster.
* `settings.kubernetes.cluster-domain`: The DNS domain for this cluster, allowing all Kubernetes-run containers to search this domain before the host's search domains.  Defaults to `cluster.local`.
* `settings.kubernetes.standalone-mode`: Whether to run the kubelet in standalone mode, without connecting to an API server.  Defaults to `false`.
* `settings.kubernetes.cloud-provider`: The cloud provider for this cluster. Defaults to `aws` for AWS variants, and `external` for other variants.
* `settings.kubernetes.authentication-mode`: Which authentication method the kubelet should use to connect to the API server, and for incoming requests.  Defaults to `aws` for AWS variants, and `tls` for other variants.
* `settings.kubernetes.server-tls-bootstrap`: Enables or disables server certificate bootstrap.  When enabled, the kubelet will request a certificate from the certificates.k8s.io API.  This requires an approver to approve the certificate signing requests (CSR).  Defaults to `true`.
* `settings.kubernetes.bootstrap-token`: The token to use for [TLS bootstrapping](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kubelet-tls-bootstrapping/).  This is only used with the `tls` authentication mode, and is otherwise ignored.
* `settings.kubernetes.eviction-hard`: The signals and thresholds that trigger pod eviction.
  Remember to quote signals (since they all contain ""."") and to quote all values.
  * Example user data for setting up eviction hard:
    ```
    [settings.kubernetes.eviction-hard]
    ""memory.available"" = ""15%""
    ```
* `settings.kubernetes.allowed-unsafe-sysctls`: Enables specified list of unsafe sysctls.
  * Example user data for setting up allowed unsafe sysctls:
    ```
    allowed-unsafe-sysctls = [""net.core.somaxconn"", ""net.ipv4.ip_local_port_range""]
    ```
* `settings.kubernetes.system-reserved`: Resources reserved for system components.
  * Example user data for setting up system reserved:
    ```
    [settings.kubernetes.system-reserved]
    cpu = ""10m""
    memory = ""100Mi""
    ephemeral-storage= ""1Gi""
    ```
* `settings.kubernetes.registry-qps`: The registry pull QPS.
* `settings.kubernetes.registry-burst`: The maximum size of bursty pulls.
* `settings.kubernetes.event-qps`: The maximum event creations per second.
* `settings.kubernetes.event-burst`: The maximum size of a burst of event creations.
* `settings.kubernetes.kube-api-qps`: The QPS to use while talking with kubernetes apiserver.
* `settings.kubernetes.kube-api-burst`: The burst to allow while talking with kubernetes.
* `settings.kubernetes.container-log-max-size`: The maximum size of container log file before it is rotated.
* `settings.kubernetes.container-log-max-files`: The maximum number of container log files that can be present for a container.
* `settings.kubernetes.cpu-manager-policy`: Specifies the CPU manager policy. Possible values are `static` and `none`. Defaults to `none`. If you want to allow pods with certain resource characteristics to be granted increased CPU affinity and exclusivity on the node, you can set this setting to `static`. You should reboot if you change this setting after startup - try `apiclient reboot`.
* `settings.kubernetes.cpu-manager-reconcile-period`: Specifies the CPU manager reconcile period, which controls how often updated CPU assignments are written to cgroupfs. The value is a duration like `30s` for 30 seconds or `1h5m` for 1 hour and 5 minutes.
* `settings.kubernetes.topology-manager-policy`: Specifies the topology manager policy. Possible values are `none`, `restricted`, `best-effort`, and `single-numa-node`. Defaults to `none`.
* `settings.kubernetes.topology-manager-scope`: Specifies the topology manager scope. Possible values are `container` and `pod`. Defaults to `container`. If you want to group all containers in a pod to a common set of NUMA nodes, you can set this setting to `pod`.

You can also optionally specify static pods for your node with the following settings.
Static pods can be particularly useful when running in standalone mode.
* `settings.kubernetes.static-pods.<custom identifier>.manifest`: A base64-encoded pod manifest.
* `settings.kubernetes.static-pods.<custom identifier>.enabled`: Whether the static pod is enabled.

For Kubernetes variants in AWS and VMware, the following are set for you automatically, but you can override them if you know what you're doing!
In AWS, [pluto](sources/api/) sets these based on runtime instance information.
In VMware, Bottlerocket uses [netdog](sources/api/) (for `node-ip`) or relies on [default values](sources/models/src/vmware-k8s-1.21/defaults.d/).
* `settings.kubernetes.node-ip`: The IP address of this node.
* `settings.kubernetes.pod-infra-container-image`: The URI of the ""pause"" container.
* `settings.kubernetes.kube-reserved`: Resources reserved for node components.
  * Bottlerocket provides default values for the resources by [schnauzer](sources/api/):
    * `cpu`: in millicores from the total number of vCPUs available on the instance.
    * `memory`: in mebibytes from the max num of pods on the instance. `memory_to_reserve = max_num_pods * 11 + 255`.
    * `ephemeral-storage`: defaults to `1Gi`.

For Kubernetes variants in AWS, the following settings are set for you automatically by [pluto](sources/api/).
* `settings.kubernetes.max-pods`: The maximum number of pods that can be scheduled on this node (limited by number of available IPv4 addresses)
* `settings.kubernetes.cluster-dns-ip`: Derived from the EKS Service IP CIDR or the CIDR block of the primary network interface.

#### Amazon ECS settings

See the [setup guide](QUICKSTART-ECS.md) for much more detail on setting up Bottlerocket and ECS.

The following settings are optional and allow you to configure how your instance joins an ECS cluster.
Since joining a cluster happens at startup, they need to be [specified in user data](#using-user-data).
* `settings.ecs.cluster`: The name or [ARN](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html) of your Amazon ECS cluster.
  If left unspecified, Bottlerocket will join your `default` cluster.
* `settings.ecs.instance-attributes`: [Attributes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task-placement-constraints.html#attributes) in the form of key, value pairs added when registering the container instance in the cluster.
  * Example user data for setting up attributes:
    ```
    [settings.ecs.instance-attributes]
    attribute1 = ""foo""
    attribute2 = ""bar""
    ```

The following settings are optional and allow you to further configure your cluster.
These settings can be changed at any time.
* `settings.ecs.logging-drivers`: The list of logging drivers available on the container instance.
  The ECS agent running on a container instance must register available logging drivers before tasks that use those drivers are eligible to be placed on the instance.
  Bottlerocket enables the `json-file`, `awslogs`, and `none` drivers by default.
* `settings.ecs.allow-privileged-containers`: Whether launching privileged containers is allowed on the container instance.
  If this value is set to false, privileged containers are not permitted.
  Bottlerocket sets this value to false by default.
* `settings.ecs.loglevel`: The level of verbosity for the ECS agent's logs.
  Supported values are `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`, and `crit`, and the default is `info`.
* `settings.ecs.enable-spot-instance-draining`: If the instance receives a spot termination notice, the agent will set the instance's state to `DRAINING`, so the workload can be moved gracefully before the instance is removed. Defaults to `false`.

#### OCI Hooks settings

Bottlerocket allows you to opt-in to use additional [OCI hooks](https://github.com/opencontainers/runtime-spec/blob/main/runtime.md#lifecycle) for your orchestrated containers.
Once you opt-in to use additional OCI hooks, any new orchestrated containers will be configured with them, but existing containers won't be changed.

* `settings.oci-hooks.log4j-hotpatch-enabled`: Enables the [hotdog OCI hooks](https://github.com/bottlerocket-os/hotdog), which are used to inject the [Log4j Hot Patch](https://github.com/corretto/hotpatch-for-apache-log4j2) into containers. Defaults to `false`.

#### Container image registry settings

The following setting is optional and allows you to configure image registry mirrors and pull-through caches for your containers.
* `settings.container-registry.mirrors`: An array of container image registry mirror settings.  Each element specifies the registry and the endpoints for said registry.
When pulling an image from a registry, the container runtime will try the endpoints one by one and use the first working one.
  (Docker and containerd will still try the default registry URL if the mirrors fail.)
  * Example user data for setting up image registry mirrors:
  ```
  [[settings.container-registry.mirrors]]
  registry = ""*""
  endpoint = [""https://<example-mirror>"",""https://<example-mirror-2>""]

  [[settings.container-registry.mirrors]]
  registry = ""docker.io""
  endpoint = [ ""https://<my-docker-hub-mirror-host>"", ""https://<my-docker-hub-mirror-host-2>""]
  ```
  If you use a Bottlerocket variant that uses Docker as the container runtime, like `aws-ecs-1`, you should be aware that Docker only supports pull-through caches for images from Docker Hub (docker.io).  Mirrors for other registries are ignored in this case.

For [host-container](#host-containers-settings) and [bootstrap-container](#bootstrap-containers-settings) images from Amazon ECR private repositories, registry mirrors are currently unsupported.

#### Updates settings

* `settings.updates.metadata-base-url`: The common portion of all URIs used to download update metadata.
* `settings.updates.targets-base-url`: The common portion of all URIs used to download update files.
* `settings.updates.seed`: A `u32` value that determines how far into the update schedule this machine will accept an update.  We recommend leaving this at its default generated value so that updates can be somewhat randomized in your cluster.
* `settings.updates.version-lock`: Controls the version that will be selected when you issue an update request.  Can be locked to a specific version like `v1.0.0`, or `latest` to take the latest available version.  Defaults to `latest`.
* `settings.updates.ignore-waves`: Updates are rolled out in waves to reduce the impact of issues.  For testing purposes, you can set this to `true` to ignore those waves and update immediately.

#### Network settings

* `settings.network.hostname`: The desired hostname of the system.
  **Important note for all Kubernetes variants:** Changing this setting at runtime (not via user data) can cause issues with kubelet registration, as hostname is closely tied to the identity of the system for both registration and certificates/authorization purposes.

Most users don't need to change this setting as the following defaults work for the majority of use cases.
If this setting isn't set we attempt to use DNS reverse lookup for the hostname.
If the lookup is unsuccessful, the IP of the node is used.

##### Proxy settings

These settings will configure the proxying behavior of the following services:
* For all variants:
    * [containerd.service](packages/containerd/containerd.service)
    * [host-containerd.service](packages/host-ctr/host-containerd.service)
* For Kubernetes variants:
    * [kubelet.service](packages/kubernetes-1.18/kubelet.service)
* For the ECS variant:
    * [docker.service](packages/docker-engine/docker.service)
    * [ecs.service](packages/ecs-agent/ecs.service)

* `settings.network.https-proxy`: The HTTPS proxy server to be used by services listed above.
* `settings.network.no-proxy`: A list of hosts that are excluded from proxying.  
   Example: 
   ```
   [settings.network]
   https-proxy = ""1.2.3.4:8080""
   no-proxy = [""localhost"", ""127.0.0.1""]
   ```

The no-proxy list will automatically include entries for localhost.

If you're running a Kubernetes variant, the no-proxy list will automatically include the Kubernetes API server endpoint and other commonly used Kubernetes DNS suffixes to facilitate intra-cluster networking.

#### Metrics settings

By default, Bottlerocket sends anonymous metrics when it boots, and once every six hours.
This can be disabled by setting `send-metrics` to false.
Here are the metrics settings:

* `settings.metrics.metrics-url`: The endpoint to which metrics will be sent. The default is `https://metrics.bottlerocket.aws/v1/metrics`.
* `settings.metrics.send-metrics`: Whether Bottlerocket will send anonymous metrics.
* `settings.metrics.service-checks`: A list of systemd services that will be checked to determine whether a host is healthy.

#### Time settings

* `settings.ntp.time-servers`: A list of NTP servers used to set and verify the system time.

#### Kernel settings

* `settings.kernel.lockdown`: This allows further restrictions on what the Linux kernel will allow, for example preventing the loading of unsigned modules.
  May be set to ""none"" (the default in older [variants](variants/), up through aws-k8s-1.19), ""integrity"" (the default for newer [variants](variants/)), or ""confidentiality"".
  **Important note:** this setting cannot be lowered (toward 'none') at runtime.
  You must reboot for a change to a lower level to take effect.
* `settings.kernel.sysctl`: Key/value pairs representing Linux kernel parameters.
  Remember to quote keys (since they often contain ""."") and to quote all values.
  * Example user data for setting up sysctl:
    ```
    [settings.kernel.sysctl]
    ""user.max_user_namespaces"" = ""16384""
    ""vm.max_map_count"" = ""262144""
    ```

#### Custom CA certificates settings

By default, Bottlerocket ships with the Mozilla CA certificate store, but you can add self-signed certificates through the API using these settings:

* `settings.pki.<bundle-name>.data`: Base64-encoded PEM-formatted certificates bundle; it can contain more than one certificate
* `settings.pki.<bundle-name>.trusted`: Whether the certificates in the bundle are trusted; defaults to `false` when not provided

Here's an example of adding a bundle of self-signed certificates as user data:

```toml
[settings.pki.my-trusted-bundle]
data=""W3N...""
trusted=true

[settings.pki.dont-trust-these]
data=""W3N...""
trusted=false
```

Here's the same example but using API calls:

```sh
apiclient set \
  pki.my-trusted-bundle.data=""W3N..."" \
  pki.my-trusted-bundle.trusted=true  \
  pki.dont-trust-these.data=""N3W...""  \
  pki.dont-trust-there.trusted=false
```

You can use this method from within a [bootstrap container](#bootstrap-containers-settings), if your user data is over the size limit of the platform.

#### Host containers settings
* `settings.host-containers.admin.source`: The URI of the [admin container](#admin-container).
* `settings.host-containers.admin.enabled`: Whether the admin container is enabled.
* `settings.host-containers.admin.superpowered`: Whether the admin container has high levels of access to the Bottlerocket host.
* `settings.host-containers.control.source`: The URI of the [control container](#control-container).
* `settings.host-containers.control.enabled`: Whether the control container is enabled.
* `settings.host-containers.control.superpowered`: Whether the control container has high levels of access to the Bottlerocket host.

##### Custom host containers

[`admin`](https://github.com/bottlerocket-os/bottlerocket-admin-container) and [`control`](https://github.com/bottlerocket-os/bottlerocket-control-container) are our default host containers, but you're free to change this.
Beyond just changing the settings above to affect the `admin` and `control` containers, you can add and remove host containers entirely.
As long as you define the three fields above -- `source` with a URI, and `enabled` and `superpowered` with true/false -- you can add host containers with an API call or user data.

You can optionally define a `user-data` field with arbitrary base64-encoded data, which will be made available in the container at `/.bottlerocket/host-containers/$HOST_CONTAINER_NAME/user-data` and (since Bottlerocket v1.0.8) `/.bottlerocket/host-containers/current/user-data`.
(It was inspired by instance user data, but is entirely separate; it can be any data your host container feels like interpreting.)

Keep in mind that the default admin container (since Bottlerocket v1.0.6) relies on `user-data` to store SSH keys.  You can set `user-data` to [customize the keys](https://github.com/bottlerocket-os/bottlerocket-admin-container/#authenticating-with-the-admin-container), or you can use it for your own purposes in a custom container.

Here's an example of adding a custom host container with API calls:
```
apiclient set \
   host-containers.custom.source=MY-CONTAINER-URI \
   host-containers.custom.enabled=true \
   host-containers.custom.superpowered=false
```

Here's the same example, but with the settings you'd add to user data:
```
[settings.host-containers.custom]
enabled = true
source = ""MY-CONTAINER-URI""
superpowered = false
```

If the `enabled` flag is `true`, it will be started automatically.

All host containers will have the `apiclient` binary available at `/usr/local/bin/apiclient` so they're able to [interact with the API](#using-the-api-client).
You can also use `apiclient` to run programs in other host containers.
For example, to access the admin container:

```
apiclient exec admin bash
```

In addition, all host containers come with persistent storage that survives reboots and container start/stop cycles.
It's available at `/.bottlerocket/host-containers/$HOST_CONTAINER_NAME` and (since Bottlerocket v1.0.8) `/.bottlerocket/host-containers/current`.
The default `admin` host-container, for example, stores its SSH host keys under `/.bottlerocket/host-containers/admin/etc/ssh/`.

There are a few important caveats to understand about host containers:
* They're not orchestrated.  They only start or stop according to that `enabled` flag.
* They run in a separate instance of containerd than the one used for orchestrated containers like Kubernetes pods.
* They're not updated automatically.  You need to update the `source` and commit those changes.
* If you set `superpowered` to true, they'll essentially have root access to the host.

Because of these caveats, host containers are only intended for special use cases.
We use them for the control container because it needs to be available early to give you access to the OS, and for the admin container because it needs high levels of privilege and because you need it to debug when orchestration isn't working.

Be careful, and make sure you have a similar low-level use case before reaching for host containers.

#### Bootstrap containers settings
* `settings.bootstrap-containers.<name>.source`: the image for the container
* `settings.bootstrap-containers.<name>.mode`: the mode of the container, it could be one of `off`, `once` or `always`. See below for a description of modes.
* `settings.bootstrap-containers.<name>.essential`: whether or not the container should fail the boot process, defaults to `false`
* `settings.bootstrap-containers.<name>.user-data`: field with arbitrary base64-encoded data

Bootstrap containers are host containers that can be used to ""bootstrap"" the host before services like ECS Agent, Kubernetes, and Docker start.

Bootstrap containers are very similar to normal host containers; they come with persistent storage and with optional user data.
Unlike normal host containers, bootstrap containers can't be treated as `superpowered` containers.
However, bootstrap containers do have additional permissions that normal host containers do not have.
Bootstrap containers have access to the underlying root filesystem on `/.bottlerocket/rootfs` as well as to all the devices in the host, and they are set up with the `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` capability.
This allows bootstrap containers to create files, directories, and mounts that are visible to the host.

Bootstrap containers are set up to run after the systemd `configured.target` unit is active.
The containers' systemd unit depends on this target (and not on any of the bootstrap containers' peers) which means that bootstrap containers will not execute in a deterministic order.
The boot process will ""wait"" for as long as the bootstrap containers run.
Bootstrap containers configured with `essential=true` will stop the boot process if they exit code is a non-zero value.

Bootstrap containers have three different modes:

* `always`: with this setting, the container is executed on every boot.
* `off`: the container won't run
* `once`: with this setting, the container only runs on the first boot where the container is defined. Upon completion, the mode is changed to `off`.

Here's an example of adding a bootstrap container with API calls:

```
apiclient set \
   bootstrap-containers.bootstrap.source=MY-CONTAINER-URI \
   bootstrap-containers.bootstrap.mode=once \
   bootstrap-containers.bootstrap.essential=true
```

Here's the same example, but with the settings you'd add to user data:

```
[settings.bootstrap-containers.bootstrap]
source = ""MY-CONTAINER-URI""
mode = ""once""
essential = true
```

##### Mount propagations in bootstrap and superpowered containers
Both bootstrap and superpowered host containers are configured with the `/.bottlerocket/rootfs/mnt` bind mount that points to `/mnt` in the host, which itself is a bind mount of `/local/mnt`.
This bind mount is set up with shared propagations, so any new mount point created underneath `/.bottlerocket/rootfs/mnt` in any bootstrap or superpowered host container will propagate across mount namespaces.
You can use this feature to configure ephemeral disks attached to your hosts that you may want to use on your workloads.

#### Platform-specific settings

Platform-specific settings are automatically set at boot time by [early-boot-config](sources/api/early-boot-config) based on metadata available on the running platform.
They can be overridden for testing purposes in [the same way as other settings](#interacting-with-settings).

##### AWS-specific settings

AWS-specific settings are automatically set based on calls to the Instance MetaData Service (IMDS).

* `settings.aws.region`: This is set to the AWS region in which the instance is running, for example `us-west-2`.

### Logs

You can use `logdog` through the [admin container](#admin-container) to obtain an archive of log files from your Bottlerocket host.
SSH to the Bottlerocket host or `apiclient exec admin bash` to access the admin container, then run:

```bash
sudo sheltie
logdog
```

This will write an archive of the logs to `/var/log/support/bottlerocket-logs.tar.gz`.
You can use SSH to retrieve the file.
Once you have exited from the Bottlerocket host, run a command like:

```bash
ssh -i YOUR_KEY_FILE \
    ec2-user@YOUR_HOST \
    ""cat /.bottlerocket/rootfs/var/log/support/bottlerocket-logs.tar.gz"" > bottlerocket-logs.tar.gz
```

(If your instance isn't accessible through SSH, you can use [SSH over SSM](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/session-manager-getting-started-enable-ssh-connections.html).)

For a list of what is collected, see the logdog [command list](sources/logdog/src/log_request.rs).

### Kdump Support

Bottlerocket provides support to collect kernel crash dumps whenever the system kernel panics.
Once this happens, both the dmesg log and vmcore dump are stored at `/var/log/kdump`, and the system reboots.

There are a few important caveats about the provided kdump support:

* Currently, only vmware variants have kdump support enabled
* The system kernel will reserve 256MB for the crash kernel, only when the host has at least 2GB of memory; the reserved space won't be available for processes running in the host
* The crash kernel will only be loaded when the `crashkernel` parameter is present in the kernel's cmdline and if there is memory reserved for it

## Details

### Security

:shield: :crab:

To learn more about security features in Bottlerocket, please see [SECURITY FEATURES](SECURITY_FEATURES.md).
It describes how we use features like [dm-verity](https://gitlab.com/cryptsetup/cryptsetup/wikis/DMVerity) and [SELinux](https://selinuxproject.org/) to protect the system from security threats.

To learn more about security recommendations for Bottlerocket, please see [SECURITY GUIDANCE](SECURITY_GUIDANCE.md).
It documents additional steps you can take to secure the OS, and includes resources such as a [Pod Security Policy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/pod-security-policy/) for your reference.

In addition, almost all first-party components are written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).
Rust eliminates some classes of memory safety issues, and encourages design patterns that help security.

### Packaging

Bottlerocket is built from source using a container toolchain.
We use RPM package definitions to build and install individual packages into an image.
RPM itself is not in the image - it's just a common and convenient package definition format.

We currently package the following major third-party components:
* Linux kernel ([background](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux), [packaging](packages/kernel-5.4/))
* glibc ([background](https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/), [packaging](packages/glibc/))
* Buildroot as build toolchain ([background](https://buildroot.org/), via the [SDK](https://github.com/bottlerocket-os/bottlerocket-sdk))
* GRUB, with patches for partition flip updates ([background](https://www.gnu.org/software/grub/), [packaging](packages/grub/))
* systemd as init ([background](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemd), [packaging](packages/systemd/))
* wicked for networking ([background](https://github.com/openSUSE/wicked), [packaging](packages/wicked/))
* containerd ([background](https://containerd.io/), [packaging](packages/containerd/))
* Kubernetes ([background](https://kubernetes.io/), [packaging](packages/kubernetes-1.21/))
* aws-iam-authenticator ([background](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/aws-iam-authenticator), [packaging](packages/aws-iam-authenticator/))
* Amazon ECS agent ([background](https://github.com/aws/amazon-ecs-agent), [packaging](packages/ecs-agent/))

For further documentation or to see the rest of the packages, see the [packaging directory](packages/).

### Updates

The Bottlerocket image has two identical sets of partitions, A and B.
When updating Bottlerocket, the partition table is updated to point from set A to set B, or vice versa.

We also track successful boots, and if there are failures it will automatically revert back to the prior working partition set.

The update process uses images secured by [TUF](https://theupdateframework.github.io/).
For more details, see the [update system documentation](sources/updater/).

### API

There are two main ways you'd interact with a production Bottlerocket instance.
(There are a couple more [exploration](#exploration) methods above for test instances.)

The first method is through a container orchestrator, for when you want to run or manage containers.
This uses the standard channel for your orchestrator, for example a tool like `kubectl` for Kubernetes.

The second method is through the Bottlerocket API, for example when you want to configure the system.

There's an HTTP API server that listens on a local Unix-domain socket.
Remote access to the API requires an authenticated transport such as SSM's RunCommand or Session Manager, as described above.
For more details, see the [apiserver documentation](sources/api/apiserver/).

The [apiclient](sources/api/apiclient/) can be used to make requests.
They're just HTTP requests, but the API client simplifies making requests with the Unix-domain socket.

To make configuration easier, we have [early-boot-config](sources/api/early-boot-config/), which can send an API request for you based on instance user data.
If you start a virtual machine, like an EC2 instance, it will read TOML-formatted Bottlerocket configuration from user data and send it to the API server.
This way, you can configure your Bottlerocket instance without having to make API calls after launch.

See [Settings](#settings) above for examples and to understand what you can configure.

You can also access host containers through the API using [apiclient exec](sources/api/apiclient/README.md#exec-mode).

The server and client are the user-facing components of the API system, but there are a number of other components that work together to make sure your settings are applied, and that they survive upgrades of Bottlerocket.

For more details, see the [API system documentation](sources/api/).

### Default Volumes

Bottlerocket operates with two default storage volumes.
* The root device, `/dev/xvda`, holds the active and passive [partition sets](#updates-1).
  It also contains the bootloader, the dm-verity hash tree for verifying the [immutable root filesystem](SECURITY_FEATURES.md#immutable-rootfs-backed-by-dm-verity), and the data store for the Bottlerocket API.
* The data device, `/dev/xvdb`, is used as persistent storage for container images, container orchestration, [host-containers](#Custom-host-containers), and [bootstrap containers](#Bootstrap-containers-settings).

`BottomDialog` is a bottom dialog layout implemented with `DialogFragment`，And supports pop-up animation, support any layout

## Preview
![BottomDialogShare](/preview/bottom_dialog_share.gif)
![BottomDialogShare](/preview/bottom_dialog_edit.gif)
## Import

Maven

    <dependency>
      <groupId>me.shaohui</groupId>
      <artifactId>bottomdialog</artifactId>
      <version>1.1.9</version>
      <type>pom</type>
    </dependency>
    
or Gradle

	compile 'me.shaohui:bottomdialog:1.1.9'

## Uasge

You can use `BottomDialog` in two different ways ：

### 1.Use directly `BottomDialog`

A simple three lines of code can be done:
    
    BottomDialog.create(getSupportFragmentManager())
                    .setLayoutRes(R.layout.dialog_layout)      // dialog layout
                    .show();
                    
Of course, you can also make simple settings:

    BottomDialog.create(getSupportFragmentManager())
                    .setViewListener(new BottomDialog.ViewListener() {    
                        @Override
                        public void bindView(View v) {
                            // // You can do any of the necessary the operation with the view
                        }
                    })
                    .setLayoutRes(R.layout.dialog_layout)  
                    .setDimAmount(0.1f)            // Dialog window dim amount(can change window background color）, range：0 to 1，default is : 0.2f
                    .setCancelOutside(false)     // click the external area whether is closed, default is : true
                    .setTag(""BottomDialog"")     // setting the DialogFragment tag
                    .show();

So Easy！

### 2.or extends `BaseBottomDialog` to use

First of all, according to your needs to define a class，extends `BaseBottomDialog`，For example below `ShareBottomDialog`
    
    public class ShareBottomDialog extends BaseBottomDialog{
    
        @Override
        public int getLayoutRes() {
            return R.layout.dialog_layout;
        }
    
        @Override
        public void bindView(View v) {
            // do any thing you want
        }
    }

So simple, only two abstract methods needed to achieve, the rest is to add your logic. Of course, you can also rewrite some of the necessary methods to meet your needs, You can manipulate this Dialog as you would a Fragment

    int getHeight()                 // return your bottomDialog height

    float getDimAmount()            // set dialog dim amount（can change window background color）, default is 0.2f

    boolean getCancelOutside()      // click the external area whether is closed, default is : true

    String getFragmentTag()         // set dialogFragment tag

The rest is use it：

        ShareBottomDialog dialog = new ShareBottomDialog();
        dialog.show(getFragmentManager());

That is all！

  * [License](#license)


Installation
=================

In your project's `build.gradle` file add the following line to the `dependencies` group:

	compile 'it.sephiroth.android.library.bottomnavigation:bottom-navigation:3.0.0'


Usage
=================
Usage of the BottomNavigation widget is very easy. Just place it in your layout.xml like this:

```xml
<?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""utf-8""?>
<androidx.coordinatorlayout.widget.CoordinatorLayout android:id=""@+id/CoordinatorLayout01""
	xmlns:android=""http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android""
    xmlns:app=""http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto""
    android:layout_width=""match_parent""
	android:layout_height=""match_parent""
    android:fitsSystemWindows=""true"">

	...your content...

    <it.sephiroth.android.library.bottomnavigation.BottomNavigation
	    android:id=""@+id/BottomNavigation""
        android:layout_width=""match_parent""
	    android:layout_height=""wrap_content""
        android:layout_gravity=""bottom""
	    app:bbn_entries=""@menu/bottombar_menu_4items""
        app:bbn_scrollEnabled=""true""
        app:bbn_badgeProvider=""@string/bbn_badgeProvider""
	    app:layout_behavior=""@string/bbn_phone_view_behavior"" />
</androidx.coordinatorlayout.widget.CoordinatorLayout>
```

All the menu main configurations are defined within the xml menu resource itself. Here's an example of a menu with 4 items:

```xml
<?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""utf-8""?>
<menu xmlns:android=""http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android""
	xmlns:app=""http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto""
    android:background=""@android:color/black""
    app:bbn_badgeColor=""#FFFF0000""
	app:bbn_rippleColor=""#33ffffff"">
    <item
	    android:id=""@+id/bbn_item1""
    	android:color=""@color/colorPrimary""
        android:icon=""@drawable/ic_cloud_off_white_24dp""
	    android:title=""Cloud Sync"" />
    <item
	    android:id=""@+id/bbn_item2""
        android:color=""@android:color/holo_green_dark""
	    android:icon=""@drawable/ic_cast_connected_white_24dp""
        android:title=""Chromecast"" />
	<item
        android:id=""@+id/bbn_item3""
	    android:color=""@android:color/holo_orange_dark""
        android:icon=""@drawable/ic_mail_white_24dp""
	    android:title=""Mail"" />
    <item
	    android:id=""@+id/action4""
    	android:color=""#FF5252""
        android:icon=""@drawable/ic_format_list_numbered_white_24dp""
	    android:title=""List"" />
</menu>
```


Examples
=================

| 4 shifting items menu | 3 fixed items menu |
| :------------: | :-----------: |
|	![Video 1](art/video1.gif)	|	![Video 2](art/video2.gif)	|

| 4 items no background |  Tablet mode |
| :------------: | :-----------: |
| 4 items without changing background. <br />Menu show/hide feature is also disabled | Menu can be easily setup for (left or right) tablet support. |
| ![Video 3](art/video3.gif) | ![Tablet Mode](art/tablet.png) |

Sizing
=================

Dimensions and paddings follow the Google giudelines<br />
![Sizing](art/sizing.png)

# Tablets

The View supports tablet mode too (Left or Right). In order to enable tablet mode this is the configuration that should be used:

```xml
<it.sephiroth.android.library.bottomnavigation.BottomNavigation
    android:id=""@+id/BottomNavigation""
    android:layout_width=""match_parent""
    android:layout_height=""wrap_content""
    android:layout_gravity=""start""
    app:bbn_entries=""@menu/bottombar_menu_3items""
    app:bbn_badgeProvider=""@string/bbn_badgeProvider""
    app:layout_behavior=""@string/bbn_tablet_view_behavior"" />
```



Styling
=================

The xml menu supports the following attributes in the &lt;menu&gt; tag:


```xml
<declare-styleable name=""BottomNavigationMenu"">
    <!-- menu default background color -->
    <attr name=""android:background"" />
    
    <!-- default badge color -->
    <attr name=""bbn_badgeColor"" format=""color"" />

    <!-- animation duration for the menu items -->
    <attr name=""bbn_itemAnimationDuration"" format=""integer"" />

    <!-- ripple selector color -->
    <attr name=""bbn_rippleColor"" format=""color"" />

    <!-- menu item active color -->
    <attr name=""bbn_itemColorActive"" format=""color"" />

    <!-- menu item inactive color -->
    <attr name=""bbn_itemColorInactive"" format=""color"" />

    <!-- menu item disabled color -->
    <attr name=""bbn_itemColorDisabled"" format=""color"" />

    <!-- force fixed behavior and always display item labels -->
    <!-- default implementation is false and the labels are -->
    <!-- shown only if there are less than 4 items in the menu -->
    <attr name=""bbn_alwaysShowLabels"" format=""boolean"" />
</declare-styleable>
```

> **Note:** By default when there are 4 or 5 elements, only the selected item will display the label.
In order to force all the items to always show their label, use `bbn_alwaysShowLabels` in the menu xml.

Badges
=================

![Badges](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sephiroth74/Material-BottomNavigation/master/art/badges1.png)

There's a basic support for badges using the default implementation.
In order to display a badge in the current BottomNavigation view, all you have to do is:

```java
    final BadgeProvider provider = bottomNavigationView.getBadgeProvider();
    provider.show(R.id.bbn_item3);
```
            
This code will show a little circle badge on the menu item with the id ""bbn_item3"". <br />
You can define the default badge color inside the menu xml itself:

```xml
<menu xmlns:android=""http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android""
    xmlns:app=""http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto""
    app:bbn_badgeColor=""#FFFF0000"">
    
    <item
        android:id=""@+id/bbn_item1""
        android:color=""@color/colorPrimary""
        android:icon=""@drawable/ic_cloud_off_white_24dp""
        android:title=""Cloud Sync"" />
        
    ...
</menu>
```

Then you can hide the badge using:

```java
    bottomNavigation.getBadgeProvider().remove(R.id.bbn_item3);
```

Badges Customization
=================

You can use your own [Drawable](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/graphics/drawable/Drawable.html) by extending the `BadgeProvider` class. 
Once you've setup your new class you can tell the BottomNavigation view to use your class by specifying it in the ""bbn_badgeProvider"" attribute of your xml file. <br />
For instance:

```xml
<it.sephiroth.android.library.bottomnavigation.BottomNavigation
    android:id=""@id/BottomNavigation""
    android:layout_width=""match_parent""
    android:layout_height=""match_parent""
    android:layout_gravity=""bottom""
    app:bbn_badgeProvider=""my.custom.BadgeProviderCustom""
    app:bbn_entries=""@menu/bottombar_menu_4items""
    app:layout_behavior=""@string/bbn_phone_view_behavior"" />
```

This will make your `my.custom.BadgeProviderCustom` the default BadgeProvider.

## Supporting The Project

I get paid to write on Medium. Readers following me, applauding and commenting on my articles, all helps with my earnings. I provided this bot to all of you for free and actively developing it. One way you can support my efforts is to follow me on Medium and read my articles. The Medium subscription is $5 a month (roughly £3) so basically nothing in terms of the value you are getting from the bot. Your efforts here would be greatly appreciated!

Follow me on Medium for updates!

    Status: Downloaded newer image for ghcr.io/whittlem/pycryptobot/pycryptobot:latest
    ghcr.io/whittlem/pycryptobot/pycryptobot:latest

Local repo

    % docker build -t pycryptobot .

## Additional Information

The ""requirements.txt"" was created with `python3 -m pip freeze`

## Run it

### Manual

    % python3 pycryptobot.py <arguments>

### Docker (Option 1)

    Example Local Absolute Path: /home/example/config.json
    Example Market: BTC-GBP

    Daemon:
    % docker run --name BTC-GBP -v /home/example/config.json:/app/config.json -d ghcr.io/whittlem/pycryptobot/pycryptobot:latest <arguments>

    Example:
    % docker run --name BTC-GBP -v /Users/whittlem/Documents/Repos/Docker/config.json:/app/config.json -d ghcr.io/whittlem/pycryptobot/pycryptobot:latest --live 0
    e491ae4fdba28aa9e74802895adf5e856006c3c63cf854c657482a6562a1e15

    Interactive:
    % docker run --name BTC-GBP -v /home/example/config.json:/app/config.json -it ghcr.io/whittlem/pycryptobot/pycryptobot:latest <arguments>

    List Processes:
    % docker ps

    Example:
    % docker ps
    CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                                             COMMAND                  CREATED          STATUS          PORTS     NAMES
    e491ae4fdba2   ghcr.io/whittlem/pycryptobot/pycryptobot:latest   ""python3 pycryptobot…""   46 seconds ago   Up 44 seconds             BTC-GBP

    Container Shell:
    % docker exec -it BTC-GBP /bin/bash
    [root@e491ae4fdba2 app]#

    Build your own image (if necessary):
    docker build -t pycryptobot_BTC-GBP .

    Running the docker image:
    docker run -d --rm --name pycryptobot_BTC-GBP_container pycryptobot_BTC-GBP

Typically I would save all my settings in the config.json but running from the command line I would usually run it like this.

    % python3 pycryptobot.py --market BTC-GBP --granularity 3600 --live 1 --verbose 0 --selllowerpcnt -2

### docker-compose (Option 2)

To run using the config.json in template folder,

    % docker-compose up -d

By default, docker-compose will use the config inside `./market/template`. We provide this as a template for any market config.

For each market you want to trade, create a copy of this folder under market.
Also create either a coinbase.key or binance.key file to each folder depending which trading platform is being used.
For example, if you are trading `BTCEUR` and `ETHEUR` your market folder should look like this:

    ├── market
    │ ├── BTCEUR
    │ │ ├── config.json
    │ │ ├── pycryptobot.log
    │ │ └── graphs
    │ └── ETHEUR
    │   ├── config.json
    │   ├── pycryptobot.log
    │   └── graphs

modify docker-compose.yaml

    version: ""3.9""

    services:
      btceur:
        build:
          context: .
        container_name: btceur
        volumes:
          - ./market/BTCEUR/coinbase.key:/app/coinbase.key.json
          - ./market/BTCEUR/config.json:/app/config.json
          - ./market/BTCEUR/pycryptobot.log:/app/pycryptobot.log
          - ./market/BTCEUR/graphs:/app/graphs
          - /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro
        environment:
          - PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1
        deploy:
          restart_policy:
            condition: on-failure

      etheur:
        build:
          context: .
        container_name: etheur
        volumes:
          - ./market/ETHEUR/coinbase.key:/app/coinbase.key.json
          - ./market/ETHEUR/config.json:/app/config.json
          - ./market/ETHEUR/pycryptobot.log:/app/pycryptobot.log
          - ./market/ETHEUR/graphs:/app/graphs
          - /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro
        environment:
          - PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1
        deploy:
          restart_policy:
            condition: on-failure

Run all your bots. Note that each market should have it's own config. Graphs will be saved on each market's folder.

    % docker-compose up -d

### Kubernetes (Helm) (Option 3)

There is a helm chart available in this repo. It will create your config.json as a configmap and the binance/coinbase keys as secrets, and mount them into the Pod.
To run pycryptobot as a Kubernetes deployment, create your helm values as yaml in the following format (do not change the path to the api_key_file):

    config: >
        {
            ""coinbasepro"": {
                ""api_url"": ""https://api.pro.coinbase.com"",
                ""config"": {
                    ""base_currency"": ""ETH"",
                    ""quote_currency"": ""EUR"",
                    ""live"": 1,
                    ""sellatloss"": 0,
                    ""disablelog"": 1,
                    ""autorestart"": 1
                },
                ""api_key_file"": ""/app/keys/coinbasepro.key""
            },
            ""telegram"" : {
                ""token"" : ""<telegram_token>"",
                ""client_id"" : ""<client_id>"",
            }
        }

    coinbasepro_key: |
        XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
        YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
        zzzzzzzzzzzz

Or, for binance:

    config: >
        {
            ""binance"": {
                ""api_url"": ""https://api.binance.com"",
                ""config"": {
                    ""base_currency"": ""ETH"",
                    ""quote_currency"": ""EUR"",
                    ""live"": 1,
                    ""sellatloss"": 0,
                    ""disablelog"": 1,
                    ""autorestart"": 1
                },
                ""api_key_file"": ""/app/keys/binance.key""
            },
            ""telegram"" : {
                ""token"" : ""<telegram_token>"",
                ""client_id"" : ""<client_id>"",
            }
        }

    binance_key: |
        XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
        YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY

Or, for kucoin:

    config: >
        {
            ""kucoin"": {
                ""api_url"": ""https://api.kucoin.com"",
                ""config"": {
                    ""base_currency"": ""ETH"",
                    ""quote_currency"": ""EUR"",
                    ""live"": 1,
                    ""sellatloss"": 0,
                    ""disablelog"": 1,
                    ""autorestart"": 1
                },
                ""api_key_file"": ""/app/keys/coinbasepro.key""
            },
            ""telegram"" : {
                ""token"" : ""<telegram_token>"",
                ""client_id"" : ""<client_id>"",
            }
        }

    kucoin_key: |
        XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
        YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
        zzzzzzzzzzzz

Or both:

    config: >
        {
            ""coinbasepro"": {
                ""api_url"": ""https://api.pro.coinbase.com"",
                ""config"": {
                    ""base_currency"": ""ETH"",
                    ""quote_currency"": ""EUR"",
                    ""live"": 1,
                    ""sellatloss"": 0,
                    ""disablelog"": 1,
                    ""autorestart"": 1
                },
                ""api_key_file"": ""/app/keys/coinbasepro.key""
            },
            ""binance"": {
                ""api_url"": ""https://api.binance.com"",
                ""config"": {
                    ""base_currency"": ""ETH"",
                    ""quote_currency"": ""EUR"",
                    ""live"": 1,
                    ""sellatloss"": 0,
                    ""disablelog"": 1,
                    ""autorestart"": 1
                },
                ""api_key_file"": ""/app/keys/binance.key""
            },
            ""kucoin"": {
                ""api_url"": ""https://api.kucoin.com"",
                ""config"": {
                    ""base_currency"": ""ETH"",
                    ""quote_currency"": ""EUR"",
                    ""live"": 1,
                    ""sellatloss"": 0,
                    ""disablelog"": 1,
                    ""autorestart"": 1
                },
                ""api_key_file"": ""/app/keys/kucoin.key""
            },
            ""telegram"" : {
                ""token"" : ""<telegram_token>"",
                ""client_id"" : ""<client_id>"",
            }
        }

    coinbasepro_key: |
        XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
        YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
        zzzzzzzzzzzz
    binance_key: |
        XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
        YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
    kucoin_key: |
        XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
        YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
        zzzzzzzzzzzz

Then run:

    git clone https://github.com/whittlem/pycryptobot
    cd pycryptobot/chart
    helm upgrade -i pycryptobot-eth-eur -f <path_to_helm_config>

So if you created above helm values file as config-eth-eur.yaml, you would run:

    helm upgrade -i pycryptobot-eth-eur -f config-eth-eur.yaml

## Bot mechanics

Smart switching:

* If the EMA12 is greater than the EMA26 on the 1 hour and 6 hour intervals switch to start trading on the 15 minute intervals
* If the EMA12 is lower than the EMA26 on the 1 hour and 6 hour intervals switch back to trade on the 1 hour intervals
* If a ""granularity"" is specified as an argument or in the config.json then smart switching will be disabled
* Force smart switching between 1 hour and 15 minute intervals with ""smartswitch"" argument or config option (1 or 0)

Buy signal:

* EMA12 is currently crossing above the EMA26 and MACD is above the Signal *OR* MACD is currently crossing above the Signal and EMA12 is above the EMA26
* Golden Cross (SMA50 is above the SMA200) <-- bull market detection
* On-Balance Volume Percent > -5 <-- suitable momentum required
* Elder Ray Buy is True <-- bull market detection

The bot will only trade in a bull market to minimise losses! (you can disable this)

Special buy cases:

* ""nobuynearhighpcnt"" to specify the percentage from high that the bot should not buy if ""disablebuynearhigh"" is not specified.
* ""buymaxsize"" specifies a fixed max amount of the quote currency to buy with.
* ""buylastsellsize"" when enabled, bot will buy the same size as the last sell size for the current market.
* ""trailingbuypcnt"" specifies the percentage for the price to increase before placing buy order after receiving buy signal
* ""trailingimmediatebuy"" will trigger an immediate buy if ""trailingbuypcnt"" is reached.  Use caution, may not advisable on all markets. Default is to wait until candle close to process buy like a standard buy signal.
* ""marketmultibuycheck"" when enabled, bot will perform an additional check on base and quote balance to prevent multiple buys.
        It has been determined that some market pairs have problem API responses which can create a multiple buy issue.
        Please Note:  ""marketmultibuycheck"" will conflict with configurations that use ""sellpercent"".

Sell signal:

* EMA12 is currently crossing below the EMA26
* MACD is below the Signal

Special sell cases:

* ""nosellminpcnt"" specifies the lower margin limit to not sell above
* ""nosellmaxpcnt"" specifies the upper margin limit to not sell below
* If ""sellatloss"" is on, bot will sell if price drops below the lower Fibonacci band
* If ""sellatloss"" is on and ""selllowerpcnt"" is specified the bot will sell at the specified amount E.g. -2 for -2% margin
* If ""sellatloss"" is on and ""trailingstoploss"" is specified the bot will sell at the specified amount below the buy high
* If ""sellupperpcnt"" is specified the bot will sell at the specified amount E.g. 10 for 10% margin (Depending on the conditions I lock in profit at 3%)
* If the margin exceeds 3% and the price reaches a Fibonacci band it will sell to lock in profit
* If the margin exceeds 3% but a strong reversal is detected with negative OBV and MACD < Signal it will sell
* ""sellatloss"" set to 0 prevents selling at a loss
* ""preventloss"" set to 1 to force a sell before margin is negative (losing money on active trade).  Default trigger point is 1%.  If nosellmaxpcnt is set it will be used as the default, unless preventlosstrigger is set to set a custom trigger point.
* ""preventlosstrigger"" is the margin set point that will trigger/allow the preventloss function to start watching the margin and will sell when margin reaches 0.1% or lower unless preventlossmargin is set.
  NOTE: to disable preventlosstrigger and use preventlossmargin only, set the trigger to 0.
* ""preventlossmargin"" is the margin set point that will cause an immediate sell to prevent a loss.  If this is not set, a default of 0.1% will be used.  ""preventlossmargin"" can be used by itself or in conjunction with ""preventlosstrigger"".

## Optional Options

    --stats                             Display order profit and loss (P&L) report

    --sellatresistance                  Sells if the price reaches either resistance or Fibonacci band
    --enabletelegrambotcontrol          Enable bot control via Telegram
    --sellsmartswitch                 Enables smart switching to 5 minute granularity after a buy is placed
    --enableinsufficientfundslogging    Stop insufficient fund errors from stopping the bot, instead log and continue

    --disabletracker                    Disable saving CSV on buy and sell events

## ""Sell At Loss"" explained

The ""sellatloss"" option disabled has it's advantages and disadvantages. It does prevent any losses but also prevents you from exiting a market before a crash or bear market. Sometimes it's better to make an occasional small loss and make it up with several buys than be conservative and potentially lock a trade for weeks if not months. It happened to me while testing this with the last crash (after Elon's tweet!). Three of my bots did not sell while the profit dropped to -10 to -20%. It did bounce back and I made over 3% a trade with any losses but I also lost out of loads of trading opportunities. It's really a matter of preference. Maybe some markets would be more appropriate than others for this.

## ""Prevent Loss"" explained

The ""preventloss"" option and it's corresponding settings add more options to control losses or minimize losses on trades.  ""preventloss"" does not depend on ""sellatloss"" to work.  The idea of Prevent Loss is to allow you to still use all the other sell criteria and the no sell zones as you would like, but still sell prior to the margin dropping below 0%.  Note: there are still transaction fees from the exchange, this has no effect on fees.  You could increase preventlossmargin to account for fees if you would like.
If ""preventloss"" is set to 1 and enabled, it will watch for the ""preventlosstrigger"" margin percentage to be reached. If ""preventloss"" is enabled and ""preventlosstrigger"" is NOT in you configuration the default ""preventlosstrigger"" is 1%.  Once the trigger percentage is reached, preventloss will monitor the margin until it falls to the ""preventlossmargin"" set point.  If ""preventlossmargin"" is not in your configuration, it has a default setting of 0.1% to make the best attempt to trigger a sell before the margin drops below 0%.  On very fast falling prices, the margin could fall below 0% before the transaction is processed by the exchange.  Set at a level that you are comfortable with so the margin falls in the range you would like.

""preventloss"" and ""preventlossmargin"" can be used without ""preventlosstrigger"" if you choose.  Set ""preventlosstrigger"" to 0 in your config to disable it and sell any time the margin drops below the ""preventlosmargin"" set point.  It is assumed that most users won't want this option which is why you have to disable ""preventlosstrigger"" for it to function in this manner.

Prevent Loss is not a required option.  It allows a little more control over your profits and losses.

## Trailing Buy Percent Explained

When the bot issues a standard buy signal via all normal methods, it waits until the next candle close to buy.  Many times after a buy signal is given, the price for the pair in question will still fall.  Trailing buy will, by default,  check to make sure the price is moving in a positive/upward direction before it buys.  If the price goes lower after the buy signal is given, trailing buy will watch the price changes and will prevent a buy if the price is dropping until it starts to increase again.  This will actually make the bot buy at the lowest price monitored after the buy signal was received.  The default is 0% of increase, so it will only prevent buying from the buy signal until next candle close if the price is decreasing.  At close, if the price is still falling, it will delay the buy again until next close.  This essentially takes an extra step to help stop you from possibly losing profit immediately after a buy, especially when using MACD signals only.
""trailingbuypcnt"" can be set at any percentage above 0.  Run some simualutions or use live: 0 to test the results of various percentage set points.  During testing, 1% had pretty good results, but all trade settings will vary based on market and pair being traded.  It is always recommended that you run tests before trading live with real funds.

""trailingimmediatebuy"" is another setting that can be used in conjunction with ""trailingbuypcnt"".  If ""trailingimmediatebuy"" is enabled (set to 1), ""trailingbuypcnt"" will buy immediately upon the set point being reached, instead of waiting until candle close.  Again, run tests to determine the best settings. 

## Live Trading

In order to trade live you need to authenticate with the Coinbase Pro or Binance APIs. This is all documented in my Medium articles. In summary you will need to include a config.json file in your project root which contains your API keys. If the file does not exist it will only work in test/demo mode.

## Trading Simulation

    --sim ['fast, fast-sample, slow-sample']   Sets simulation mode
    --simstartdate                             Start date for sample simulation e.g '2021-01-15'
    --simenddate                               End date for sample simulation or 'now'

`simstartdate` takes priority over `simenddate` if both are given

### Simulation trades.csv

By default, when running a simulation, if there are any orders,  a file called `trades.csv` with all BUYS and SELLS will be created.

With `--tradesfile` you can control the name and where file is stored, eg `--tradesfile BTSUDC-trades.csv`

## API key / secret / password storage

From now on it's recommended NOT to store the credentials in the config file because people share configs and may inadvertently share their API keys within.

Instead, please, create `binance.key` or `coinbase.key` or `kucoin.key` (or use your own names for the files) and refer to these files in the `config.json` file as:

    ""api_key_file"" : ""binance.key""

Once you have done that, ""api_key"" and ""api_secret"" can be safely removed from your config file and you're free to share your configs without worrying of leaked credentials.

You may also specify API key file with a command line argument like:

    --api_key_file binance.key

### binance.key / conbase.key / kucoin.key examples

Actually it's pretty simple, these files are supposed to be a simple text files with the API key on the first line, API secret on the second line and in case of coinbase and kucoin, probably the API password on the third. No comments or anything else is allowed, just the long string of numbers:

    0234238792873423...82736827638472
    68473847745876abscd9872...8237642

(dots are used to indicate places where the strings were shortened)

## config.json examples

Coinbase Pro basic (using smart switching)

    {
        ""api_url"" : ""https://api.pro.coinbase.com"",
        ""api_key_file"" : ""coinbase.key"",
        ""config"" : {
            ""cryptoMarket"" : ""BTC"",
            ""fiatMarket"" : ""GBP"",
            ""live"" : 1,
            ""sellatloss"" : 0
        }
    }

Coinbase Pro basic (specific granularity, no smart switching)

            }
        }
    }

Kucoin (using smart switching)

    {

        }
    }
Coinbase Pro, Binance and Kucoin (new format)

    {
        ""binance"" : {
            ""api_url"" : ""https://api.binance.com"",
            ""api_key_file"" : ""binance.key"",
            ""config"" : {

                ""verbose"" : 0
            }
        },
        ""coinbasepro"" : {
            ""api_url"" : ""https://api.pro.coinbase.com"",
            ""api_key_file"" : ""coinbase.key"",
            ""config"" : {
                ""base_currency"" : ""BTC"",
                ""quote_currency"" : ""GBP"",
                ""granularity"" : ""3600"",
                ""live"" : 0,
                ""verbose"" : 0
            }
        },
        ""kucoin"" : {
            ""api_url"" : ""https://api.kucoin.com"",
            ""api_key_file"" : ""kucoin.key"",
            ""config"" : {
                ""base_currency"" : ""BTC"",
                ""quote_currency"" : ""GBP"",
                ""granularity"" : ""3600"",
                ""live"" : 0,
                ""verbose"" : 0
            }
        }
    }

All the ""config"" options in the config.json can be passed as arguments E.g. --market <market>

Command line arguments override config.json config.

For telegram, add a piece to the config.json as follows:

    ""telegram"" : {
        ""token"" : ""<token>"",
        ""user_Id"" : ""<user id>"" 
        ""client_id"" : ""<client id>""
    }

You can use @botfather and @myidbot in telegram to create a bot with token and get a client id.

For configuring the volume scanner, add a piece to the config.json as follows:

    ""scanner"" : {
		""atr72_pcnt"" : <float> # default 2.0,
		""enableexitaftersell"" : 1, # once a bot has sold it will exit
		""enableleverage"" : 0, # allow leverage markets from the scanner to start
		""maxbotcount"" : <int>, # maximum amount of bots you want running at once
		""autoscandelay"": <hours>, # number of hours you want to wait between scans
	}

For configuring logger, add a piece to the config.json as follows:
*This is also default configuration of the logger, if no config is given and log is not disabled this configuration will apply.*

    ""logger"" : {
        ""filelog"": 1,
        ""logfile"": ""pycryptobot.log"",
        ""fileloglevel"": ""DEBUG"",
        ""consolelog"": 1,
        ""consoleloglevel"": ""INFO""
    }

""filelog"" and ""consolelog"" can only get 1 (enable) or 0 (disable).
""--disablelog"" argument or ""disablelog"" config will disable to writing logfile as backwards compatibility.
If you want to disable logging entirely, you can set ""filelog"" and ""consolelog"" to 0.

""logfile"" is overridden by '--logfile' console argument.
If '--logfile' used when running bot ""logfile"": ""pycryptobot.log"" line in config file will be ignored.

""fileloglevel"" and ""consoleloglevel"" can get one of 'CRITICAL', 'ERROR', 'WARNING', 'INFO', 'DEBUG', 'NOTSET'
For further detail in log levels: <https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html#logging-levels>

## Multi-Market Trading

The bot can trade multiple markets at once. This is also documented in my Medium articles. The bot will execute buys using the full ""quote currency"" balance it has access too and it will sell the full ""base currency"" balance it has access too. In order to ring-fence your non-bot funds you should create another ""Portfolio"" in Coinbase Pro and assign API keys to it. That way you limit exposure. You can so something similar with Binance using sub-accounts but I believe you need to be a certain level to do this.

The way you trade multiple markets at once is create multiple Coinbase Pro portfolios for each each bot instance. You will then clone this project for additional bots with the relevant Portfolio keys (config.json).

I have 5 bots running at once for my Portfolios: ""Bot - BTC-GBP"", ""Bot - BCH-GBP"", ""Bot - ETH-GBP"", ""Bot - LTC-GBP"", and ""Bot - XLM-EUR"".

Assuming each bot has a config.json that looks similar to this (update the ""cryptoMarket"" and ""fiatMarket"" appropriately):

    {
        ""api_url"" : ""https://api.pro.coinbase.com"",
        ""api_key_file"" : ""coinbase.key""
        ""config"" : {
            ""cryptoMarket"" : ""BTC"",
            ""fiatMarket"" : ""GBP"",
            ""live"" : 1
            ""selllowerpcnt"" : -2
        }
    }

The way I run my five bots is as follow:

    BTC-GBP % rm pycryptobot.log; git pull; clear; python3 pycryptobot.py

    BCH-GBP % rm pycryptobot.log; git pull; clear; python3 pycryptobot.py

    ETH-GBP % rm pycryptobot.log; git pull; clear; python3 pycryptobot.py

    LTC-GBP % rm pycryptobot.log; git pull; clear; python3 pycryptobot.py

    XLM-EUR % rm pycryptobot.log; git pull; clear; python3 pycryptobot.py

Notice how I don't pass any arguments. It's all retrieved from the config.json but you can pass the arguments manually as well.

## The merge from ""binance"" branch back into ""main""

Some of you may have been helping test the new code for a few months in the ""binance"" branch. This is now merged back into the ""main"" branch. If you are still using the ""binance"" branch please carry out the following steps (per bot instance).

    git reset --hard
    git checkout main
    git pull
    python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt

Please note you need to be using Python 3.9.x or greater. The previous bot version only required Python 3.x.

## Stats Module

To keep track of the bots performance over time you can run the stats module. e.g.

    python3 pycryptobot.py --stats

This will analyse all the completed buy/sell trade pairs to give stats on todays trades, the trades over the last 7 days, the trades over the last 30 days, and all-time trades.

An optional flag of --statstartdate can be given to ignore all trades that happened before a specified date. The date must be of the format: yyyy-mm-dd. e.g.

    python3 pycryptobot.py --stats --statstartdate 2021-6-01

To get the stats from all your bots, another optional flag of --statgroup can be used. This takes a list of markets and merges the results into one output. e.g.

    python3 pycryptobot.py --stats --statgroup BTCGBP ETHGBP ADAGBP

or via the config.json file e.g.

    ""config"": {
        ....
        ""stats"": 1,
        ""statgroup"": [""BTCGBP"", ""ETHGBP"", ""ADAGBP""],
        ....
    }
Note: --statgroup only accepts a group of markets if the quote currency (in this example GBP) is the same.

If you want more detail than the simple summary, add the optional flag --statdetail. This will print a more detailed list of the transactions.
--statdetail can work in conjunction with --statstartdate and --statgroup.

## Upgrading the bots

I push updates regularly and it's best to always be running the latest code. In each bot directory make sure you run this regularly.

    git pull

I've actually included this in the examples in how to start the bot that will do this for you automatically.

## Fun quick non-live demo

    python3 pycryptobot.py --market BTC-GBP --granularity 3600 --sim fast --verbose 0

If you get stuck with anything email me or raise an issue in the repo and I'll help you sort it out. Raising an issue is probably better as the question and response may help others.

Enjoy and happy trading! :)

74,74,thoughtbot/factory_bot_rails,Gherkin,"# factory_bot_rails [![Build Status][ci-image]][ci] [![Code Climate][grade-image]][grade] [![Gem Version][version-image]][version]

[factory_bot][fb] is a fixtures replacement with a straightforward definition
syntax, support for multiple build strategies (saved instances, unsaved
instances, attribute hashes, and stubbed objects), and support for multiple
factories for the same class (`user`, `admin_user`, and so on), including factory
inheritance.

### Transitioning from factory\_girl\_rails?

Check out the [guide](https://github.com/thoughtbot/factory_bot/blob/4-9-0-stable/UPGRADE_FROM_FACTORY_GIRL.md).

## Rails

factory\_bot\_rails provides Rails integration for [factory_bot][fb].

Supported Rails versions are listed in [`Appraisals`](Appraisals). Supported
Ruby versions are listed in [`.travis.yml`](.travis.yml).

## Download

Github: http://github.com/thoughtbot/factory_bot_rails

Gem:

    $ gem install factory_bot_rails

## Configuration

Add `factory_bot_rails` to your Gemfile in both the test and development groups:

```ruby
group :development, :test do
  gem 'factory_bot_rails'
end
```

You may want to configure your test suite to include factory\_bot methods; see
[configuration](https://github.com/thoughtbot/factory_bot/blob/master/GETTING_STARTED.md#configure-your-test-suite).

### Automatic Factory Definition Loading

By default, factory\_bot\_rails will automatically load factories
defined in the following locations,
relative to the root of the Rails project:

```
factories.rb
test/factories.rb
spec/factories.rb
factories/*.rb
test/factories/*.rb
spec/factories/*.rb
```

You can configure by adding the following to `config/application.rb` or the
appropriate environment configuration in `config/environments`:

```ruby
config.factory_bot.definition_file_paths = [""custom/factories""]
```

This will cause factory\_bot\_rails to automatically load factories in
`custom/factories.rb` and `custom/factories/*.rb`.

It is possible to use this setting to share factories from a gem:

```rb
begin
  require 'factory_bot_rails'
rescue LoadError
end

class MyEngine < ::Rails::Engine
  config.factory_bot.definition_file_paths +=
    [File.expand_path('../factories', __FILE__)] if defined?(FactoryBotRails)
end
```

You can also disable automatic factory definition loading entirely by
using an empty array:

```rb
config.factory_bot.definition_file_paths = []
```

### Generators

Including factory\_bot\_rails in the development group of your Gemfile
will cause Rails to generate factories instead of fixtures.
If you want to disable this feature, you can either move factory\_bot\_rails out
of the development group of your Gemfile, or add the following configuration:

```ruby
config.generators do |g|
  g.factory_bot false
end
```

If fixture replacement is enabled and you already have a `test/factories.rb`
file (or `spec/factories.rb` if using rspec_rails), generated factories will be
inserted at the top of the existing file.
Otherwise, factories will be generated in the
`test/factories` directory (`spec/factories` if using rspec_rails),
in a file matching the name of the table (e.g. `test/factories/users.rb`).

To generate factories in a different directory, you can use the following
configuration:

```ruby
config.generators do |g|
  g.factory_bot dir: 'custom/dir/for/factories'
end
```

Note that factory\_bot\_rails will not automatically load files in custom
locations unless you add them to `config.factory_bot.definition_file_paths` as
well.

The suffix option allows you to customize the name of the generated file with a
suffix:

```ruby
config.generators do |g|
  g.factory_bot suffix: ""factory""
end
```

This will generate `test/factories/users_factory.rb` instead of
`test/factories/users.rb`.

For even more customization, use the `filename_proc` option:

```ruby
config.generators do |g|
  g.factory_bot filename_proc: ->(table_name) { ""prefix_#{table_name}_suffix"" }
end
```

To override the [default factory template][], define your own template in
`lib/templates/factory_bot/model/factories.erb`. This template will have
access to any methods available in `FactoryBot::Generators::ModelGenerator`.
Note that factory\_bot\_rails will only use this custom template if you are
generating each factory in a separate file; it will have no effect if you are
generating all of your factories in `test/factories.rb` or `spec/factories.rb`.

### Support

If you feel that my project is helpful to you, please help me to click on the **star** and let more people see it. Thank you!

### Introduction
&emsp;&emsp;Currently, App on the market almost has a navigation bar at the bottom, so we often need to use this during development. Although there are many tools on the github packaged bottom navigation bar, such as bottombar, alphaIndicator Swipe gradient bottom controls etc., but these controls are not particularly easy to use due to too many functions and no detailed documentation. Sometimes we just want a simple bottom navigation, but we don't want to go One by one in the layout of the LinearLayout or RadioGroup, and then change the tab icon, let ViewPager jump to the corresponding page and a series of tedious operations, this time, you can use BottomBarLayout, simply can achieve the following effect:

            app:itemMarginTop=""-5dp""
            />

      </com.chaychan.library.BottomBarLayout>

	</LinearLayout>


#### Java file settings

Find the corresponding ViewPager and BottomBarLayout, set Adapter for ViewPager, and then set the ViewPager for BottomBarLayout
     
	  mVpContent.setAdapter(new MyAdapter(getSupportFragmentManager()));
      mBottomBarLayout.setViewPager(mVpContent);

This realizes the bottom navigation bar function

#### Add item dynamically

     for (int i = 0; i < mTitleIds.length; i++) {
            //create item
            BottomBarItem item = createBottomBarItem(i);
            mBottomBarLayout.addItem(item); //addItem

            TabFragment homeFragment = createFragment(mTitleIds[i]);
            mFragmentList.add(homeFragment);
    }


	 private BottomBarItem createBottomBarItem(int i) {
        BottomBarItem item = new BottomBarItem.Builder(this)
                .titleTextSize(8)
                .titleNormalColor(R.color.tab_normal_color)
                .titleSelectedColor(R.color.tab_selected_color)
	//          .openTouchBg(false)
	//          .marginTop(5)
	//          .itemPadding(5)
	//          .unreadNumThreshold(99)
	//          .unreadTextColor(R.color.white)

                //There are still many properties, please see the methods in the Builder for details.
                .create(mNormalIconIds[i], mSelectedIconIds[i], getString(mTitleIds[i]));
        return item;
    }

#### Remove item

     mBottomBarLayout.removeItem(0);

#### Turn on the slide effect

Tab switch between the closure of the default sliding effect, if you need to open the setSmoothScroll () method can be called by calling BottomBarLayout:

    mBottomBarLayout.setSmoothScroll(true);

You can also specify BottomBarLayout's smoothScroll property to be true in the layout file.

The effect after opening is as follows:

![](./intro_img/display2.gif)

#### Set the item selected listener

     mBottomBarLayout.setOnItemSelectedListener(new BottomBarLayout.OnItemSelectedListener() {
            @Override
            public void onItemSelected(final BottomBarItem bottomBarItem, int position) {
                   //do something
            }
        });

#### Display unread, show red dot, display message

	mBottomBarLayout.setUnread(0,20);//Set the first tab's unread 20
    mBottomBarLayout.setUnread(1,101);//Set the first tab's unread 101
    mBottomBarLayout.showNotify(2);//The third page shows the tips of the little red dot
    mBottomBarLayout.setMsg(3,""NEW"");//The fourth tab shows the NEW text

When the setting of unread less than or equal to 0, the disappearance of small red dot will disappear;
When the unread count is 1-99, the corresponding number is displayed. 
When unread more than 99, it shows 99+; 

#### Set unaware reading threshold
&emsp;&emsp; The unread threshold may specify the BottomBarItem's unreadThreshold property setting, which defaults to 99. For example, if app:unreadThreshold=""999"" is set, if the reading does not exceed this value, ""999+"" is displayed。

#### Hidden tips red dot, tips message

	mBottomBarLayout.hideNotify(2);//Hide the third page shows the tips of the little red dot
    mBottomBarLayout.hideMsg(3);//Hide the text displayed on the fourth tab

#### Set unread font color
   
    app:unreadTextColor=""@color/unreadTextColor""

#### Set the unread background

    app:unreadTextBg=""@drawable/shape_unread""

Drawable is written as follows:

    <?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""utf-8""?>
	<shape xmlns:android=""http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"">
	    <corners android:radius=""20dp"" />
	    <solid android:color=""@color/red"" />
	    <padding android:left=""4dp"" android:right=""4dp"" android:top=""1dp"" android:bottom=""1dp""/>
	</shape>

#### Set prompt text font color, background

     app:msgTextColor=""@color/msgTextColor""
     app:msgTextBg=""@drawable/shape_msg""

#### Set prompt point background

	 app:notifyPointBg=""@drawable/shape_notify_point""

#### Set the name of lottie file

	app:lottieJson=""home.json""

""home.json"" is stored in the assets directory. To set Lottie's width and height, use the iconWidth and iconHeight attributes


Well, here's the introduction of BottomBarLayout stop here, the reason for the package this control is mainly for the convenience of development, hope to help more people, if you have any ideas or comments may wish to put forward to me, I will continue to improve BottomBarLayout of.


#### Support and encouragement

If you think my project is helpful to you, star! So I will be more motivated to improve this project：

The current iteration of Botania is made possible thanks to the massive help by the part of [williewillus](https://github.com/williewillus), who ported the mod from 1.8 through to the present day, so go buy him a beer or something, I dunno, he's pretty cool.

Botania is licensed under the [Botania License](http://botaniamod.net/license.php)

## Maven info

Maven artifacts are located [here](https://maven.blamejared.com/vazkii/botania/Botania/), each folder representing a version.

Note: As of 1.16, intermediate (non-release) Maven builds are no longer persisted.
That is, you must either depend on a *released* version of Botania, e.g. `1.16.2-407`, or specifically opt in to the bleeding-edge
build of the next version. For example, `1.16.2-408-SNAPSHOT` would be the current bleeding edge version of future version `1.16.2-408`. 

Note that `-SNAPSHOT` versions can be broken from time to time, and you are strongly discouraged from using them unless you are helping dogfood, test, or contribute to Botania. They may also be pruned from time to time to save disk space on the server. Do *not* rely on `-SNAPSHOT` versions for anything important!

In Forge, add the following to your `build.gradle`
```gradle
repositories {
    maven { url 'https://maven.blamejared.com' }
}

dependencies {
    // 1.14+
    compileOnly fg.deobf(""vazkii.botania:Botania:[VERSION]:api"")
    runtimeOnly fg.deobf(""vazkii.botania:Botania:[VERSION]"")
}
```
## Mixin Troubleshooting

Read this if you get crashes when depending on Botania and trying to launch in-dev.
Botania uses Mixins to implement various features.
This may cause issues when depending on Botania in-dev, since ForgeGradle/MixinGradle
do not yet properly support this in-dev like Fabric does.
As a workaround, disable refmaps by defining the `mixin.env.disableRefMap`
JVM argument to `true`.

## 🔨 Getting Started

Please check ➡️ [the Quickstart guide].

## 🚧 Supported Platforms

Project targets **.NET Standard 2.0** and **.NET Core 3.1** at minimum.

## 📦 Extension Packages

This project is referred to as the core package and is always required for developing Telegram bots.
There are extension packages that you can include in your bot projects for additional functionality:

- [Telegram.Bot.Extensions.LoginWidget]
- [Telegram.Bot.Extensions.Passport]

## ✅ Correctness & Testing

This project is fully tested using Unit tests and Systems Integration tests before each release.
In fact, our test cases are self-documenting and serve as examples for Bot API methods.
Once you learn the basics of Telegram chatbots, you will be able to easily understand the code in examples and
use it in your own bot projects.

- `QB_SEED`: If `True` QB torrent will be seeded after and while uploading until reaching specific ratio or time, edit `MaxRatio` or `GlobalMaxSeedingMinutes` or both from qbittorrent.conf (`-1` means no limit, but u can cancel manually by gid). **NOTE**: 1. Don't change `MaxRatioAction`, 2. Only works with `/qbmirror` and `/qbzipmirror`. `Bool`
- `QB_TIMEOUT`: Timeout of dead torrents downloading with qBittorrent in seconds.
- `TG_SPLIT_SIZE`: Size of split in bytes, leave it empty for max size `2GB`.
- `AS_DOCUMENT`: Default Telegram file type upload. Empty or `False` means as media. `Bool`
- `EQUAL_SPLITS`: Split files larger than **TG_SPLIT_SIZE** into equal parts size (Not working with zip cmd). `Bool`
- `CUSTOM_FILENAME`: Add custom word to leeched file name.
- `UPSTREAM_REPO`: Your github repository link, if your repo is private add `https://username:{githubtoken}@github.com/{username}/{reponame}` format. Get token from [Github settings](https://github.com/settings/tokens). So you can update your appllication from filled repository on each restart. **NOTE**: Any change in docker or requirements you need to deploy/build again with updated repo to take effect - DON'T delete .gitignore file.
- `SHORTENER_API`: Fill your Shortener API key.
- `SHORTENER`: Shortener URL.
  - Supported URL Shorteners:
  >exe.io, gplinks.in, shrinkme.io, urlshortx.com, shortzon.com, bit.ly, shorte.st, linkvertise.com , ouo.io

  - Supported Sites:
  >1337x, YTS, Eztv, Torrent Galaxy, Torlock, Piratebay, Nyaasi, Rarbg, Ettv, Zooqle, KickAss, Bitsearch, Glodls, MagnetDL, TorrentProject, TorrentFunk, LimeTorrent
- `CRYPT`: Cookie for gdtot google drive link generator. Follow these [steps](https://github.com/anasty17/mirror-leech-telegram-bot/tree/master#gdtot-cookies).
- `SEARCH_PLUGINS`: List of qBittorrent search plugins (github raw links). I have added some plugins, you can remove/add plugins as you want. Main Source: [qBittorrent Search Plugins (Official/Unofficial)](https://github.com/qbittorrent/search-plugins/wiki/Unofficial-search-plugins).
- `RSS_DELAY`: Time in seconds for rss refresh interval. Recommended `900` seconds at least. Empty means 900 s (default time).
- `RSS_COMMAND`: Choose command for the desired action.
- `RSS_CHAT_ID`: Chat ID where bot will send the rss links.
- `USER_STRING_SESSION`: To send rss links from your telegram account instead of adding bot to channel then adding channel to group to get rss link since bot will not read command from itself or other bot. To generate string session use this command `python3 generate_string_session.py` after mounting repo folder for sure.
  - **RSS NOTE**: `DATABASE_URL` and `RSS_CHAT_ID` is required, otherwise all rss commands will not work.
- Three buttons are already added including Drive Link, Index Link, and View Link, you can add extra buttons, if you don't know what are the below entries, simply leave them empty.

## Deploying on VPS

**IMPORTANT NOTES**:
1. You must set `SERVER_PORT` variable to `80` or any other port you want to use.
2. To clear the container (this will not affect on the image):
```
sudo docker container prune
```
3. To delete the images:
```
sudo docker image prune -a
```
4. Check the number of processing units of your machine with `nproc` cmd and times it by 4, then edit `AsyncIOThreadsCount` in qBittorrent.conf.
5. Use `anasty17/mltb-oracle:latest` for oracle or if u faced problem with arm64 docker run.
   - Tutorial Video for Deploying on Oracle VPS:

## Using Service Accounts for uploading to avoid user rate limit
>For Service Account to work, you must set `USE_SERVICE_ACCOUNTS` = ""True"" in config file or environment variables.
>**NOTE**: Using Service Accounts is only recommended while uploading to a Team Drive.

### 1. Generate Service Accounts. [What is Service Account?](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-accounts)
Let us create only the Service Accounts that we need.

**Warning**: Abuse of this feature is not the aim of this project and we do **NOT** recommend that you make a lot of projects, just one project and 100 SAs allow you plenty of use, its also possible that over abuse might get your projects banned by Google.

>**NOTE**: If you have created SAs in past from this script, you can also just re download the keys by running:
```
python3 gen_sa_accounts.py --download-keys project_id
```
>**NOTE:** 1 Service Account can upload/copy around 750 GB a day, 1 project can make 100 Service Accounts so you can upload 75 TB a day or clone 2 TB from each file creator (uploader email).

#### Two methods to create service accounts
Choose one of these methods

##### 1. Create Service Accounts in existed Project (Recommended Method)
- List your projects ids
```
python3 gen_sa_accounts.py --list-projects
```
- Enable services automatically by this command
```
python3 gen_sa_accounts.py --enable-services $PROJECTID
```
- Create Sevice Accounts to current project
```
python3 gen_sa_accounts.py --create-sas $PROJECTID
```
- Download Sevice Accounts as accounts folder
```
python3 gen_sa_accounts.py --download-keys $PROJECTID
```

##### 2. Create Service Accounts in New Project
```
python3 gen_sa_accounts.py --quick-setup 1 --new-only
```
A folder named accounts will be created which will contain keys for the Service Accounts.

### 2. Add Service Accounts

#### Two methods to add service accounts
Choose one of these methods

##### 1. Add Them To Google Group then to Team Drive (Recommended)
- Mount accounts folder
```
cd accounts
```
- Grab emails form all accounts to emails.txt file that would be created in accounts folder
- `For Windows using PowerShell`
```
$emails = Get-ChildItem .\**.json |Get-Content -Raw |ConvertFrom-Json |Select -ExpandProperty client_email >>emails.txt
```
- `For Linux / MacOs`
```
grep -oPh '""client_email"": ""\K[^""]+' *.json > emails.txt
```
- Unmount acounts folder
```
cd ..
```
Then add emails from emails.txt to Google Group, after that add this Google Group to your Shared Drive and promote it to manager and delete email.txt file from accounts folder

##### 2. Add Them To Team Drive Directly
- Run:
```
python3 add_to_team_drive.py -d SharedTeamDriveSrcID
```
------

### Generate Database

**1. Using Railway**
- Go to [railway](https://railway.app) and create account
- Start new project
- Press on `Provision PostgreSQL`
- After creating database press on `PostgresSQL`
- Go to `Connect` column
- Copy `Postgres Connection URL` and fill `DATABASE_URL` variable with it

**2. Using Heroku PostgreSQL**
<p><a href=""https://dev.to/prisma/how-to-setup-a-free-postgresql-database-on-heroku-1dc1""> <img src=""https://img.shields.io/badge/See%20Dev.to-black?style=for-the-badge&logo=dev.to"" width=""160""""/></a></p>

**3. Using ElephantSQL**
- Go to [elephantsql](https://elephantsql.com) and create account
- Hit `Create New Instance`
- Follow the further instructions in the screen
- Hit `Select Region`
- Hit `Review`
- Hit `Create instance`
- Select your database name
- Copy your database url, and fill `DATABASE_URL` variable with it

------

## Multi Search IDs
To use list from multi TD/folder. Run driveid.py in your terminal and follow it. It will generate **drive_folder** file or u can simply create `drive_folder` file in working directory and fill it, check below format:
```
MyTdName folderID/tdID IndexLink(if available)
MyTdName2 folderID/tdID IndexLink(if available)
```
-----

## Yt-dlp and Aria2c Authentication Using .netrc File
For using your premium accounts in yt-dlp or for protected Index Links, create .netrc file according to following format:

**Note**: Create .netrc and not netrc, this file will be hidden, so view hidden files to edit it after creation.

Format:
```
machine host login username password my_password
```
Example:
```
machine instagram login anas.tayyar password mypassword
```
**Instagram Note**: You must login even if you want to download public posts and after first try you must confirm that this was you logged in from different ip(you can confirm from phone app).

**Youtube Note**: For `youtube` authentication use [cookies.txt](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl#how-do-i-pass-cookies-to-youtube-dl) file.

For Index Link with only password without username, even http auth will not work, so this is the solution.
```
machine example.workers.dev password index_password
```
Where host is the name of extractor (eg. instagram, Twitch). Multiple accounts of different hosts can be added each separated by a new line.

-----

## Gdtot Cookies
To Clone or Leech gdtot link follow these steps:
1. Login/Register to [gdtot](https://new.gdtot.top).
2. Copy this script and paste it in browser address bar.
   - **Note**: After pasting it check at the beginning of the script in broswer address bar if `javascript:` exists or not, if not so write it as shown below.
   ```
   javascript:(function () {
     const input = document.createElement('input');
     input.value = JSON.stringify({url : window.location.href, cookie : document.cookie});
     document.body.appendChild(input);
     input.focus();
     input.select();
     var result = document.execCommand('copy');
     document.body.removeChild(input);
     if(result)
       alert('Cookie copied to clipboard');
     else
       prompt('Failed to copy cookie. Manually copy below cookie\n\n', input.value);
   })();
   ```
   - After pressing enter your browser will prompt a alert.
3. Now you'll get this type of data in your clipboard
   ```
   {""url"":""https://new.gdtot.org/"",""cookie"":""PHPSESSID=k2xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxj63o; crypt=NGxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxWdSVT0%3D""}

   ```
4. From this you have to paste value of crypt in config.env file.

이 프로젝트는 제 코드를 테스트 하기 위한 단순한 테스트 프로젝트 입니다.

**최신 업데이트 정보는 [README.md](https://github.com/chrisleekr/binance-trading-bot#binance-trading-bot)에 서 확인 가능합니다. 이 페이지는 한국어로 프로그램에 대한 설명만 적혀있습니다.**

## 경고

**이 프로그램을 이용하여 돈을 벌 수 있을지 없을지는 절대 보장하지 않습니다.**

**리스크를 감당하실 수 있을 경우에만 사용하세요! 이 코드를 이용하여 직/간접적으로 생긴 손실이나 경제적인 어려움이 생길 경우 절대 책임지지 않습니다.**

**프로그램을 업데이트하기 전에, 구매 가격을 꼭 적어두시기 바랍니다. 환경설정이나 구매 가격 정보가 손실될 수 있습니다.**

## 작동 방법

### 추적 매수 프로그램

이 프로그램은 가격의 하락/상승 추세를 따라가며 추적 매수/추적 매도를 하는 기법을 기반으로 작성되었습니다.

- 이 프로그램은 환경설정에 따라 여러번의 매수/매도가 가능합니다.
- 이 프로그램은 여러개의 코인을 모니터링 가능합니다. 각 코인들은 1초마다 가격 확인 및 매수/매도 처리가 됩니다.
- 이 프로그램은 지속적인 데이터베이스로 MongoDB를 사용합니다. 하지만 라즈베리파이 32bit 지원을 위해 최신 버젼을 사용하지 않습니다. 사용된 MongoDB 버젼은 [apcheamitru](https://hub.docker.com/r/apcheamitru/arm32v7-mongo)에서 제공된 3.2.20입니다
- 이 프로그램은 리눅스와 라즈베리파이 4 32비트에서만 테스트/작동 확인하였습니다. 다른 플랫폼은 테스트하지 않았습니다.

#### 매수 신호

이 프로그램은 그리드 트레이딩 환경설정에 따라 코인을 모니터링합니다.

그리드 트레이딩 #1은 가장 현재 가격이 낮은 가격에 도달했을 경우에, 매수를 위한 STOP-LOSS-LIMIT 주문을 넣습니다. 현재 가격이 계속 떨어질 경우, 이전 주문을 취소하고, 새로운 가격으로 STOP-LOSS-LIMIT 주문을 넣습니다.

그리드 트리이딩 #1 이후로는, 이전 매수 가격에 따라 코인을 모니터링합니다.

- 매도를 위한 코인이 충분할 경우 (보통 $10정도), 그리드 트레이딩 #1의 매수 주문을 넣지않습니다.
- 총 금액이 매수 가격 삭제 가격보다 낮을 경우 매수 가격을 삭제하지 않습니다.

##### 매수 시나리오

예를 들어, 그리드 트레이딩 매수 환경설정이 다음과 같이 되었다고 가정해봅시다:

- 그리드 트레이드 수 (Number of grids): 2
- 그리드 트레이드
  | 번호# | 매수 시작 퍼센트(Trigger Percentage)  | 스탑 가격 퍼센트(Stop Price Percentage) | 리밋 가격 퍼센트(Limit price percentage) | USDT |
  | --- | ------------------- | --------------------- | ---------------------- | ---- |
  | 1   | 1                   | 1.05                  | 1.051                  | 50   |
  | 2   | 0.8                 | 1.03                  | 1.031                  | 100  |

이해를 쉽게 할수 있도록, USDT를 `$`로 표시하도록 하겠습니다. 또한, 쉽게 계산할 수 있도록 커미션은 계산에 넣지 않았습니다. 실제 거래에서는 수량이 다를 수 있습니다.

첫번째 그리드 트레이드의 설정은 다음과 같습니다:

- 그리드 트레이드 번호#: 1
- 매수 시작 퍼센트 (Trigger percentage): 1
- 스탑 가격 퍼센트 (Stop percentage): 1.05 (5.00%)
- 리밋 가격 퍼센트 (Limit percentage): 1.051 (5.10%)
- 최대 매수 금액 (Max purchase amount): $50

현재 가격이 최저 가격($100)까지 떨어지고, 전고점(All-Time High) 제한 가격보다 낮을 경우, 프로그램은 새로운 STOP-LOSS-LIMIT 매수 주문을 넣습니다.

- 스탑 가격 (Stop price): $100 * 1.05 = $105
- 리밋 가격 (Limit price): $100 * 1.051 = $105.1
- 수량 (Quantity): 0.47573

마켓이 다음과 같이 변동되었다고 가정해봅시다:

- 현재 가격 (Current price): $95

그러면 프로그램은 가격 하락을 따라가면서, 새로운 STOP-LOSS-LIMIT 매수 주문을 다음과 같이 넣습니다:

- 스탑 가격 (Stop price): $95 * 1.05 = $99.75
- 리밋 가격 (Limit price): $95 * 1.051 = $99.845
- 수량 (Quantity): 0.5

마켓이 다음과 같이 변동되었다고 가정해봅시다:

- 현재 가격 (Current price): $100

이때, 첫번째 매수가 체결됩니다. 이때, 매수 가격 (Last buy price)를 `$99.845`로 기록합니다. 매수 수량은 `0.5` 입니다.

매수가 체결되면, 프로그램은 매도를 위해 모니터링을 함과 동시에, 다음 매수 그리드 트레이딩를 모니터링합니다.

두번째 그리드 트레이딩의 설정은 다음과 같습니다:

- 그리드 트레이딩 번호#: 2
- 매수 가격 (Current last buy price): $99.845
- 매수 시작 퍼센트 (Trigger percentage): 0.8 (20%)
- 스탑 가격 퍼센트 (Stop percentage): 1.03 (3.00%)
- 리밋 가격 퍼센트 (Limit percentage): 1.031 (3.10%)
- 최대 매수 금액 (Max purchase amount): $100

만약 현재 가격이 20% 낮은 `$79.876`까지 떨어지면, 프로그램은 두번째 그리드 트레이딩을 위한 STOP-LOSS-LIMIT 매수 주문을 넣습니다.

마켓이 다음과 같이 변동되었다고 가정해봅시다:

- 현재 가격 (Current price): $75

이때 프로그램은 가격 하락을 따라가면서, 새로운 STOP-LOSS-LIMIT 매수 주문을 다음과 같이 넣습니다.

- 스탑 가격 (Stop price): $75 * 1.03 = $77.25
- 리밋 가격 (Limit price): $75 * 1.031 = $77.325
- 수량 (Quantity): 1.29

마켓이 다음과 같이 변동되었다고 가정해봅시다:

- 현재 가격 (Current price): $78

이때, 두번째 매수가 체결됩니다. 매수 가격 (Last buy price)는 자동으로 아래와 같이 계산 됩니다:

- 최종 매수 가격: : ($50 + $100)/(0.5 COIN + 1.29 COIN) = $83.80

##### 매수 환경설정

상세한 매수 환경설정에 대한 설명은 아래에서 보실 수 있습니다.

[https://github.com/chrisleekr/binance-trading-bot/wiki/Buy-Scenario](https://github.com/chrisleekr/binance-trading-bot/wiki/Buy-Scenario)

### 매도 신호

만약 매도를 위한 충분한 코인이 있고 매수 가격(Last buy price)가 저장되었을 경우, 프로그램은 첫번째 그리드 트레이딩을 위한 매도 신호를 모니터링하기 시작합니다. 현재 가격이 매도 시작 가격에 도달한다면, 프로그램은 매도 STOP-LOSS-LIMIT 주문을 넣습니다. 만약 현재 가격이 계속 상승한다면, 프로그램은 이전 주문을 취소하고, 새 가격으로 매도 STOP-LOSS-LIMIT 주문을 넣습니다.

- 만약 매수 가격(Last buy price)가 저장되지 않았다면, 코인을 매도하지 않습니다.
- 만약 코인 평가금이 매수 가격 삭제 금액보다 낮다면, 매수 가격 (Last buy price) 기록을 삭제합니다.
- 만약 코인 평가금이 최소 주문 금액보다 낮다면, 코인을 매도하지 않습니다.

#### 매도 시나리오

예를 들어, 그리드 트레이딩 매도 환경설정이 다음과 같이 되었다고 가정해봅시다:

- 그리드 트레이딩 수: 2
- 그리드 트레이딩
  | 번호# | 매도 시작 퍼센트(Trigger Percentage)  | 스탑 가격 퍼센트(Stop Price Percentage) | 리밋 가격 퍼센트(Limit price percentage) | 매도 수량 퍼센트(Sell Quantity Percentage) |
  | --- | ------------------- | --------------------- | ---------------------- |------------------------- |
  | 1st | 1.05                | 0.97                  | 0.969                  | 0.5                      |
  | 2nd | 1.08                | 0.95                  | 0.949                  | 1                        |

매수와 다르게, 매도는 수량 퍼센트를 설정합니다. 만약 보유한 모든 수량을 매도할려면, 간단하게 `1` (100%)로 설정하시면 됩니다.

위에서 매수한 코인은 다음과 같습니다:

- 현재 수량 (Current quantity): 1.79
- 현재 매수 가격 (Current last buy price): $83.80

첫번째 그리드 트레이드의 설정은 다음과 같습니다:

- 그리드 트레이딩 번호# 1
- 매도 시작 퍼센트 (Trigger percentage): 1.05
- 스탑 가격 퍼센트 (Stop price percentage): 0.97
- 리밋 가격 퍼센트 (Limit price percentage): 0.969
- 매도 수량 퍼센트 (Sell amount percentage): 0.5

마켓이 다음과 같이 변동되었다고 가정해봅시다:

- 현재 가격 (Current price): $88

현재 가격이 매도 시작 가격 ($87.99) 보다 높기 때문에, 새로운 STOP-LOSS-LIMIT 매도 주문을 다음과 같이 넣습니다:

- 스탑 가격 (Stop price): $88 * 0.97 = $85.36
- 리밋 가격 (Limit price): $88 * 0.969 = $85.272
- 수량 (Quantity): 0.895

마켓이 다음과 같이 변동되었다고 가정해봅시다:

- 현재 가격 (Current price): $90

그러면 프로그램은 가격 상승을 따라가면서, 새로운 STOP-LOSS-LIMIT 주문을 다음과 같이 넣습니다:

- 스탑 가격 (Stop price): $90 * 0.97 = $87.30
- 리밋 가격 (Limit price): $90 * 0.969 = $87.21
- 수량 (Quantity): 0.895

마켓이 다음과 같이 변동되었다고 가정해봅시다:

- 현재 가격 (Current price): $87

이때, 첫번째 매도 주문이 체결됩니다. 그러면 프로그램은 두번째 그리드 트레이딩 매도 시작 가격($83.80 * 1.08 = $90.504)을 기다립니다.

- 현재 수량 (Current quantity): 0.895
- 현재 매수 가격 (Current last buy price): $83.80

마켓이 다음과 같이 변동되었다고 가정해봅시다:

- 현재 가격 (Current price): $91

현재 가격 ($91)은 두번째 매도 시작 가격 ($90.504)보다 높기 때문에, 프로그램은 새로운 STOP-LOSS-LIMIT 주문을 다음과 같이 넣습니다:

- 스탑 가격 (Stop price): $91 * 0.95 = $86.45
- 리밋 가격 (Limit price): $91 * 0.949 = $86.359
- 수량 (Quantity): 0.895

마켓이 다음과 같이 변동되었다고 가정해봅시다:

- 현재 가격 (Current price): $100

그러면 프로그램은 가격 상승을 따라가면서, 새로운 STOP-LOSS-LIMIT 주문을 다음과 같이 넣습니다:

- 스탑 가격 (Stop price): $100 * 0.95 = $95
- 리밋 가격 (Limit price): $100 * 0.949 = $94.9
- 수량 (Quantity): 0.895

마켓이 다음과 같이 변동되었다고 가정해봅시다:

- 현재 가격 (Current price): $94

이때 두번째 매도 주문이 체결됩니다.

최종 수익은 다음과 같습니다.

- 첫번째 매도: $94.9 * 0.895 = $84.9355
- 두번째 매도: $87.21 * 0.895 = $78.05295
- 최종 수익: $162 (8% 수익)

"
85,85,esthercrawford/EstherBot,JavaScript,"# EstherBot built using the Smooch Bot example
If you want a slightly more sophisticated setup and are comfortable using the console then go see the original here: https://github.com/smooch/smooch-bot-example 

Or if you want to test out EstherBot live go say hi on your platform of choice:
http://estherbot.com

# Build Your Bot

Creating this version will give you a web based chat app. With a few integrations inside of Smooch (like Twilio) you can have your bot talking on other platforms too including SMS, Facebook, and Telegram.  

![heroku](/img/heroku.gif)

## Get Started:

1. First, sign up for a free account at [smooch.io](https://app.smooch.io/signup)

1. With a new Smooch app created, go to the settings tab and take note of your App Token. Also, generate a new Secret Key, and take note of the key ID and secret.

    ![settings](/img/settings.png)

1. Deploy your app to Heroku using the button below. It's a service for hosting apps so go sign up if you don't already have an account – it's free. You'll need to specify your app token, key ID, and secret in the app's `SMOOCH_APP_TOKEN`, `SMOOCH_KEY_ID`, and `SMOOCH_SECRET` config settings.

    [![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/esthercrawford/estherbot)

1. Your app should now be running on Heroku but you're not quite done yet. Take note of the URL where your heroku app is running, for example `https://foo-bar-4242.herokuapp.com`. You'll need to specify this in your heroku app `SERVICE_URL` config variable. You can do this in the Heroku control panel under *Settings* > *Config Variables*. Make sure to go under Deploy and connect to your GitHub repo. Then, enable Automatic Deploys from the master branch (this means anytime you make an edit to your bot's script, it'll automatically update and talk as intended in seconds.) 

1. You should be all set. Open your Heroku app and start chatting with your new bot!

##Teach Your Bot To Talk
Now that you have a bot you need to decide what it'll say. That's where the file script.json comes in. It's the document you need to edit to make your bot talk.

By clicking on the pencil icon you can edit the document. The keywords are on the left, and the bot's response is on the right. For example, if a user types ""hello"" then the bot will say ""Sweet, let's do this...""

Keywords are not case sensitive for users.

The only two keywords you don't want to change are CONNECT ME and DISCONNECT. CONNECT ME turns the automated chat off, so the bot will stop responding to keywords. DISCONNECT will turn the bot back on. 

Also, the initial script starts with ""So you want to learn about Esther? ..."" but of course you'll want to change it. You can edit it in the script.js file.

##Add line breaks to your messages
If you want your bot's responses to be broken into different bubbles you'll need to add \n.
Here's an example: Hi there!\nI’m the personal bot of Esther, a Product Marketer from San Francisco.

Now that message will be broken into two bubbles. First, it'll say ""Hi there!"" then it'll say ""I'm the personal bot of Esther, a Product Marketer from San Francisco.""

##Add images to your messages
Adding pictures is super easy. Make sure you upload the files to your img folder. Then click on the image and select Raw to get the link for your image.

Here's an example of the syntax for adding an image: 

    Hi there!\nI'm the personal bot of Esther, a Product Marketer from San Francisco.\n![esther](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/esthercrawford/EstherBot/master/img/esther.jpg)

##Add buttons to your messages
On Facebook Messenger these buttons are called ""structured messages"". It makes it easier for your user to follow the script. They don't even have to type the keywords - they just have to select a button. That means fewer user errors and less frustration.

In the script.json file you'll notice this: 

    %[Tweet Esther](http://bit.ly/estherbot-tweet)

This is a smiple link button. When the user taps it, they will open the link in a new browser window.

If you want to have a button trigger your bot to do something, you can use a postback buttons that looks like this:

    %[Tell her](postback:twitter)

The syntax is similar to a link button, but note the `postback:` prefix. The ""Tell her"" piece is what the button says, and the ""twitter"" part after the `postback:` prefix is an extra note you can include in the notificaiton your bot receieves when the user taps the button.

⚠️ **Note:** Postback buttons work using Smooch webhooks. This means that your bot needs to be deployed to heroku before the buttons will do anything. If you want to test your bot on your local machine you'll have to use a tunnel service such as [ngrok.io](https://ngrok.io) to make your internet visible, and set your local `SERVICE_URL` environment variable appropraitely. For more information bout postbacks, you can check out the Smooch docs here:

- Postbacks: http://docs.smooch.io/#postbacks
- Webhooks: http://docs.smooch.io/rest/#webhooks

The good news is Estherbot is clever, and simplifies much of this! Estherbot [will automatically](https://github.com/esthercrawford/EstherBot/blob/master/heroku/index.js#L113) accept postback events and treat them as if they were a keyword sent by the user. For example, when a user taps a postback button such as `%[Tell her](postback:twitter)` Estherbot will react as if they had typed out the message `Tell her`.

##Bring it altogether
Read the JSON below and you'll see there are line breaks, an image, and 3 buttons in this bot's response.   

    {
        ""BOT"": ""Hi there!\nI’m the personal bot of Esther, a Product Marketer from San Francisco.\n![esther](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/esthercrawford/smooch-bot-example/master/img/esther.jpg)\nWant to know more about bots or learn about Esther? %[I'm here for the bot](postback:here_for_the_bot) %[Learn about Esther](postback:learn_about_esther) %[One random fact!](postback:random_fact)""
    }

⚠️ **Note:** If you're not familiar with the JSON syntax you can always paste your script into http://jsonlint.com/ to make sure your syntax in order.

##Bonus
Open the Smooch [control panel](https://app.smooch.io) and add more integrations. You can add new user channels like Twilio SMS, or you can add Slack or HipChat which will let you join in on the conversation along side your bot. Pretty neat!

# Troubleshooting your bot

Is your bot misbehaving? Not working? Here are some steps you can follow to figure out what's going wrong.

**Warning:** command line instructions incoming. You may not be accustomed to using the command line but don't worry, it's much easier than you think.


## Check your bot's logs on heroku

If there's a bug in your code, checking the heroku logs is the best way to figure out what's going wrong. Here's how:

1. Install the heroku toolbelt: https://toolbelt.heroku.com/ These are power tools that let you do a lot more than what Heroku dashboard alone allows.

2. Next, open your preferred terminal app. On OSX the default Terminal app will work fine here.

3. Log in to the heroku toolbelt with the following command:

        heroku login

    If the command heroku isn't found, try restarting your terminal app. Once logged in you should be able to list all of your heroku apps like so:

        heroku apps

    which should give you something like this:

        $ heroku apps
        === My Apps
        your-app

4. Now you can check the logs of your heroku app like so:

        heroku logs -a your-app

    This will give you a dump of your most recent app logs. They will look something like the following. Can you spot the error below?

    Did you notice the `SyntaxError` part? It looks like there's a problem in my script.json. If I inspect that file in github I'll see that indeed, I have a stray comma at the end if the second to last line.

    ![image](/img/script-error.png)

    After I remove that comma and redeploy, everything will return to normal.

## How do I deploy my fixes to Heroku?

Great question! Now that you've found your bug and fixed it, you want to redeploy your app. With Heroku you can trigger a deployment using git. Without going into detail, git is a code versioning system it's where github gets its name. Git is the software, github.com is a separate company that hosts git code repositories. If you're using a Mac you should already have git installed. Although git is a very complex tool, it's worth [learning if you're eager](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/what-is-git), but for this guide's purposes we'll be using only the most basic concepts of git, `pull`ing changes from a remote github repository, `commit`ing changes, and then `push`ing those changes out to a remote repository.

1. To deploy using git you first have to download a copy of your heroku app's code, like so:

        git clone https://github.com/your-github-username/your-app

    Note that git will prompt you to enter your github credentials.

2. This will create a new git copy of your code in a new folder. You can go into that folder like so:

        cd your-app

3. Now you can use the heroku toolbelt to link this git copy up to your heroku app with the following command:

        heroku git:remote -a your-app

4. Once that's done, you can now deploy to heroku directly from this directory. If you've made any fixes on github directly, be sure to sync them here like so:

        git pull origin master
        git push heroku master

5. You can also make changes to your local copy of the code. To do this, edit whatever file you wish in your preferred text editor, and then commit and push them up to github. You'll add a commit message, which is a short sentence decribing what you changed.

        git commit -a -m 'Your commit message'
        git push origin master

    Then, you can deploy those changes to heroku in the same way:

        git push heroku master

BoTorch is a library for Bayesian Optimization built on PyTorch.

*BoTorch is currently in beta and under active development!*


#### Why BoTorch ?
BoTorch
* Provides a modular and easily extensible interface for composing Bayesian
  optimization primitives, including probabilistic models, acquisition functions,
  and optimizers.
* Harnesses the power of PyTorch, including auto-differentiation, native support
  for highly parallelized modern hardware (e.g. GPUs) using device-agnostic code,
  and a dynamic computation graph.
* Supports Monte Carlo-based acquisition functions via the
  [reparameterization trick](https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6114), which makes it
  straightforward to implement new ideas without having to impose restrictive
  assumptions about the underlying model.
* Enables seamless integration with deep and/or convolutional architectures in PyTorch.
* Has first-class support for state-of-the art probabilistic models in
  [GPyTorch](http://www.gpytorch.ai/), including support for multi-task Gaussian
  Processes (GPs) deep kernel learning, deep GPs, and approximate inference.


#### Target Audience

The primary audience for hands-on use of BoTorch are researchers and
sophisticated practitioners in Bayesian Optimization and AI.
We recommend using BoTorch as a low-level API for implementing new algorithms
for [Ax](https://ax.dev). Ax has been designed to be an easy-to-use platform
for end-users, which at the same time is flexible enough for Bayesian
Optimization researchers to plug into for handling of feature transformations,
(meta-)data management, storage, etc.
We recommend that end-users who are not actively doing research on Bayesian
Optimization simply use Ax.


## Installation

**Installation Requirements**
- Python >= 3.7
- PyTorch >= 1.9
- gpytorch >= 1.6
- scipy


##### Installing the latest release

The latest release of BoTorch is easily installed either via
[Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section) (recommended):
```bash
conda install botorch -c pytorch -c gpytorch
```
or via `pip`:
```bash
pip install botorch
```

You can customize your PyTorch installation (i.e. CUDA version, CPU only option)
by following the [PyTorch installation instructions](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).

***Important note for MacOS users:***
* Make sure your PyTorch build is linked against MKL (the non-optimized version
  of BoTorch can be up to an order of magnitude slower in some settings).
  Setting this up manually on MacOS can be tricky - to ensure this works properly,
  please follow the [PyTorch installation instructions](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).
* If you need CUDA on MacOS, you will need to build PyTorch from source. Please
  consult the PyTorch installation instructions above.


##### Installing from latest main branch

If you would like to try our bleeding edge features (and don't mind potentially
running into the occasional bug here or there), you can install the latest
development version directly from GitHub (this will also require installing
the current GPyTorch development version):
```bash
pip install --upgrade git+https://github.com/cornellius-gp/gpytorch.git
pip install --upgrade git+https://github.com/pytorch/botorch.git
```

**Manual / Dev install**

Alternatively, you can do a manual install. For a basic install, run:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/pytorch/botorch.git
cd botorch
pip install -e .
```

To customize the installation, you can also run the following variants of the
above:
* `pip install -e .[dev]`: Also installs all tools necessary for development
  (testing, linting, docs building; see [Contributing](#contributing) below).
* `pip install -e .[tutorials]`: Also installs all packages necessary for running the tutorial notebooks.


## Getting Started

Here's a quick run down of the main components of a Bayesian optimization loop.
For more details see our [Documentation](https://botorch.org/docs/introduction) and the
[Tutorials](https://botorch.org/tutorials).

1. Fit a Gaussian Process model to data
  ```python
  import torch
  from botorch.models import SingleTaskGP
  from botorch.fit import fit_gpytorch_model
  from gpytorch.mlls import ExactMarginalLogLikelihood

  train_X = torch.rand(10, 2)
  Y = 1 - (train_X - 0.5).norm(dim=-1, keepdim=True)  # explicit output dimension
  Y += 0.1 * torch.rand_like(Y)
  train_Y = (Y - Y.mean()) / Y.std()

  gp = SingleTaskGP(train_X, train_Y)
  mll = ExactMarginalLogLikelihood(gp.likelihood, gp)
  fit_gpytorch_model(mll)
  ```

2. Construct an acquisition function
  ```python
  from botorch.acquisition import UpperConfidenceBound

  UCB = UpperConfidenceBound(gp, beta=0.1)
  ```

3. Optimize the acquisition function
  ```python
  from botorch.optim import optimize_acqf

  bounds = torch.stack([torch.zeros(2), torch.ones(2)])
  candidate, acq_value = optimize_acqf(
      UCB, bounds=bounds, q=1, num_restarts=5, raw_samples=20,
  )
  ```

## Description
This Binance trading bot analyses the changes in price across all coins on Binance and place trades on the most volatile ones. 
In addition to that, this Binance trading algorithm will also keep track of all the coins bought and sell them according to your specified Stop Loss and Take Profit.



The bot will listen to changes in price accross all coins on Binance. By default, we're only picking USDT pairs. We're excluding Margin (like BTCDOWNUSDT) and Fiat pairs

> Information below is an example and is all configurable

- The bot checks if the any coin has gone up by more than 3% in the last 5 minutes
- The bot will buy 100 USDT of the most volatile coins on Binance
- The bot will sell at 6% profit or 3% stop loss


You can follow the [Binance volatility bot guide](https://www.cryptomaton.org/2021/05/08/how-to-code-a-binance-trading-bot-that-detects-the-most-volatile-coins-on-binance/) for a step-by-step walkthrough of the bot development.

## READ BEFORE USE
1. If you use the `TEST_MODE: False` in your config, you will be using REAL money.
2. To ensure you do not do this, ALWAYS check the `TEST_MODE` configuration item in the config.yml file..
3. This is a framework for users to modify and adapt to their overall strategy and needs, and in no way a turn-key solution.
4. Depending on the current market, the default config might not do much, so you will have to adapt it to your own strategy.

## Introduction

Bots are special [Telegram](https://telegram.org) accounts designed to handle messages automatically. 
Users can interact with bots by sending them command messages in private or group chats. 
These accounts serve as an interface for code running somewhere on your server.

Telegraf is a library that makes it simple for you to develop your own Telegram bots using JavaScript or [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

### Features

- Full [Telegram Bot API 5.5](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api) support
- [Excellent TypeScript typings](https://github.com/telegraf/telegraf/releases/tag/v4.0.0)
- [Lightweight](https://packagephobia.com/result?p=telegraf,node-telegram-bot-api)
- [AWS **λ**](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/nodejs-prog-model-handler.html)
  / [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/products/functions/)
  / [Glitch](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/dashing-light)
  / [Heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs#introduction)
  / Whatever ready
- `http/https/fastify/Connect.js/express.js` compatible webhooks
- Extensible

### Example
  
```js
const { Telegraf } = require('telegraf')

const bot = new Telegraf(process.env.BOT_TOKEN)
bot.start((ctx) => ctx.reply('Welcome'))
bot.help((ctx) => ctx.reply('Send me a sticker'))
bot.on('sticker', (ctx) => ctx.reply('👍'))
bot.hears('hi', (ctx) => ctx.reply('Hey there'))
bot.launch()

// Enable graceful stop
process.once('SIGINT', () => bot.stop('SIGINT'))
process.once('SIGTERM', () => bot.stop('SIGTERM'))
```

```js
const { Telegraf } = require('telegraf')

const bot = new Telegraf(process.env.BOT_TOKEN)
bot.command('oldschool', (ctx) => ctx.reply('Hello'))
bot.command('hipster', Telegraf.reply('λ'))
bot.launch()

// Enable graceful stop
process.once('SIGINT', () => bot.stop('SIGINT'))
process.once('SIGTERM', () => bot.stop('SIGTERM'))
```

## Getting started

### Telegram token

To use the [Telegram Bot API](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api), 
you first have to [get a bot account](https://core.telegram.org/bots) 
by [chatting with BotFather](https://core.telegram.org/bots#6-botfather).

BotFather will give you a *token*, something like `123456789:AbCdfGhIJKlmNoQQRsTUVwxyZ`.

### Installation

```shellscript
$ npm install telegraf
```
or
```shellscript
$ yarn add telegraf
```
or
```shellscript
$ pnpm add telegraf
```

### `Telegraf` class

[`Telegraf`] instance represents your bot. It's responsible for obtaining updates and passing them to your handlers.

Start by [listening to commands](https://telegraf.js.org/classes/telegraf.html#command) and [launching](https://telegraf.js.org/classes/telegraf.html#launch) your bot.

### `Context` class

`ctx` you can see in every example is a [`Context`] instance.
[`Telegraf`] creates one for each incoming update and passes it to your middleware.
It contains the `update`, `botInfo`, and `telegram` for making arbitrary Bot API requests,
as well as shorthand methods and getters.

This is probably the class you'll be using the most.

-->

#### Shorthand methods

```js
import { Telegraf } from 'telegraf'

const bot = new Telegraf(process.env.BOT_TOKEN)

bot.command('quit', (ctx) => {
  // Explicit usage
  ctx.telegram.leaveChat(ctx.message.chat.id)

  // Using context shortcut
  ctx.leaveChat()
})

bot.on('text', (ctx) => {
  // Explicit usage
  ctx.telegram.sendMessage(ctx.message.chat.id, `Hello ${ctx.state.role}`)

  // Using context shortcut
  ctx.reply(`Hello ${ctx.state.role}`)
})

bot.on('callback_query', (ctx) => {
  // Explicit usage
  ctx.telegram.answerCbQuery(ctx.callbackQuery.id)

  // Using context shortcut
  ctx.answerCbQuery()
})

bot.on('inline_query', (ctx) => {
  const result = []
  // Explicit usage
  ctx.telegram.answerInlineQuery(ctx.inlineQuery.id, result)

  // Using context shortcut
  ctx.answerInlineQuery(result)
})

bot.launch()

// Enable graceful stop
process.once('SIGINT', () => bot.stop('SIGINT'))
process.once('SIGTERM', () => bot.stop('SIGTERM'))
```

## Production

### Webhooks

```js
const { Telegraf } = require('telegraf')
const fs = require('fs')
require('dotenv')

const bot = new Telegraf(process.env.BOT_TOKEN)

// TLS options
const tlsOptions = {
  key: fs.readFileSync('server-key.pem'),
  cert: fs.readFileSync('server-cert.pem'),
  ca: [
    // This is necessary only if the client uses a self-signed certificate.
    fs.readFileSync('client-cert.pem')
  ]
}

// Set telegram webhook
// The second argument is necessary only if the client uses a self-signed
// certificate. Including it for a verified certificate may cause things to break.
bot.telegram.setWebhook('https://server.tld:8443/secret-path', {
  source: 'server-cert.pem'
})

// Start https webhook
bot.startWebhook('/secret-path', tlsOptions, 8443)

// Http webhook, for nginx/heroku users.
bot.startWebhook('/secret-path', null, 5000)
```

Use `webhookCallback()` if you want to attach Telegraf to an existing http server.

<!-- global bot, tlsOptions -->

```js
require('http')
  .createServer(bot.webhookCallback('/secret-path'))
  .listen(3000)

require('https')
  .createServer(tlsOptions, bot.webhookCallback('/secret-path'))
  .listen(8443)
```

### Error handling

If middleware throws an error or times out, Telegraf calls `bot.handleError`. If it rethrows, update source closes, and then the error is printed to console and process [hopefully](https://nodejs.org/api/cli.html#cli_unhandled_rejections_mode) terminates. If it does not rethrow, the error is swallowed.

Default `bot.handleError` always rethrows. You can overwrite it using `bot.catch` if you need to.

⚠️ Always rethrow `TimeoutError`!

⚠️ Swallowing unknown errors might leave the process in invalid state!

ℹ️ In production, `systemd` or [`pm2`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pm2) can restart your bot if it exits for any reason.

## Advanced topics

### Working with files

Supported file sources:

- `Existing file_id`
- `File path`
- `Url`
- `Buffer`
- `ReadStream`

Also, you can provide an optional name of a file as `filename` when you send the file.

<!-- global bot, fs -->

```js
bot.on('message', (ctx) => {
  // resend existing file by file_id
  ctx.replyWithSticker('123123jkbhj6b')

  // send file
  ctx.replyWithVideo({ source: '/path/to/video.mp4' })

  // send stream
  ctx.replyWithVideo({
    source: fs.createReadStream('/path/to/video.mp4')
  })

  // send buffer
  ctx.replyWithVoice({
    source: Buffer.alloc()
  })

  // send url via Telegram server
  ctx.replyWithPhoto('https://picsum.photos/200/300/')

  // pipe url content
  ctx.replyWithPhoto({
    url: 'https://picsum.photos/200/300/?random',
    filename: 'kitten.jpg'
  })
})
```

### Middleware

In addition to `ctx: Context`, each middleware receives `next: () => Promise<void>`.

As in Koa and some other middleware-based libraries,
`await next()` will call next middleware and wait for it to finish:

```js
import { Telegraf } from 'telegraf'

const bot = new Telegraf(process.env.BOT_TOKEN)

bot.use(async (ctx, next) => {
  console.time(`Processing update ${ctx.update.update_id}`)
  await next() // runs next middleware
  // runs after next middleware finishes
  console.timeEnd(`Processing update ${ctx.update.update_id}`)
})

bot.on('text', (ctx) => ctx.reply('Hello World'))
bot.launch()

// Enable graceful stop
process.once('SIGINT', () => bot.stop('SIGINT'))
process.once('SIGTERM', () => bot.stop('SIGTERM'))
```

With this simple ability, you can:
- extract information from updates and then `await next()` to avoid disrupting other middleware,
- like [`Composer`] and [`Router`], `await next()` for updates you don't wish to handle,
- like [`session`] and [`Scenes`], [extend the context](#extending-context) by mutating `ctx` before `await next()`,
- [intercept API calls](https://github.com/telegraf/telegraf/discussions/1267#discussioncomment-254525),
- reuse [other people's code](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=telegraf-),
- do whatever **you** come up with!

[`Composer`]: https://telegraf.js.org/classes/composer.html
[`Context`]: https://telegraf.js.org/classes/context.html
[`Router`]: https://telegraf.js.org/classes/router.html
[`session`]: https://telegraf.js.org/modules.html#session
[`Scenes`]: https://telegraf.js.org/modules/scenes.html
[`Telegraf`]: https://telegraf.js.org/classes/telegraf.html

### Usage with TypeScript

Telegraf is written in TypeScript and therefore ships with declaration files for the entire library.
Moreover, it includes types for the complete Telegram API via the [`typegram`](https://github.com/KnorpelSenf/typegram) package.
While most types of Telegraf's API surface are self-explanatory, there's some notable things to keep in mind.

#### Extending `Context`

The exact shape of `ctx` can vary based on the installed middleware.
Some custom middleware might register properties on the context object that Telegraf is not aware of.
Consequently, you can change the type of `ctx` to fit your needs in order for you to have proper TypeScript types for your data.
This is done through Generics:

```ts
import { Context, Telegraf } from 'telegraf'

// Define your own context type
interface MyContext extends Context {
  myProp?: string
  myOtherProp?: number
}

// Create your bot and tell it about your context type
const bot = new Telegraf<MyContext>('SECRET TOKEN')

// Register middleware and launch your bot as usual
bot.use((ctx, next) => {
  // Yay, `myProp` is now available here as `string | undefined`!
  ctx.myProp = ctx.chat?.first_name?.toUpperCase()
  return next()
})
// ...
```

### Docker Installation

See [etc/Dockerfile](https://github.com/ctubio/Krypto-trading-bot/tree/master/etc#dockerfile) file.

### Windows Installation

Before starting with a manual installation, ensure your target machine has Windows 7 or greater and [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/) installed.

Use MSYS2 Terminal to install `make` (with command `pacman -S make`), and then proceed as usual with the installation.

### Manual GIT Installation

0. Ensure you agree to install collaborative non-free software (see [Unlock](#unlock) section).

1. Ensure your target machine has `git` and `make` installed.

2. Download it wherever you want (feel free to customize the suggested folder name K) and execute the installer:
```
 $ git clone ssh://git@github.com/ctubio/Krypto-trading-bot K
 $ cd K
 $ make install
```

3. Open and edit the config file `K.sh` in your favorite text editor:
```
 $ vim K.sh
```

To upgrade anytime see [Upgrade to the latest commit](#upgrade-to-the-latest-commit) section.

### Manual ZIP Installation

0. Ensure you agree to install collaborative non-free software (see [Unlock](#unlock) section).

1. Ensure your target machine has `curl` and `make` installed.

2. Download it wherever you want (feel free to customize the suggested folder name K) and execute the installer:
```
 $ mkdir K
 $ cd K
 $ curl -O krypto.ninja/Makefile
 $ make install
```

3. Open and edit the config file `K.sh` in your favorite text editor:
```
 $ vim K.sh
```

To upgrade anytime to the latest release just run `make reinstall`.

### Configuration After Manual Installation

See [etc/K.sh.dist](https://github.com/ctubio/Krypto-trading-bot/blob/master/etc/K.sh.dist) file or better your own copy of `K.sh` file located in the top level path.

It just contains a few variables with examples. The very end of the file contains the code that starts the bot.

Once your config file is ready, you can execute it to start the bot:
```
 $ ./K.sh
```

Alternatively use `make start` to run `K.sh` in the background using [screen](https://kb.iu.edu/d/acuy) (to see the output, attach the screen with `make screen` [or run all at once with `make start screen`]).

Feel free to run `make stop` or `make restart` anytime, and don't forget to [read the fucking manual](https://github.com/ctubio/Krypto-trading-bot/blob/master/doc/MANUAL.md).

Troubleshooting:

 * If there is no wallet data on a given exchange, double-check the currency symbols with `--list` argument.

 Optional:

 * See at least once `./K.sh --help` to trade or `make help` to develop.

 * Use your own HTTP Basic Authentication credentials with `--user` and `--pass` arguments.

 * Use your own SSL certificate with `--ssl-crt` and `--ssl-key` arguments.<br>Otherwise, the insecure built-in certificate is fully featured, but you may need to authorise it in your browser.<br>If you want to generate your own certificate see [SSL for internal usage](https://www.akadia.com/services/ssh_test_certificate.html).<br>In case you really want to use plain HTTP, use `--without-ssl` argument.

### Upgrade to the latest commit

If you upgrade while having any instance running in the background, you will need to manually restart it using `make restart` or `make restartall` to start using the latest version.

#### Upgrade under Manual ZIP Installation:

Please run `make reinstall` to download the upgraded source and executable files.

#### Upgrade under Manual GIT Installation:

Feel free anytime to check if there are new upgrades with `make diff`.

Once you decide that it is time to upgrade, execute `make upgrade` (or directly `make reinstall` to skip the validation of new commits).

If you only use `git` to pull the latest source files from the remote branch, you will still need to upgrade or recompile your executable files.

To not upgrade but instead recompile your own modified source files, use `make lib K` or just `make` (see [Build notes](#build-notes)).

### Multiple instances party time

Please note, an ""instance"" is in fact a `*.sh` config file; using a single machine with a single installation, you can run as many instances as `*.sh` files you have (limited by the available free RAM).

You can list the current running instances with `make list`.

If you haven't defined a config file, `make start`, `make screen`, `make stop` and `make restart` will use the default config file `K.sh`.

To run multiple instances using a collection of config files:

1. Create a new config file with `cp etc/K.sh.dist X.sh && chmod +x X.sh` (use `X.sh` or any name but keep `.sh` extension).

2. Edit the new config file `vim X.sh`

3. Run the new instance with `./X.sh` or to run in the background, use `K=X.sh make start`. To attach to the new instance's screen, use `K=X.sh make screen`. To stop the new instance, use `K=X.sh make stop` and to restart it, use `K=X.sh make restart`. The environment variable `K` specifies the filename of the config file that you want to use.

4. Open in the web browser the different pages of the ports of the different running instances, or display the UI of all instances together in a single page using the MATRYOSHKA link in the footer (that can be predefined using the optional argument `--matryoshka=URL`).

After multiple config files are setup, to control them all together instead of one by one, the commands `make startall`, `make stopall` and `make restartall` are also available, just remember that config files with a filename starting with underscore symbol ""_"" will be skipped.

### Application Usage

1. Open your web browser to connect to port `3000` (or your configured port number) of the machine running K. Using `localhost` or one of the public or private IPs of your machine (if you're running on Docker, use the IP address returned by `boot2docker ip`).

2. Read up on how to use K and market making in the [manual](https://github.com/ctubio/Krypto-trading-bot/blob/master/doc/MANUAL.md).

3. Use the web UI to change the quoting parameters. Click the big ""BTC/USD"" button to start making markets. Click it again to stop. When the button is green, the bot is actively placing orders.

### Web UI

Once `K` is up and running, visit port `3000` (or your configured port number) to access the UI (i.e. [https://localhost:3000](https://localhost:3000)). There are inputs for quoting parameters, grids to display market orders, market trades, your trades, your order history, your positions, and a big button with the currency pair you are trading. When you're ready, click that button green to begin sending out quotes. The UI uses angularjs hydrated with websockets observed with reactivexjs.

### Databases

Each currency pair of each exchange will use a different sqlite database file with [WAL mode](https://www.sqlite.org/wal.html) enabled.

All database files are located at `/var/lib/K/db/K-*.db*`, outside the download folder to survive wild `rm -rf path/to/K` or reinstalls.

You can copy any group of `*.db*` files to another machine when migrating or as a backup.

If a database does not exist, the application will create it on boot; otherwise, it will use the existing one.

To explore each database you can use https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser or a similar tool.

To set a different database filename or to set an [in-memory database](https://sqlite.org/inmemorydb.html), use `--database=FILE` argument (see `--help`).

Even if using an in-memory database, the quoting parameters are always loaded from and saved into the file database.

### Charts

The metrics are not saved anywhere, it is just UI data collected with a visibility retention of `n` hours (where `n` is the value of `profit` quoting parameter), to display over time:

 * Market Fair Value with High and Low Prices
 * Trades Complete
 * Target Position for BTC currency (TBP)
 * Target Position for Fiat currency
 * STDEV and EWMA values for Quote Protection and APR
 * Amount available in wallet for buy
 * Amount held in open trades for buy
 * Amount available in wallet for sell
 * Amount held in open trades for sell
 * Total amount available and held at both sides in BTC currency
 * Total amount available and held at both sides in Fiat currency

### Cloud Hosting

If you ask me, [<img height=""20px"" src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1634027/29756933-3e64c62e-8ba8-11e7-916a-3b0ae1481a52.png"">](https://www.dreamhost.com/r.cgi?475987/cloud/) is a very nice web hosting company (awesome support team, awesome servers). Feel free to use this referral link to get a discount subtracted from my referral earnings (i'm a user since 2008).

### Build notes

Make sure your build machine has [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/) installed, also ensure `make lib` provides all dependencies without errors.

To rebuild the application, see `make help` and choose a target (just `make` may be what you are looking for).

Test units are executed before the application exits, only if the application was compiled with `KUNITS=1 make`.

Otherwise, just `make` without the environment var `KUNITS` produces an application that simply exits on exit.

A quick test runner therefore is `./K.sh --version` or the alias `make test` or all at once with `KUNITS=1 make K test`.

To pipe the output to stdout, execute the application in the foreground with `--naked` argument.

### Unlock

The bot is unlocked for collaborators and contributors (feel free to make acceptable Pull Requests for already opened issues or for anything you consider useful, and let me know the BTC Payment Address for the bot that you wish to unlock in the description of the PR, and I will credit it for you).

While locked, the orderbook will be in realtime 121 seconds, and later it will be updated only once every 121 seconds.

Anonymous users can also unlock any API Key by paying 0.00121000 BTC to the address displayed on exit.

Once unlocked you may use different bots or currency pairs or reinstall on a different machine with the same unlocked API Key. However, if you want to use more than one exchange, you will need to pay again to unlock the API Key for each exchange.

Otherwise if you choose to not support further development by ctubio, just keep running some old commit and do not upgrade (any commit prior to v0.3.0 was completely unlocked).

Please don't open issues asking how much % less the bot generates with `--free-version`; it is relative to your trading strategy, the market conditions, and the bot's performance.

95,95,PaulSonOfLars/tgbot,Python,"# tgbot
A modular telegram Python bot running on python3 with an sqlalchemy database.

Originally a simple group management bot with multiple admin features, it has evolved into becoming a basis for modular
bots aiming to provide simple plugin expansion via a simple drag and drop.

Can be found on telegram as [Marie](https://t.me/BanhammerMarie_bot).

For questions regarding creating your own bot, please head to [this chat](https://t.me/MarieOT) where you'll find a
group of volunteers to help. We'll also help when a database schema changes, and some table column needs to be
modified/added (this info can also be found in the commit messages)


Join the [news channel](https://t.me/MarieNews) if you just want to stay in the loop about new features or
announcements.

Marie and I can also be found moderating the [marie support group](https://t.me/MarieSupport) aimed at providing help
setting up Marie in your chats (*not* for bot clones).
Feel free to join to report bugs, and stay in the loop on the status of the bot development.

Note to maintainers that all schema changes will be found in the commit messages, and its their responsibility to read any new commits.


## IMPORTANT NOTICE:

This project is no longer under active maintenance. Occasional bug fixes may be released, but no new features are scheduled to be added.
Users of [Marie](https://t.me/BanhammerMarie_bot) are encouraged to migrate to [Rose](https://t.me/MissRose_bot), which
is the improved version of this project, written in golang, with scalability in mind.

## Starting the bot.

Once you've setup your database and your configuration (see below) is complete, simply run:

`python3 -m tg_bot`


## Setting up the bot (Read this before trying to use!):
Please make sure to use python3.6, as I cannot guarantee everything will work as expected on older python versions!
This is because markdown parsing is done by iterating through a dict, which are ordered by default in 3.6.

### Configuration

There are two possible ways of configuring your bot: a config.py file, or ENV variables.

The prefered version is to use a `config.py` file, as it makes it easier to see all your settings grouped together.
This file should be placed in your `tg_bot` folder, alongside the `__main__.py` file . 
This is where your bot token will be loaded from, as well as your database URI (if you're using a database), and most of 
your other settings.

It is recommended to import sample_config and extend the Config class, as this will ensure your config contains all 
defaults set in the sample_config, hence making it easier to upgrade.

An example `config.py` file could be:
```
from tg_bot.sample_config import Config


class Development(Config):
    OWNER_ID = 254318997  # my telegram ID
    OWNER_USERNAME = ""SonOfLars""  # my telegram username
    API_KEY = ""your bot api key""  # my api key, as provided by the botfather
    SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI = 'postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/database'  # sample db credentials
    MESSAGE_DUMP = '-1234567890' # some group chat that your bot is a member of
    USE_MESSAGE_DUMP = True
    SUDO_USERS = [18673980, 83489514]  # List of id's for users which have sudo access to the bot.
    LOAD = []
    NO_LOAD = ['translation']
```

If you can't have a config.py file (EG on heroku), it is also possible to use environment variables.
The following env variables are supported:
 - `ENV`: Setting this to ANYTHING will enable env variables

 - `TOKEN`: Your bot token, as a string.
 - `OWNER_ID`: An integer of consisting of your owner ID
 - `OWNER_USERNAME`: Your username

 - `DATABASE_URL`: Your database URL
 - `MESSAGE_DUMP`: optional: a chat where your replied saved messages are stored, to stop people deleting their old 
 - `LOAD`: Space separated list of modules you would like to load
 - `NO_LOAD`: Space separated list of modules you would like NOT to load
 - `WEBHOOK`: Setting this to ANYTHING will enable webhooks when in env mode
 messages
 - `URL`: The URL your webhook should connect to (only needed for webhook mode)

 - `SUDO_USERS`: A space separated list of user_ids which should be considered sudo users
 - `SUPPORT_USERS`: A space separated list of user_ids which should be considered support users (can gban/ungban,
 nothing else)
 - `WHITELIST_USERS`: A space separated list of user_ids which should be considered whitelisted - they can't be banned.
 - `DONATION_LINK`: Optional: link where you would like to receive donations.
 - `CERT_PATH`: Path to your webhook certificate
 - `PORT`: Port to use for your webhooks
 - `DEL_CMDS`: Whether to delete commands from users which don't have rights to use that command
 - `STRICT_GBAN`: Enforce gbans across new groups as well as old groups. When a gbanned user talks, he will be banned.
 - `WORKERS`: Number of threads to use. 8 is the recommended (and default) amount, but your experience may vary.
 __Note__ that going crazy with more threads wont necessarily speed up your bot, given the large amount of sql data 
 accesses, and the way python asynchronous calls work.
 - `BAN_STICKER`: Which sticker to use when banning people.
 - `ALLOW_EXCL`: Whether to allow using exclamation marks ! for commands as well as /.

### Python dependencies

Install the necessary python dependencies by moving to the project directory and running:

`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.

This will install all necessary python packages.

### Database

If you wish to use a database-dependent module (eg: locks, notes, userinfo, users, filters, welcomes),
you'll need to have a database installed on your system. I use postgres, so I recommend using it for optimal compatibility.

In the case of postgres, this is how you would set up a the database on a debian/ubuntu system. Other distributions may vary.

- install postgresql:

`sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install postgresql`

- change to the postgres user:

`sudo su - postgres`

- create a new database user (change YOUR_USER appropriately):

`createuser -P -s -e YOUR_USER`

This will be followed by you needing to input your password.

- create a new database table:

`createdb -O YOUR_USER YOUR_DB_NAME`

Change YOUR_USER and YOUR_DB_NAME appropriately.

- finally:

`psql YOUR_DB_NAME -h YOUR_HOST YOUR_USER`

This will allow you to connect to your database via your terminal.
By default, YOUR_HOST should be 0.0.0.0:5432.

You should now be able to build your database URI. This will be:

`sqldbtype://username:pw@hostname:port/db_name`

Replace sqldbtype with whichever db youre using (eg postgres, mysql, sqllite, etc)
repeat for your username, password, hostname (localhost?), port (5432?), and db name.

## Modules
### Setting load order.

The module load order can be changed via the `LOAD` and `NO_LOAD` configuration settings.
These should both represent lists.

If `LOAD` is an empty list, all modules in `modules/` will be selected for loading by default.

If `NO_LOAD` is not present, or is an empty list, all modules selected for loading will be loaded.

If a module is in both `LOAD` and `NO_LOAD`, the module will not be loaded - `NO_LOAD` takes priority.

### Creating your own modules.

Creating a module has been simplified as much as possible - but do not hesitate to suggest further simplification.

All that is needed is that your .py file be in the modules folder.

To add commands, make sure to import the dispatcher via

`from tg_bot import dispatcher`.

You can then add commands using the usual

`dispatcher.add_handler()`.

Assigning the `__help__` variable to a string describing this modules' available
commands will allow the bot to load it and add the documentation for
your module to the `/help` command. Setting the `__mod_name__` variable will also allow you to use a nicer, user
friendly name for a module.

The `__migrate__()` function is used for migrating chats - when a chat is upgraded to a supergroup, the ID changes, so 
it is necessary to migrate it in the db.

The `__stats__()` function is for retrieving module statistics, eg number of users, number of chats. This is accessed 
through the `/stats` command, which is only available to the bot owner.

# Using service accounts for uploading to avoid user rate limit
For Service Account to work, you must set USE_SERVICE_ACCOUNTS=""True"" in config file or environment variables
Many thanks to [AutoRClone](https://github.com/xyou365/AutoRclone) for the scripts
**NOTE:** Using service accounts is only recommended while uploading to a team drive.
## Generating service accounts
Step 1. Generate service accounts [What is service account](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-accounts)
---------------------------------
Let us create only the service accounts that we need. 
**Warning:** abuse of this feature is not the aim of this project and we do **NOT** recommend that you make a lot of projects, just one project and 100 sa allow you plenty of use, its also possible that over abuse might get your projects banned by google. 

```
Note: 1 service account can copy around 750gb a day, 1 project can make 100 service accounts so that's 75tb a day, for most users this should easily suffice. 
```

`python3 gen_sa_accounts.py --quick-setup 1 --new-only`

A folder named accounts will be created which will contain keys for the service accounts

NOTE: If you have created SAs in past from this script, you can also just re download the keys by running:
```
python3 gen_sa_accounts.py --download-keys project_id
```

### Add all the service accounts to the Team Drive
- Run:
```
python3 add_to_team_drive.py -d SharedTeamDriveSrcID
```

# Youtube-dl authentication using .netrc file
For using your premium accounts in youtube-dl, edit the netrc file (in the root directory of this repository) according to following format:
```

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Haehnchen/crypto-trading-bot.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Haehnchen/crypto-trading-bot)

A **work in progress** Cryptocurrency for common exchanges like Bitfinex, Bitmex and Binance.
As most trading bots just provide basic buy and sell signals they provide many stuff to get profitable eg exchange orders like stop-losses or stop-limits are not supported by main bots. Also the limitation of fixed timeframe and technical indicators must be broken

**Not production ready** only basic functionality

## Features

- Fully use Websocket for exchange communication to react as fast as possible on market
- Multi pair support in one instance
- sqlite3 storage for candles, tickers, ...
- Webserver UI
- Support for going ""Short"" and ""Long""
- Signal browser dashboard for pairs
- Slack and email notification
- Join foreign exchange candles (eg. Trade on Bitmex with the faster moving Binance trades / candles)
- TODO: Show possible arbitrage trades

### Exchanges

- [Bitmex](https://www.bitmex.com/register/jS4mLN) with leverage configuration
- [Bitmex Testnet](https://www.bitmex.com/register/jS4mLN)

TODOS:

- [Huobi Global](https://www.hbg.com/) (margin)

## Technical stuff and packages

- node.js
- sqlite3
- [technicalindicators](https://github.com/anandanand84/technicalindicators)
- [tulipindicators - tulind](https://tulipindicators.org/list)
- [TA-Lib](https://mrjbq7.github.io/ta-lib/)
- twig
- express
- Bootstrap v4
- Tradingview widgets

## How to use

### [optional] Preinstall

The tulip library is used for indicators; which sometimes is having some issues on `npm install` because of code compiling:

Install build tools

```
sudo apt-get install build-essential
```

The nodejs wrapper for tulipindicators is called [Tulip Node (tuind)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tulind), check out installation instructions there.

Also the build from source is not supporting all nodejs version. It looks like versions <= 10 are working. You can use nodejs 12 if you compiled it once via older version.

### Install packages

```
➜ npm install --production
➜ npm run postinstall
```

Create instance file for pairs and changes

```
cp instance.js.dist instance.js
```

Provide a configuration with your exchange credentials

```
cp conf.json.dist conf.json
```

Create a new sqlite database use bot.sql scheme to create the tables

```
sqlite3 bot.db < bot.sql
```

Lets start it

```
npm start
```

## How to use: Docker

For initialize the configuration once

```
➜ cp instance.js.dist instance.js && cp conf.json.dist conf.json && sqlite3 bot.db < bot.sql
➜ docker-compose build
➜ docker-compose up -d
```

After this you can use `docker-compose` which will give you a running bot via <http://127.0.0.1:8080>

## Setting Up Telegram Bot

First, you'll need to create a bot for Telegram. Just talk to [BotFather](https://telegram.me/botfather) and follow simple steps until it gives you a token for it.
You'll also need to create a Telegram group, the place where you and crypto-trading-bot will communicate. After creating it, add the bot as administrator (make sure to uncheck ""All Members Are Admins"").

### Retrieving Chat IDs

Invite `@RawDataBot` to your group and get your group id in sended chat id field

```text
Message
 ├ message_id: 338
 ├ from
 ┊  ├ id: *****
 ┊  ├ is_bot: false
 ┊  ├ first_name: 사이드
 ┊  ├ username: ******
 ┊  └ language_code: en
 ├ chat
 ┊  ├ id: -1001118554477
 ┊  ├ title: Test Group
 ┊  └ type: supergroup
 ├ date: 1544948900
 └ text: A
```

Look for id: -1001118554477 is your chat id (with the negative sign).

### Log messages to Telegram

For example setup, check `conf.json.dist file`, log.telegram section , set chatId, token, level (default is info). Check more options https://github.com/ivanmarban/winston-telegram#readme

## Webserver

Some browser links

- UI: http://127.0.0.1:8080
- Signals: http://127.0.0.1:8080/signals
- Tradingview: http://127.0.0.1:8080/tradingview/BTCUSD
- Backtesting: http://127.0.0.1:8080/backtest
- Order & Pair Management: http://127.0.0.1:8080/pairs

### Security / Authentication

As the webserver provides just basic auth for access you should combine some with eh a https for public server. Here s simple `proxy_pass` for nginx.

```
# /etc/nginx/sites-available/YOURHOST
server {
    server_name YOURHOST;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8080;
    }

    listen 443 ssl; # managed by Certbot
    ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/YOURHOST/fullchain.pem; # managed by Certbot
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/YOURHOST/privkey.pem; # managed by Certbot
    include /etc/letsencrypt/options-ssl-nginx.conf; # managed by Certbot
    ssl_dhparam /etc/letsencrypt/ssl-dhparams.pem; # managed by Certbot
}

```

You should also set the listen ip to a local one

```
# config.json
webserver.ip: 127.0.0.1

```

## Build In Strategies

Common strategy with indicators are inside, which most of the time are not profitable. See some more advanced strategy in the list below

- [dip_catcher](src/modules/strategy/strategies/dip_catcher/README.md)
- [dca_dipper](src/modules/strategy/strategies/dca_dipper/README.md) - **Long term invest** Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) Dip Investor Strategy

Find some example strategies inside [src/modules/strategy/strategies](src/modules/strategy/strategies)

## Custom Strategies

For custom strategies use [var/strategies](var/strategies) folder.

```
# simple file structure
var/strategies/your_strategy.js

# or wrap strategy into any sub folder depth
var/strategies/my_strategy/my_strategy.js
var/strategies/subfolder1/our_strategy/our_strategy.js
```

## Tools / Watchdog

- `order_adjust` Keep open orders in bid / ask of the orderbook in first position

### Watchdog

- `stoploss` provide general stoploss order in percent of entry price (Exchange Order)
- `risk_reward_ratio` Creates Risk Reward order for take profit and stoploss (Exchange Order Limit+Stop)
- `stoploss_watch` Close open position if ticker price falls below the percent lose; use this for exchange that dont support stop_loss order liek Binance
- `trailing_stop` Use native exchange trailing stop; if supported by exchange eg `Bitfinex`

```
    'watchdogs': [
        {
            'name': 'stoploss',
            'percent': 3,
        },
        {
            'name': 'risk_reward_ratio',
            'target_percent': 6,
            'stop_percent': 3,
        },
        {
            'name': 'stoploss_watch',
            'stop': 1.2,
        },
        {
            'name': 'trailing_stop',
            'target_percent': 1.2,
            'stop_percent': 0.5
        }
    ],
```

### Tick Interval

Per default every strategy is ""ticked"" every full minute with a ~10sec time window. If you want to tick every 15 minutes or less see possible examples below.

Supported units are ""m"" (minute) and ""s"" (seconds)

```json
{
  ""strategies"": [
    {
      ""strategy"": ""cci"",
      ""interval"": ""15m""
    },
    {
      ""strategy"": ""cci2"",
      ""interval"": ""30s""
    },
    {
      ""strategy"": ""cci3"",
      ""interval"": ""60m""
    }
  ]
}
```

## Trading

### Capital

To allow the bot to trade you need to give some ""playing capital"". You can allow to by via asset or currency amount, see examples below.
You should only provide one of them, first wins.

```
    c.symbols.push({
        'symbol': 'BTC-EUR',
        'exchange': 'coinbase_pro',
        'trade': {
            'capital': 0.015, // this will buy 0.015 BTC
            'currency_capital': 50,  // this will use 50 EUR and buys the equal amount of BTC (example: BTC price 3000 use 50 EUR. will result in 0.016 BTC)
            'balance_percent': 75,  // this will use 75 % of your exchange margin tradable balance. Currently implemented only on Bitfinex exchange.
        },
    })
```

### Live Strategy

Every strategy stat should be live must be places inside `trade`.

```json
{
  ""trade"": {
    ""strategies"": [
      {
        ""strategy"": ""dip_catcher"",
        ""interval"": ""15m"",
        ""options"": {
          ""period"": ""15m""
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Inside logs, visible via browser ui, you can double check the strategies init process after the application started.

```
[info] Starting strategy intervals
[info] ""binance_futures"" - ""ETHUSDT"" - ""trade"" - init strategy ""dip_catcher"" (15m) in 11.628 minutes
[info] ""binance_futures"" - ""BTCUSDT"" - ""trade"" first strategy run ""dip_catcher"" now every 15.00 minutes
```

### Full Trade Example

An example `instance.js` which trades can be found inside `instance.js.dist_trade`. Rename it or move the content to you file.

```js
const c = (module.exports = {});

c.symbols = [
  {
    symbol: 'ETHUSDT',
    exchange: 'binance_futures',
    periods: ['1m', '15m', '1h'],
    trade: {
      currency_capital: 10,
      strategies: [
        {
          strategy: 'dip_catcher',
          interval: '15m',
          options: {
            period: '15m'
          }
        }
      ]
    },
    watchdogs: [
      {
        name: 'risk_reward_ratio',
        target_percent: 3.1,
        stop_percent: 2.1
      }
    ]
  }
];
```

### Margin / Leverage

Per pair you can set used margin before orders are created; depending on exchange

```
    c.symbols.push({
        'symbol': 'BTCUSD',
        'exchange': 'bitmex',
        'extra': {
            'bitmex_leverage': 5,
        },
    })

    c.symbols.push({
        'symbol': 'EOSUSD',
        'exchange': 'bybit',
        'extra': {
            'bybit_leverage': 5,
        },
    })
```

## Tools

### Fill data

_outdated_, but there as an automatic filling on startup ~1000 candles from the past (depending on exchange) and continuously fetched when running

```
node index.js backfill -e bitmex -p 1m -s XRPZ18
```

## Signals

### Slack

![Webserver UI](documentation/slack_signals.png 'Slack signals')

98,98,tdlib/telegram-bot-api,C++,"# Telegram Bot API

The Telegram Bot API provides an HTTP API for creating [Telegram Bots](https://core.telegram.org/bots).

If you've got any questions about bots or would like to report an issue with your bot, kindly contact us at [@BotSupport](https://t.me/BotSupport) in Telegram.

Please note that only global Bot API issues that affect all bots are suitable for this repository.

<a name=""installation""></a>
## Installation

The simplest way to build and install `Telegram Bot API server` is to use our [Telegram Bot API server build instructions generator](https://tdlib.github.io/telegram-bot-api/build.html).
If you do that, you'll only need to choose the target operating system to receive the complete build instructions.

In general, you need to install all `Telegram Bot API server` [dependencies](#dependencies) and compile the source code using CMake:

```sh
git clone --recursive https://github.com/tdlib/telegram-bot-api.git
cd telegram-bot-api
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
cmake --build . --target install
```

<a name=""dependencies""></a>
## Dependencies
To build and run `Telegram Bot API server` you will need:

* OpenSSL
* zlib
* C++14 compatible compiler (e.g., Clang 3.4+, GCC 4.9+, MSVC 19.0+ (Visual Studio 2015+), Intel C++ Compiler 17+) (build only)
* gperf (build only)
* CMake (3.0.2+, build only)

<a name=""usage""></a>
## Usage

Use `telegram-bot-api --help` to receive the list of all available options of the Telegram Bot API server.

The only mandatory options are `--api-id` and `--api-hash`. You must obtain your own `api_id` and `api_hash`
as described in https://core.telegram.org/api/obtaining_api_id and specify them using the `--api-id` and `--api-hash` options
or the `TELEGRAM_API_ID` and `TELEGRAM_API_HASH` environment variables.

To enable Bot API features not available at `https://api.telegram.org`, specify the option `--local`. In the local mode the Bot API server allows to:
* Download files without a size limit.
* Upload files up to 2000 MB.
* Upload files using their local path and [the file URI scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_URI_scheme).
* Use an HTTP URL for the webhook.
* Use any local IP address for the webhook.
* Use any port for the webhook.
* Set *max_webhook_connections* up to 100000.
* Receive the absolute local path as a value of the *file_path* field without the need to download the file after a *getFile* request.

The Telegram Bot API server accepts only HTTP requests, so a TLS termination proxy needs to be used to handle remote HTTPS requests.

By default the Telegram Bot API server is launched on the port 8081, which can be changed using the option `--http-port`.

<a name=""switching""></a>
## Moving a bot to a local server

To guarantee that your bot will receive all updates, you must deregister it with the `https://api.telegram.org` server by calling the method [logOut](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#logout).
After the bot is logged out, you can replace the address to which the bot sends requests with the address of your local server and use it in the usual way.
If the server is launched in `--local` mode, make sure that the bot can correctly handle absolute file paths in response to `getFile` requests.

<a name=""moving""></a>
## Moving a bot from one local server to another

If the bot is logged in on more than one server simultaneously, there is no guarantee that it will receive all updates.
To move a bot from one local server to another you can use the method [logOut](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#logout) to log out on the old server before switching to the new one.

If you want to avoid losing updates between logging out on the old server and launching on the new server, you can remove the bot's webhook using the method
[deleteWebhook](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#deletewebhook), then use the method [close](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#close) to close the bot instance.
After the instance is closed, locate the bot's subdirectory in the working directory of the old server by the bot's user ID, move the subdirectory to the working directory of the new server
and continue sending requests to the new server as usual.

99,99,google/bottery,JavaScript,"# Bottery

## A conversational agent prototyping platform by [Kate Compton](https://github.com/galaxykate).

(This is not an official Google product.)

## What is this?

Bottery is a syntax, editor, and simulator for prototyping **generative contextual conversations** modeled as **finite state machines**.

Bottery takes inspiration from the **[Tracery](http://tracery.io/)** open-source project for generative text (also by katecompton@ in a non-google capacity) and the [Cheap Bots, Done Quick!](https://cheapbotsdonequick.com/) bot-hosting platform, as well as open FSM-based storytelling tools like Twine.  

Like Tracery, Bottery is a *syntax* that specifies the script of a conversation (a *map*) with JSON.  Like Cheap Bots, Done Quick!, the BotteryStudio can take that JSON and run a simulation of that conversation in a nice JavaScript front-end, with helpful visualizations and editing ability.

The goal of Bottery is to help *everyone*, from designers to writers to coders, be able to write simple and engaging  contextual conversational agents, and to test them out in a realistic interactive simulation, mimicking how they'd work on a ""real"" platform like DialogFlow.  


## Bottery concepts

Users in Tracery write **grammars**, JSON objects that recursively define how to generate some text, like [the musings of a lost self-driving car](https://cheapbotsdonequick.com/source/losttesla) or [outer-space adventures](https://cheapbotsdonequick.com/source/tinyadv).  Tracery grammars are lists of symbol names (like ""animal"") and their expansion rules (like ""emu, okapi, pangolin"").

In Bottery, users write **maps**. Each map is composed of four sub-components
* A set of **states**, with information about what to do on entering them, and how to get from one to another
* A set of initial **blackboard** values
* An optional Tracery **grammar**

### Blackboard (and the pointer)

You can imagine a Bottery map like a finite state machine or a [boardgame board](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/361273201334614541/?lp=true): there are spaces, and connections between the spaces, and rules for how to move between them.  The map itself doesn't change or store information during play.  Instead, you have a **pointer** showing which state you are on, all the variables in the blackboard (like the number of kids in your Game of Life car).

An RPG map might use the blackboard to store the number of hit points for the main character, their current weapon and its stats, their gold, and quest progress.  A quiz bot might store all of its categories, questions and answers, the players' current points, and which questions it wants to ask next.  You can store strings, booleans, numbers, hierarchical objects, and arrays in the blackboard.  Storing and retrieving information is done with a JavaScript-like syntax: `foo.bar[5]` gets the value at the 5th index of object `bar` in object `foo`.  `foo.baz[10][20] = 10` behaves similarly, though unlike JavaScript, if these parameters don't exist, it will create new objects or arrays and fill them rather than throwing an error. See `parseMapPath` in `map.js` for details.

Variables in the blackboard can be accessed from within Tracery with the syntax `You have guessed #/guessCount# times.`

### States

Each state is a node in the Bottery map. A state has
* An **id**
* A list of **actions** to be taken when the state is entered
* A dictionary of **exits** to other states.
* Optionally, a list of **suggestion chips** (using tracery syntax) of suggested user inputs. This is commonly used in text based bots.

There are several ways to express the actions that are taken when the state is entered, depending on the desired behavior. The following are currently defined:
* `onEnter`: This takes a string of actions defined in the action syntax (see below). For example: `“‘hello’ greeting++”`. these are space delineated commands, and the extra quotation marks around the phrase are necessary
* `onEnterDoOne` Takes an array of strings in format `""[condition] [action]""`. The first condition that evaluates to true has its action executed.
* `onEnterSay` Takes a singe string and outputs it. The string can use tracery expansion syntax.
* `onEnterPlay` Plays the audio file specified.
* `onEnterFxn` Executes the given function (but must be defined in `map.js`)

All bots must have an `origin` state, which is the first state entered when the bot starts.

### Exits

Exits are described by strings in the format:
`[conditions] ->TARGET_NAME [actions to take when taken]`

Syntax for actions and conditions are described below.

If all the conditions are true then the exit becomes active. If there are *no* conditions, the exit is always active.

Then there is an arrow (`->`) and a target.  The target is either an **id of a state** or an at sign `@` that indicates the pointer should re-enter the current state.

The list of actions is in **action syntax** (see below).

### Condition

Conditions fall under the following categories:
* Inputs: User input matching a string. E.g., `""one""` or `""two""`. The presence of quotes indicates a string that must be matched by the last user input. An asterisk `*` matches *any* user input.
* Expressions: Mathematical syntax representing equality, inequality, and so on. Most basic math expressions are valid e.g. `count>4`. Expressions can use variables that exist in the blackboard, using the blackboard variable syntax (see above). 
* Values: There is only one type of these at present, `wait:[time in seconds to wait]`. This evaluates to true after that much time has elapsed after entering the current state.

### Actions

Action syntax is similar to condition syntax:
* Assignment: Sets a variable in the blackboard. If the variable does not exist it is created. E.g. `partyMember[1].weapon=""sword""`.
* Output: Raw text with quotes is outputted using selected output method. ‘""hello""’. This uses tracery expansion syntax, so `""hello #/playerName#""`
* Play sound: `playSound([sound name])`
* Incrementation: Increments or decrements a variable in the blackboard. E.g.:`[varName]++` or `[varName]--`

### How the pointer decides how to move

When the pointer enters a state, the following things happen:
1. Any `onEnter` actions are executed.
2. Any **suggestion chips** are created and displayed to the user.
3. All available exits (including the exits specified in the state, as well as global exits) are collected.

The pointer then waits for state change. At the moment, state change includes user input, and the passage of time. If no `wait` conditions are present, then the bot will wait for user input forever. When that state change occurs, the pointer will re-evaluate all the conditions on the currently available exits. If all the conditions on an exit evaluate to true, then that exit becomes active.

It is often the case that multiple exits are active at the same time. For example:
`""yes"" ->startGame`
`* ->askForClarification`

If the user types ""yes"", both exits are active. The first exit in in the list of active exits is selected. In this case `""yes"" ->startGame` will be chosen.

When the pointer uses an exit, the following occurs:
1. The actions associated with the exit are executed.
2. The pointer moves to the state of that exit and the process begins anew.

## Interface Overview

![UI overview](doc_images/bottery_ui.png?raw=true)

### Chat

Tab for interacting with the bot. Occasionally, the player may be offered suggestion chips (e.g., ""heads"" and ""tails"") that can allow the player to interact without entering text.

### Controls

Switches between text and speech, and also commands for working with state.
If there are errors in the bot’s underlying script, then they will appear here.

### Editor

An inline editor for the underlying bot script. A user can edit the script and see changes without having to edit the underlying `.js` files. Changes here will be saved in local storage, so they will only be accessible to the current user.

### Blackboard

Displays the current state of the variables known by the bot. These variables can be used to affect conditional behavior (e.g., the mood of the bot), some tracked information (e.g., the number of correct guesses in a quiz), the name of something (e.g., something the player is allowed to name), and much more.

This information is typically invisible to an end user interacting with the bot.

### Inspector

Presents a view of the bot’s state machine. This shows all the states that the bot can traverse through, and within them indicates the commands that are executed by the bot, and the ways to traverse to the next state[s]. The initial state is always ""origin"". This view is not interactive, but is a visual representation of the underlying script.

### State view

This is a representation of the current state of the bot, and the potential next states, as well as the conditions for enabling these particular transitions.

Displays the directed connectivity graph of states and exits. Highlights the current state and any active exit transitions.

## Example bot (kitten simulator!)

Now that we have reviewed the underlying concepts and the interface, it is time to build a bot!

When you have checked out the git repository, create a new file `kittens.js` in the `bots` directory, and add `kittens` to the list of bots in `bots.js`.

We can start with the following in `kittens.js`:

```javascript
bot = {
  states: {
    origin: {
      onEnter: ""'You have a kitten!'"",
    },
  },
}
```

This is a minimal valid bot. It has one state, the `origin`, and that has a single `onEnter` associated with it. Note the fact that the text `'You have a kitten!'` is in single quotes. This is an output action and denotes that this string is to be output as text. We will add additional actions later.

A note on syntax: The format of this is valid javascript, and is very similar to JSON, but is not valid JSON because of two key differences: trailing commas are permitted, and object keys do not require quotes.

### Interactive kitten

A bot isn't very interesting until you can interact with it, so let's add some interactivity:

```javascript
bot = {
  states: {
    origin: {
      onEnter: ""'You have a kitten!'"",
      exits: ""->name"",
    },
    name: {
      onEnter: ""'What do you want to name your kitten?'"",
      exits: ""'*' ->respondToName name=INPUT"",
    },
    respondToName: {
      onEnterSay: ""The kitten purrs happily, I guess it likes the name #/name#!"",
    },
  },
}
```

This example introduces two new states: `name` and `respondToName`. These states are connected via `exits`. The exit on `origin` has no conditions, and therefore is entered immediately by the Pointer. The exit in the state `name` requires some form of user input indicated by the asterisk. This exit has an action associated with it in the form `name=INPUT`. `INPUT` is a special variable indicating the user's input. `name=INPUT` has the effect that the variable `name` is assigned to what the user entered, and is saved in the blackboard. In state `respondToName` there is an `onEnterSay` behavior, which is similar to `onEnter`, but does not require extra single quotes around the text outputted. The blackboard variable `name` is accessed via Tracery syntax using `#/name#`.

Interacting with this bot, you can see that the **viz** view displays the state graph, and the blackboard view displays the user-entered name.

### Suggestion chips

User interactions can be expedited though the use of suggestion chips. These are prompts that are shown to the user when interacting through text. 

```javascript
bot = {
  states: {
    origin: {
      onEnter: ""'You have a kitten!'"",
      exits: ""->name"",
    },
    name: {
      onEnter: ""'What do you want to name your kitten?'"",
      chips: [""Cupcake"", ""Dark Lord Satan""],
      exits: ""'*' ->respond_to_name name=INPUT"",
    },
    respond_to_name: {
      onEnterSay: ""The kitten purrs happily, I guess it likes the name #/name#!"",
    },
  },
}
```

### Adding Tracery grammar

A little more flavor can be added using a Tracery grammar:

```javascript
bot = {
  grammar: {
    noun: [""cat"", ""monkey"",""butter"", ""pants"", ""demon"", ""fluff"", ""taco"", ""mountain"", ""butt""],
    adj: [""fluffy"", ""fat"", ""puff"", ""tepid"", ""love"", ""unruly""],
    name: [""#noun.capitalize##noun#"", ""#adj.capitalize##noun#"", ""#noun.capitalize# the #adj.capitalize#""],
  },
  states: {
    origin: {
      onEnter: ""'You have a kitten!'"",
      exits: ""->name"",
    },
    name: {
      onEnter: ""'What do you want to name your kitten?'"",
      chips: [""#name#"", ""#name#"", ""Cupcake"", ""Dark Lord Satan""],
      exits: ""'*' ->respond_to_name name=INPUT"",
    },
    respond_to_name: {
      onEnterSay: ""The kitten purrs happily, I guess it likes the name #/name#!"",
    },
  },
}
```

![](doc_images/kittens2.png?raw=true)

### Petting the kitten

What are some of the things that a user might want to do with a kitten bot? A natural thing to do would be to pet the kitten. Real life kittens are temperamental creatures, and can behave unpredictably. We can use the blackboard to store a variable indicating the number of times the kitten wants to be petted, and anything beyond that will cause the kitten to bite the user.

```javascript
bot = {
  grammar: {
    noun: [""cat"", ""monkey"",""butter"", ""pants"", ""demon"", ""fluff"", ""taco"", ""mountain"", ""butt""],
    adj: [""fluffy"", ""fat"", ""puff"", ""tepid"", ""love"", ""unruly""],
    name: [""#noun.capitalize##noun#"", ""#adj.capitalize##noun#"", ""#noun.capitalize# the #adj.capitalize#""],
  },
  states: {
    origin: {
      onEnter: ""'You have a kitten!' desired_pets=randomInt(1,5)"",
      exits: ""->name"",
    },
    name: {
      onEnter: ""'What do you want to name your kitten?'"",
      chips: [""#name#"", ""#name#"", ""Cupcake"", ""Dark Lord Satan""],
      exits: ""'*' ->respond_to_name name=INPUT"",
    },
    respond_to_name: {
      onEnterSay: ""The kitten purrs happily, I guess it likes the name #/name#!"",
    },
    pet: {
      onEnter: ""'You pet the kitten' desired_pets--"",
      exits: [""desired_pets>=0 ->happy_pet"", ""->angry_pet""]
    },
    happy_pet: {
      onEnterSay: ""#/name# loves you and is in ecstacy"",
    },
    angry_pet: {
      onEnterSay: ""why did you pet #/name# when it didn't want to be petted!?"",
      onEnter: ""desired_pets=randomInt(1,5)"",
    }
  },
  exits: ""'pet' ->pet"",
  initialBlackboard: {
    name: ""the kitten"",
  },
}
```

This example adds a global exit. No matter where the Pointer is at on the graph, the user can always pet the kitten. This introduces a problem, though, because the user could potentially pet the kitten before it was named, so an initial value for the name is configured in the blackboard. When the origin is entered, the variable `desired_pets` is set to a random value between 1 and 5. When the user pets the kitten too much, the `angry_pet` node is entered. 

![](doc_images/kittens3.png?raw=true)

### State flow

Finally, we should add some idle behavior for the kitten when it is not being petted.

```javascript
bot = {
  grammar: {
    noun: [""cat"", ""monkey"",""butter"", ""pants"", ""demon"", ""fluff"", ""taco"", ""mountain"", ""butt""],
    adj: [""fluffy"", ""fat"", ""puff"", ""tepid"", ""love"", ""unruly""],
    name: [""#noun.capitalize##noun#"", ""#adj.capitalize##noun#"", ""#noun.capitalize# the #adj.capitalize#""],
    catSpeak: [""mmrrr"", ""meow"", ""mmrrrrow"", ""meep"", ""#catSpeak# #catSpeak#""],
  },
  states: {
    origin: {
      onEnter: ""'You have a kitten!' desired_pets=randomInt(1,5)"",
      exits: ""->name"",
    },
    name: {
      onEnter: ""'What do you want to name your kitten?'"",
      chips: [""#name#"", ""#name#"", ""Cupcake"", ""Dark Lord Satan""],
      exits: ""'*' ->respond_to_name name=INPUT"",
    },
    respond_to_name: {
      onEnterSay: ""The kitten purrs happily, I guess it likes the name #/name#!"",
      exits: ""->idle""
    },
    pet: {
      onEnter: ""'You pet the kitten' desired_pets--"",
      exits: [""desired_pets>=0 ->happy_pet"", ""->angry_pet""]
    },
    happy_pet: {
      onEnterSay: ""#/name# loves you and is in ecstacy"",
      exits: ""wait:10 ->idle""
    },
    angry_pet: {
      onEnterSay: ""why did you pet #/name# when it didn't want to be petted!?"",
      onEnter: ""desired_pets=randomInt(1,5)"",
      exits: ""->angry""
    },
    idle: {
      onEnterSay: ""#/name# rolls around and makes cute noises"",
      exits: ""wait:10 ->hungry"",
    },
    angry: {
      onEnter: ""'The kitten is angry! *bite*'"",
      exits: ""wait:10 ->sleeping"",
    },
    sleeping: {
      onEnter: ""'The kitten is sleeping! zzzzzzzzz'"",
      exits: ""wait:10 ->hungry"",
    },
    hungry: {
      onEnter: ""'The kitten is hungry! meow meow #catSpeak#'"",
      exits: ""wait:10 ->angry"",
    },
  },
  exits: ""'pet' ->pet"",
  initialBlackboard: {
    name: ""the kitten"",
  },
}
```

This final example adds state transitions that form a cycle of activity. If no interaction occurs, the kitten will naturally cycle between the states of `hungry`, `sleeping`, and `angry`. The `wait:10` condition on the exit will delay for a particular amount of time before automatically advancing into that state.

# About:
  This is an open-source bot, the code is open for anyone to see, fork and
update.
  As the developer, I created this bot just for my personal use, I decided to
publish to help other people and maybe get a few bucks in donation.  As the
time went by, more and more people started opening issues, asking for help and
suggesting changes.
  I try to answer everyone, but lately it has been hard to keep  up. As the
only donation I received so far amounts to only 1 BCOIN and the bot
currently works perfectly for me. I am not feeling to motivated to spend the
time it needs to maintain the bot. I would like to keep this bot free and open
source, so as an incentive for me to spend the time and energy maintaining the
bot, I have created some donation milestones so people can collectively fund
the bot.

# Installation:
### Download and install Phython from the [site](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or from the [windows store](https://www.microsoft.com/p/python-37/9nj46sx7x90p?activetab=pivot:overviewtab). 

If you download from the site it is important to tick the option ""add python
to path"":
![Check Add python to PATH](https://github.com/mpcabete/bombcrypto-bot/raw/ee1b3890e67bc30e372359db9ae3feebc9c928d8/readme-images/path.png)

### Download the code as a zip file and extract it.

### Copy the path of the bot directory:

![caminho](https://github.com/mpcabete/bombcrypto-bot/raw/main/readme-images/address.png)

### Open the terminal.

Press the windows key + R and type ""cmd"":

![launch terminal](https://github.com/mpcabete/bombcrypto-bot/raw/main/readme-images/cmd.png)

### cd into the bot directory:
Type the command:

```
cd <path you copied>
```

![cd](https://github.com/mpcabete/bombcrypto-bot/raw/main/readme-images/cd.png)

### Install the dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

  
![pip](https://github.com/mpcabete/bombcrypto-bot/raw/main/readme-images/pip.png)

### It is finished! Now to run the bot you just need to type:

```
python index.py
```

![run](https://github.com/mpcabete/bombcrypto-bot/raw/main/readme-images/run.png)


# How to use?

Abra o terminal, se ainda não tiver navegado para a pasta do bot dê novamente o comando
Open the terminal, cd into the folder if you haven't yet:

```
""cd"" + path
```

To run it use the command

```
python index.py
```

As soon as you start the bot it will send the heroes to work. For it to work the game window needs to be visible.
It will constantly check if it needs to login or press the ""new map"" button. 
From 15 to 15 min it will send all heroes to work again


# Send home feature:

## How to use it:
Save a screenshot of the heroes you want to be sent home in the directory: /targets/heroes-to-send-home


## How it should behave:
It will automatically  load the screenshots of the heroes when starting up.
After it clicks in the heroes with the green bar to send them to work, it will look if there is any of the heroes that are saved in the directory in the screen.
If tit finds one of the heroes, the bot checks if the home button is dark and the work button is not dark.
If both these conditions are true, it clicks the home button.

## Troubleshooting:
#### I have not been able to fine adjust it, so here is some problems that may occur, and how to solve them:

- The bot should distinguish between the dark, the clear and the gray home buttons.
  - If the bot says that a hero is working or home, but he is not, that is because the bot is not detecting the dark home button, make the option ""home: home_button_trashhold"" smaller. You can also replace the image send-home.png in the targets folder.

  - If the bot is trapped in an loop clicking in an clear home button, he thinks that the clear button is the dark button, make the option home: home_button_trashhold bigger.

- The bot should detect the heroes you saved to the directory.
  - If the bot clicks the wrong heroes, it thinks that another hero is the one you saved the screenshot. Make the option home: hero_trashhold bigger
  - If it does not detect your heroes, make it smaller. You can also try replacing the screenshot with another part of the hero.

# mention-bot [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/facebook/mention-bot.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/facebook/mention-bot)

Do you have a GitHub project that is too big for people to subscribe to all the notifications? The mention bot will automatically mention potential reviewers on pull requests. It helps getting faster turnaround on pull requests by involving the right people early on.

<img width=""769"" src=""https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/197597/11023035/a2f8733e-8622-11e5-84df-49a3d9425938.png"">

## How To Use?

- Go to
 - your project on GitHub > Settings > Webhooks & services > Add Webhook or
 - your organization on GitHub > Settings > Webhooks > Add Webhook
- Payload URL: (https://mention-bot.herokuapp.com/)
- Content type: `application/json`
- Secret: Leave blank
- Let me select individual events > Check `Pull Request`
- Add Webhook

And you are done. Next time a pull request is opened, you should see the bot add a comment ;)

## Configuration

The bot can be configured by adding a `.mention-bot` file to the base directory of the repo. Here's a list of the possible options:

```js
{
  ""maxReviewers"": 5, // Maximum  number of people to ping in the PR message, default is 3
  ""numFilesToCheck"": 10, // Number of files to check against, default is 5
  ""message"": ""@pullRequester, thanks! @reviewers, please review this."",
             // custom message using @pullRequester and @reviewers
  ""alwaysNotifyForPaths"": [
    {
      ""name"": ""ghuser"", // The user's Github username
      ""files"": [""src/js/**/*.js""], // The array of file globs associated with the user
      ""skipTeamPrs"": false // mention-bot will exclude the creator's own team from mentions
    }
  ], // Users will always be mentioned based on file glob
  ""fallbackNotifyForPaths"": [
    {
      ""name"": ""ghuser"", // The user's Github username
      ""files"": [""src/js/**/*.js""], // The array of file globs associated with the user
      ""skipTeamPrs"": false // mention-bot will exclude the creator's own team from mentions
    }
  ], // Users will be mentioned based on file glob if no other user was found
  ""findPotentialReviewers"": true, // mention-bot will try to find potential reviewers based on files history, if disabled, `alwaysNotifyForPaths` is used instead
  ""fileBlacklist"": [""*.md""], // mention-bot will ignore any files that match these file globs
  ""userBlacklist"": [], // Users in this list will never be mentioned by mention-bot
  ""userBlacklistForPR"": [], // PR made by users in this list will be ignored
  ""requiredOrgs"": [], // mention-bot will only mention user who are a member of one of these organizations
  ""actions"": [""opened""], // List of PR actions that mention-bot will listen to, default is ""opened""
  ""branches"": [],  // List of branches that mention-bot will listen to, default is all branches
  ""skipAlreadyAssignedPR"": false, // mention-bot will ignore already assigned PR's
  ""skipAlreadyMentionedPR"": false, // mention-bot will ignore if there is already existing an exact mention
  ""assignToReviewer"": false, // mention-bot assigns the most appropriate reviewer for PR
  ""createReviewRequest"": false, // mention-bot creates review request for the most appropriate reviewer for PR
  ""createComment"": true, // mention-bot creates a comment mentioning the reviewers for the PR
  ""skipTitle"": """", // mention-bot will ignore PR that includes this text in the title,
  ""withLabel"": """", // mention-bot will only consider PR's with this label. Must set actions to [""labeled""].
  ""delayed"": false, // mention-bot will wait to comment until specified time in `delayedUntil` value
  ""delayedUntil"": ""3d"", // Used if delayed is equal true, permitted values are: minutes, hours, or days, e.g.: '3 days', '40 minutes', '1 hour', '3d', '1h', '10m'
  ""skipCollaboratorPR"": false // mention-bot will ignore if PR is made by collaborator
}
```

The glob matching is an extended form of glob syntax performed by [`minimatch`](https://github.com/isaacs/minimatch), with the default options; read [the `minimatch` README](https://github.com/isaacs/minimatch/blob/master/README.md) for more details.

**Note:** The `.mention-bot` file must be valid JSON.

The default config can be overridden via environment config. e.g.:

```zsh
MENTION_BOT_CONFIG={""maxReviewers"":1,""delayed"":true}
```
---

## How Does It Work?

Every time there's a new pull request, GitHub wakes up the mention bot <img src=""https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/15710697?v=3&s=40"" width=""20"" height=""20"" /> using Webhooks.

Once awakened, the bot will download the diff of the pull request and figure out which files and lines have been touched.

<img width=""1139"" src=""https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/197597/11022818/92edd20e-861d-11e5-8c44-c64c1a7de79f.png"">

For these, it will download the associated blame to figure out who last touched that line, as they may be a good reviewer.

<img width=""923"" src=""https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/197597/11022820/973166aa-861d-11e5-83b1-b05e8228f974.png"">

After running the [algorithm](#algorithm) described in the next section, it will comment on the pull request notifying those people and go back to sleep.

<img width=""769"" src=""https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/197597/11022875/3e4949de-861f-11e5-8459-573a8dbc9013.png"">

## Algorithm

The problem of finding who the best reviewers are is really hard and I don't think that any algorithm will achieve perfection. Instead, what we want here is to be **best effort**. We want to notify people that are likely going to be interested and be good reviewers. If we ping a few too many people that's not the end of the world neither if we don't ping the exact right person.

We use two heuristics:
- If a line was deleted or modified, the person that last touched that line is likely going to care about this pull request.
- If a person last touched many lines in the file where the change was made, they will want to be notified.

**Initialization**

Create two empty hash map:
- `DeletedLines` for authors of deleted lines.
- `AllLines` for authors of lines in the changed files.

**Filling the data structures**

- for each deleted line, find the author in the blame and increase its count by one in the `DeletedLines` map.
- for each line in every file that was changed, find the author in the blame and increase its count by one in the `AllLines` map.

Since getting the blame information is sending an http request to GitHub it is pretty expensive. We first sort the files by number of deleted lines and only pick the top 5. Since we're only looking for 3 names and the algorithm is best effort, this greatly speeds up the algorithm in case of large pull requests for little loss in precision.

**Putting it all together**

- delete from `AllLines` all the names that appear in both maps. We don't want to mention the same person twice.
- sort each map by count
- concat `DeletedLines` with `AllLines`
- take the first three names

## How To Contribute or Run Your Own Bot?

If you want to use a different account for the bot, change the message or extend it with more functionalities, we've tried to make it super easy:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/facebook/mention-bot.git
cd mention-bot
npm install
npm start
# Follow the instructions there
```

Alternatively, click the button below:

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy)

If you would like the mention-bot to function on private repositories, set the `GITHUB_USER` and `GITHUB_PASSWORD` environment variables. You must disable two-factor authentication or you will receive a console log like this: `Login to ${USERNAME} failed`.

You can also set a `REQUIRED_ORG` environment variable, so you don't have to configure it in each repository of your organization.

You can also build deploy it as a Docker image:

```bash
docker build -t mention-bot .
docker run -e GITHUB_USER=""a"" -p 5000:5000  mention-bot
```

**Build & run the bot locally with docker-compose**

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your bot's information. Build and run
the bot:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

The bot will be available at http://localhost.

## Configuring a custom message

If you want to change the default message, you can write your custom logic in [message.js](https://github.com/facebook/mention-bot/blob/master/message.js), or add 'message' in the [.mention-bot configuration](#configuration) file.

## How to run the bot on GitHub Enterprise

If you want to run the bot on your GitHub Enterprise instance, add the GHE host and path prefix to the config section of package.json

```json
""config"": {
  ""gheHost"": ""github.my-GHE-enabled-company.com"",
  ""ghePathPrefix"": ""/api/v3""
}
```

If you use `http` protocol, the config section like this:

```json
""config"": {
  ""gheHost"": ""github.my-GHE-enabled-company.com"",
  ""ghePathPrefix"": ""/api/v3"",
  ""gheProtocol"": ""http"",
  ""ghePort"": 80
}
```


## Programmatic API

When you require `mention-bot` you will get all the functions exposed by [`mention-bot.js`](https://github.com/facebook/mention-bot/blob/master/mention-bot.js) module. You are expected to manage your own server and also connection to the github repository.

```
npm install mention-bot github
```

API can be used like this:

```js
var mentionBot = require('mention-bot');
var GitHubApi = require('github');

var github = new GitHubApi({ version: '3.0.0' });
github.authenticate({
  type: 'oauth',
  token: '...token...'
});

mentionBot
  .guessOwnersForPullRequest(
    'https://github.com/fbsamples/bot-testing', // repo
    65, // pull request number
    'mention-bot', // user that created the pull request
    'master', // branch
    { maxReviewers: 3 }, // config
    github
  )
  .then(function(users) {
    // array with user names which should be included in review
    console.log(users);
  })
  .catch(function(err) {
    console.error(err);
  });
```

## Installation
This library depends on the `appcompat-v7`, `design`, and `gridlayout-v7` support libraries.
It is recommended that you exclude them from the library and add those dependencies on your own.
This will ensure both your project and this library are using the same versions of the support
libraries.

```groovy
dependencies {
    // Recommended
    compile('com.philliphsu:bottomsheetpickers:2.4.1') {
        exclude group: 'com.android.support', module: 'appcompat-v7'
        exclude group: 'com.android.support', module: 'design'
        exclude group: 'com.android.support', module: 'gridlayout-v7'
    }
    compile 'com.android.support:appcompat-v7:[LATEST_VERSION]'
    compile 'com.android.support:design:[LATEST_VERSION]'
    compile 'com.android.support:gridlayout-v7:[LATEST_VERSION]'

    // Standard -- not recommended!
    compile 'com.philliphsu:bottomsheetpickers:2.4.1'
}
```

## Usage
You must be using a `android.support.v4.app.FragmentActivity` or `android.support.v4.app.Fragment`.
The pickers are indirect subclasses of `android.support.v4.app.DialogFragment`.

### Implement Callbacks

To retrieve the date or time set in the pickers, implement an appropriate callback interface.

* `com.philliphsu.bottomsheetpickers.date.DatePickerDialog.OnDateSetListener`
* `BottomSheetTimePickerDialog.OnTimeSetListener`

```java
@Override
public void onDateSet(DatePickerDialog dialog, int year, int monthOfYear, int dayOfMonth) {
    Calendar cal = new java.util.GregorianCalendar();
    cal.set(Calendar.YEAR, year);
    cal.set(Calendar.MONTH, monthOfYear);
    cal.set(Calendar.DAY_OF_MONTH, dayOfMonth);
    mText.setText(""Date set: "" + DateFormat.getDateFormat(this).format(cal.getTime()));
}

@Override
public void onTimeSet(ViewGroup viewGroup, int hourOfDay, int minute) {
    Calendar cal = new java.util.GregorianCalendar();
    cal.set(Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY, hourOfDay);
    cal.set(Calendar.MINUTE, minute);
    mText.setText(""Time set: "" + DateFormat.getTimeFormat(this).format(cal.getTime()));
}
```

### Create Pickers

```java
Calendar now = Calendar.getInstance();
// As of version 2.3.0, `BottomSheetDatePickerDialog` is deprecated.
DatePickerDialog date = DatePickerDialog.newInstance(
    MainActivity.this,
    now.get(Calendar.YEAR),
    now.get(Calendar.MONTH),
    now.get(Calendar.DAY_OF_MONTH));

// Configured according to the system preference for 24-hour time.
NumberPadTimePickerDialog pad = NumberPadTimePickerDialog.newInstance(MainActivity.this);
// Alternatively, you can set 24-hour mode on your own.
boolean is24HourMode = ...
NumberPadTimePickerDialog pad = NumberPadTimePickerDialog.newInstance(MainActivity.this, is24HourMode);

GridTimePickerDialog grid = GridTimePickerDialog.newInstance(
    MainActivity.this,
    now.get(Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY),
    now.get(Calendar.MINUTE),
    DateFormat.is24HourFormat(MainActivity.this));
```

As of version 2.3.0, you have the option to create pickers using the `Builder` pattern.
This is helpful if you want to chain together [additional options](#additional-options)
before creating the dialog. Of course, you can continue creating a dialog with
`newInstance()` as usual, and then just call setters on the dialog itself.

```java
DatePickerDialog date = new DatePickerDialog.Builder(
    MainActivity.this,
    now.get(Calendar.YEAR),
    now.get(Calendar.MONTH),
    now.get(Calendar.DAY_OF_MONTH))
    /* ... Set additional options ... */
    .build();

// Configured according to the system preference for 24-hour time.
NumberPadTimePickerDialog pad = new NumberPadTimePickerDialog.Builder(MainActivity.this)
    /* ... Set additional options ... */
    .build();
// Alternatively, you can set 24-hour mode on your own.
NumberPadTimePickerDialog pad = new NumberPadTimePickerDialog.Builder(MainActivity.this, is24HourMode)
    /* ... Set additional options ... */
    .build();

GridTimePickerDialog grid = new GridTimePickerDialog.Builder(
    MainActivity.this,
    now.get(Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY),
    now.get(Calendar.MINUTE),
    DateFormat.is24HourFormat(MainActivity.this))
    /* ... Set additional options ... */
    .build();
```

### Show the Dialog

Pass in a `android.support.v4.app.FragmentManager` to the dialog's `show()`.

```java
// For a `android.support.v4.app.FragmentActivity`:
dialog.show(getSupportFragmentManager(), TAG);

// For a `android.support.v4.app.Fragment`:
dialog.show(getFragmentManager(), TAG);
```

### Theming
The pickers automatically use your current theme's `colorAccent` defined in your `styles.xml`.

You can specify whether to use a light (default) or dark theme:
* in `styles.xml` by specifying a boolean value for the attribute `themeDark` in your theme.
```xml
<item name=""themeDark"">true</item>
```
* in code with the dialog's `setThemeDark(boolean dark)` method. This overwrites the value specified in XML.

### Additional Options
These additional APIs can be used to customize the appearance of the picker. They are
available both as setter methods and as `Builder` options, unless otherwise noted.

#### Basic Options
These APIs are available in all pickers.

* `setThemeDark(boolean dark)`
Set a dark or light theme.

* `setAccentColor(@ColorInt int color)`
Set the accent color. This color is primarily used to tint views in the picker.
If this picker is using the light theme and you did not call `setHeaderColor(int)`,
this color will also be applied to the dialog's header.

* `setBackgroundColor(@ColorInt int color)`
Set the background color. If this color is dark, consider setting the theme dark to ensure text
in the picker has enough contrast.

* `setHeaderColor(@ColorInt int color)`
Set the header color. If this color is light, consider setting the header text dark to ensure
it has enough contrast.

* `setHeaderTextDark(boolean dark)`
Set the header text to use a light or dark color. The default is false, so a light color is applied.

#### `DatePickerDialog` and `DatePickerDialog.Builder`

* `setFirstDayOfWeek(int startOfWeek)`
Use this to set the day (`Calendar.SUNDAY` through `Calendar.SATURDAY`) that a week should start on.

* `setYearRange(int startYear, int endYear)`
Sets the range of years to be displayed by this date picker. If a minimal date and/or maximal date
were set using `setMinDate(Calendar)` or `setMaxDate(Calendar)`, dates in the specified range of
years that lie outside of the minimal and maximal dates will be disallowed from being selected.
_This does NOT change the minimal date's year or the maximal date's year._

* `setMinDate(Calendar calendar)`
Sets the minimal date that can be selected in this date picker. Dates before (but not including)
the specified date will be disallowed from being selected.

* `setMaxDate(Calendar calendar)`
Sets the maximal date that can be selected in this date picker. Dates after (but not including)
the specified date will be disallowed from being selected.

* `setHeaderTextColorSelected(@ColorInt int color)`
Set the color of the header text when it is selected.

* `setHeaderTextColorUnselected(@ColorInt int color)`
Set the color of the header text when it is not selected.

* `setDayOfWeekHeaderTextColorSelected(@ColorInt int color)`
Set the color of the day-of-week header text when it is selected.

* `setDayOfWeekHeaderTextColorUnselected(@ColorInt int color)`
Set the color of the day-of-week header text when it is not selected.

#### `NumberPadTimePickerDialog` and `NumberPadTimePickerDialog.Builder`

* `setHeaderTextColor(@ColorInt int color)`
Set the color of the header text that stores the inputted time.

#### `GridTimePickerDialog` and `GridTimePickerDialog.Builder`

* `setHeaderTextColorSelected(@ColorInt int color)`
Set the color of the header text when it is selected.

* `setHeaderTextColorUnselected(@ColorInt int color)`
Set the color of the header text when it is not selected.

* `setTimeSeparatorColor(@ColorInt int color)`
Set the color of the time separator that separates the hour and minute views in the header.

* `setAmPmTextColorSelected(@ColorInt int color)`
Set the color of the AM/PM text when it is selected. This is equivalent to
`setHalfDayButtonColorSelected(int)` in 24-hour time.

* `setAmPmTextColorUnselected(@ColorInt int color)`
Set the color of the AM/PM text when it is not selected. This is equivalent to
`setHalfDayButtonColorUnselected(int)` in 24-hour time.

* `setHalfDayButtonColorSelected(@ColorInt int color)`
Set the color of the half-day image button when it is selected. This is equivalent to
`setAmPmTextColorSelected(int)` in 12-hour time.

* `setHalfDayButtonColorUnselected(@ColorInt int color)`
Set the color of the half-day image button when it is not selected. This is equivalent to
`setAmPmTextColorUnselected(int)` in 12-hour time.

#### Setters Only
These are only available as setter methods in `NumberPadTimePickerDialog`.

* `setHint(String hint)` or `setHint(@StringRes int resid)`
Sets the hint of the input time TextView.

* `setInputTextSize(int textSize)`
Sets the text size in px of the input time TextView.

* `getInputTextView()`
Returns the `TextView` that stores the inputted time.

[![Build Status](https://github.com/dice-discord/bot/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/dice-discord/bot/actions)
[![XO code style](https://img.shields.io/badge/code_style-XO-5ed9c7.svg)](https://github.com/xojs/xo)
[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/dice-discord/bot/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/dice-discord/bot)

A total rewrite of the [Dice Discord bot](https://github.com/dice-discord/bot) in TypeScript using the [Akairo framework](https://discord-akairo.github.io/#/).

## Developers

### File naming scheme

#### Commands

Commands should be under their category's subfolder (ex. `commands/admin` for the `admin` category).

Command filenames should exactly match their ID.

#### Listeners

Commands should be under their category's subfolder (ex. `listeners/client` for the `client` category).
The category should exactly match their emitter name.

Listener filenames should exactly match their event name (ex. `commandStarted.ts` for the `commandStarted` event).

#### Inhibitors

Inhibitor filenames should exactly match their ID.

### Prequisites

This project uses [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) 12 to run.

This project uses [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) to install dependencies, although you can use another package manager like [npm](https://www.npmjs.com) or [pnpm](https://pnpm.js.org).

```sh
yarn install
# or `npm install`
# or `pnpm install`
```

### Building

Run the `build` script to compile the TypeScript into the `tsc_output` folder.
This will compile the `src` and the `test` directory, so be careful not to upload the whole folder as a published package.

### Style

This project uses [Prettier](https://prettier.io) and [XO](https://github.com/xojs/xo).

You can run Prettier in the project with this command:

```sh
yarn run style
```

You can run XO with this command:

```sh
yarn run lint
```

Note that XO will also error if you have TypeScript errors, not just if your formatting is incorrect.

### Linting

This project uses [XO](https://github.com/xojs/xo) (which uses [ESLint](https://eslint.org) and some plugins internally) to perform static analysis on the TypeScript.
It reports things like unused variables or not following code conventions.

```sh
yarn run lint
```

Note that XO will also error if you have incorrect formatting, not just if your TypeScript code has errors.

[![Go Reference](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/github.com/go-telegram-bot-api/telegram-bot-api/v5.svg)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/go-telegram-bot-api/telegram-bot-api/v5)
[![Test](https://github.com/go-telegram-bot-api/telegram-bot-api/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/go-telegram-bot-api/telegram-bot-api/actions/workflows/test.yml)

All methods are fairly self-explanatory, and reading the [godoc](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/go-telegram-bot-api/telegram-bot-api/v5) page should
explain everything. If something isn't clear, open an issue or submit
a pull request.

There are more tutorials and high-level information on the website, [go-telegram-bot-api.dev](https://go-telegram-bot-api.dev).

The scope of this project is just to provide a wrapper around the API
without any additional features. There are other projects for creating
something with plugins and command handlers without having to design
all that yourself.

Join [the development group](https://telegram.me/go_telegram_bot_api) if
you want to ask questions or discuss development.

## Example

First, ensure the library is installed and up to date by running
`go get -u github.com/go-telegram-bot-api/telegram-bot-api/v5`.

This is a very simple bot that just displays any gotten updates,
then replies it to that chat.

```go
package main

import (
	""log""

	tgbotapi ""github.com/go-telegram-bot-api/telegram-bot-api/v5""
)

func main() {
	bot, err := tgbotapi.NewBotAPI(""MyAwesomeBotToken"")
	if err != nil {
		log.Panic(err)
	}

	bot.Debug = true

	log.Printf(""Authorized on account %s"", bot.Self.UserName)

	u := tgbotapi.NewUpdate(0)
	u.Timeout = 60

	updates := bot.GetUpdatesChan(u)

	for update := range updates {
		if update.Message != nil { // If we got a message
			log.Printf(""[%s] %s"", update.Message.From.UserName, update.Message.Text)

			msg := tgbotapi.NewMessage(update.Message.Chat.ID, update.Message.Text)
			msg.ReplyToMessageID = update.Message.MessageID

			bot.Send(msg)
		}
	}
}
```

If you need to use webhooks (if you wish to run on Google App Engine),
you may use a slightly different method.

```go
package main

import (
	""log""
	""net/http""

	""github.com/go-telegram-bot-api/telegram-bot-api/v5""
)

func main() {
	bot, err := tgbotapi.NewBotAPI(""MyAwesomeBotToken"")
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}

	bot.Debug = true

	log.Printf(""Authorized on account %s"", bot.Self.UserName)

	wh, _ := tgbotapi.NewWebhookWithCert(""https://www.example.com:8443/""+bot.Token, ""cert.pem"")

	_, err = bot.Request(wh)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}

	info, err := bot.GetWebhookInfo()
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}

	if info.LastErrorDate != 0 {
		log.Printf(""Telegram callback failed: %s"", info.LastErrorMessage)
	}

	updates := bot.ListenForWebhook(""/"" + bot.Token)
	go http.ListenAndServeTLS(""0.0.0.0:8443"", ""cert.pem"", ""key.pem"", nil)

	for update := range updates {
		log.Printf(""%+v\n"", update)
	}
}
```

If you need, you may generate a self-signed certificate, as this requires
HTTPS / TLS. The above example tells Telegram that this is your
certificate and that it should be trusted, even though it is not
properly signed.

    openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -days 3560 -subj ""//O=Org\CN=Test"" -nodes

Now that [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org) is available,
you may wish to generate your free TLS certificate there.

                )
            ]
        )
    )

TemplateSendMessage - ImageCarouselTemplate
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code:: python

    image_carousel_template_message = TemplateSendMessage(
        alt_text='ImageCarousel template',
        template=ImageCarouselTemplate(
            columns=[
                ImageCarouselColumn(
                    image_url='https://example.com/item1.jpg',
                    action=PostbackAction(
                        label='postback1',
                        display_text='postback text1',
                        data='action=buy&itemid=1'
                    )
                ),
                ImageCarouselColumn(
                    image_url='https://example.com/item2.jpg',
                    action=PostbackAction(
                        label='postback2',
                        display_text='postback text2',
                        data='action=buy&itemid=2'
                    )
                )
            ]
        )
    )

FlexSendMessage
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code:: python

    flex_message = FlexSendMessage(
        alt_text='hello',
        contents=BubbleContainer(
            direction='ltr',
            hero=ImageComponent(
                url='https://example.com/cafe.jpg',
                size='full',
                aspect_ratio='20:13',
                aspect_mode='cover',
                action=URIAction(uri='http://example.com', label='label')
            )
        )
    )

※ You can pass a **dict** to FlexSendMessage#contents as follows:

.. code:: python

    flex_message = FlexSendMessage(
        alt_text='hello',
        contents={
            'type': 'bubble',
            'direction': 'ltr',
            'hero': {
                'type': 'image',
                'url': 'https://example.com/cafe.jpg',
                'size': 'full',
                'aspectRatio': '20:13',
                'aspectMode': 'cover',
                'action': { 'type': 'uri', 'uri': 'http://example.com', 'label': 'label' }
            }
        }
    )

Thus, You can send a JSON designed with `Flex Message Simulator <https://developers.line.biz/console/fx/>`__.

With QuickReply
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code:: python

    text_message = TextSendMessage(text='Hello, world',
                                   quick_reply=QuickReply(items=[
                                       QuickReplyButton(action=MessageAction(label=""label"", text=""text""))
                                   ]))

Webhook
-------

WebhookParser
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

※ You can use WebhookParser

\_\_init\_\_(self, channel\_secret)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code:: python

    parser = linebot.WebhookParser('YOUR_CHANNEL_SECRET')

parse(self, body, signature, as_payload=False)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Parses the webhook body, and returns a list of Event objects or a WebhookPayload object (depending on as_payload).
If the signature does NOT match, ``InvalidSignatureError`` is raised.

.. code:: python

    events = parser.parse(body, signature)

    for event in events:
        do_something(event)

.. code:: python

    payload = parser.parse(body, signature, as_payload=True)

    for event in payload.events:
        do_something(payload.event, payload.destination)

WebhookHandler
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

※ You can use WebhookHandler

\_\_init\_\_(self, channel\_secret)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code:: python

    handler = linebot.WebhookHandler('YOUR_CHANNEL_SECRET')

handle(self, body, signature)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Handles webhooks with **handlers** added
by the decorators `add <#add-self-event-message-none>`__ and `default <#default-self>`__.
If the signature does NOT match, ``InvalidSignatureError`` is raised.

.. code:: python

    handler.handle(body, signature)

add(self, event, message=None)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Add a **handler** method by using this decorator.

.. code:: python

    @handler.add(MessageEvent, message=TextMessage)
    def handle_message(event):
        line_bot_api.reply_message(
            event.reply_token,
            TextSendMessage(text=event.message.text))

When the event is an instance of MessageEvent and event.message is an instance of TextMessage,
this handler method is called.

.. code:: python

    @handler.add(MessageEvent)
    def handle_message(event, destination):
        # do something

If the arity of the handler method is more than one,
a destination property in a webhook request is passed to it as the second argument.

.. code:: python

    @handler.add(FollowEvent)
    def handle_follow():
        # do something

If the arity of the handler method is zero, the handler method is called with no arguments.

default(self)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Set the default **handler** method by using this decorator.

.. code:: python

    @handler.default()
    def default(event):
        print(event)

If there is no handler for an event, this default handler method is called.

# Tested on Ubuntu 14.04, for other OSs check out https://github.com/yagop/telegram-bot/wiki/Installation
sudo apt-get install libreadline-dev libconfig-dev libssl-dev lua5.2 liblua5.2-dev libevent-dev make unzip git redis-server g++ libjansson-dev libpython-dev expat libexpat1-dev
```

```bash
# After those dependencies, lets install the bot
cd $HOME
git clone https://github.com/yagop/telegram-bot.git
cd telegram-bot
./launch.sh install
./launch.sh # Will ask you for a phone number & confirmation code.
```

Enable more [`plugins`](https://github.com/yagop/telegram-bot/tree/master/plugins)
-------------
See the plugins list with `!plugins` command.

Enable a disabled plugin by `!plugins enable [name]`.

Disable an enabled plugin by `!plugins disable [name]`.

Those commands require a privileged user, privileged users are defined inside `data/config.lua` (generated by the bot), stop the bot and edit if necessary.


Run it as a daemon
------------
If your Linux/Unix comes with [upstart](http://upstart.ubuntu.com/) you can run the bot by this way
```bash
$ sed -i ""s/yourusername/$(whoami)/g"" etc/telegram.conf
$ sed -i ""s_telegrambotpath_$(pwd)_g"" etc/telegram.conf
$ sudo cp etc/telegram.conf /etc/init/
$ sudo start telegram # To start it
$ sudo stop telegram # To stop it
```

## How to include
Add the repository to your project **build.gradle**:

```Gradle
repositories {
    maven {
        url ""https://jitpack.io""
    }
}
```

And add the library to your module **build.gradle**:

```Gradle
dependencies {
    compile 'com.github.javiersantos:BottomDialogs:1.2.1'
}
```

## Usage
### Basic Bottom Dialog
A basic bottom dialog will be shown. You have access to methods such as `setTitle()`, `setContent()`, `setIcon()`, `setCancelable()`, `dismiss()`, etc. Customizations are explained below.

```Java
new BottomDialog.Builder(this)
	.setTitle(""Awesome!"")
	.setContent(""What can we improve? Your feedback is always welcome."")
	.show();
```

or

```Java
BottomDialog bottomDialog = new BottomDialog.Builder(this)
	.setTitle(""Awesome!"")
	.setContent(""What can we improve? Your feedback is always welcome."")
	.build();
...
bottomDialog.show();
```

### Displaying an icon
The bottom dialog icon will be shown to the left of the title.

```Java
new BottomDialog.Builder(this)
	.setTitle(""Awesome!"")
	.setContent(""What can we improve? Your feedback is always welcome."")
	.setIcon(R.drawable.ic_launcher)
	//.setIcon(ContextCompat.getDrawable(this, R.drawable.ic_launcher))
	.show();
```

### Adding buttons and callbacks
Buttons are showed at the end of the bottom dialog. You can add your own text, colors and actions/callbacks.

```Java
new BottomDialog.Builder(this)
	.setTitle(""Awesome!"")
	.setContent(""What can we improve? Your feedback is always welcome."")
	.setPositiveText(""OK"")
	.setPositiveBackgroundColorResource(R.color.colorPrimary)
	//.setPositiveBackgroundColor(ContextCompat.getColor(this, R.color.colorPrimary)
	.setPositiveTextColorResource(android.R.color.white)
	//.setPositiveTextColor(ContextCompat.getColor(this, android.R.color.colorPrimary)
	.onPositive(new BottomDialog.ButtonCallback() {
		@Override
		public void onClick(BottomDialog dialog) {
			Log.d(""BottomDialogs"", ""Do something!"");
		}
	}).show();
```

```Java
new BottomDialog.Builder(this)
	.setTitle(""Awesome!"")
	.setContent(""What can we improve? Your feedback is always welcome."")
	.setNegativeText(""Exit"")
	.setNegativeTextColorResource(R.color.colorAccent)
	//.setNegativeTextColor(ContextCompat.getColor(this, R.color.colorAccent)
	.onNegative(new BottomDialog.ButtonCallback() {
		@Override
		public void onClick(BottomDialog dialog) {
			Log.d(""BottomDialogs"", ""Do something!"");
		}
	}).show();
```

If no `onPositive()` or `onNegative()` callbacks are provided, then the bottom dialog will be dismissed when tapping de button.

If `autoDismiss()` is turned `false`, then you must manually dismiss the dialog in these callbacks. Auto dismiss is `true` by default.

### Dismissing when touching outside
The `setCancelable()` method lets you disable dismissing the bottom dialog when you tap outside the dialog window.

```Java
new BottomDialog.Builder(this)
	.setTitle(""Awesome!"")
	.setContent(""What can we improve? Your feedback is always welcome."")
	.setCancelable(false)
	.show();
```

### Adding a custom view
You can add custom view to your bottom dialog just by adding the layout to the `setCustomView()` method.

```Java
new BottomDialog.Builder(this)
	.setTitle(""Awesome!"")
	.setContent(""What can we improve? Your feedback is always welcome."")
	.setCustomView(R.layout.my_custom_view)
	.show();
```

A detailed description is available at: https://github.com/javiersantos/BottomDialogs/wiki/Adding-a-custom-view

### Adding a custom color and font

You can add custom colors and fonts to bottom dialog by using the view objects: `getIconImageView()`, `getTitleTextView()`, `getContentTextView()`, `getNegativeButton()` and `getPositiveButton()`. For example:

```Java
BottomDialog bottomDialog = BottomDialog.Builder(this)
	...
	.build();

bottomDialog.getTitleTextView().setTextColor(Color.parseColor(""#8f000000""));
bottomDialog.getTitleTextView().setTypeface(BaseActivity.getFont(Fonts.SEMI_BOLD));
bottomDialog.show();
```

## Third Party Bindings

### React Native

118,118,joeldg/bowhead,PHP,"UPDATE (4/6/2018) see follow-up: https://medium.com/@joeldg/cryptocurrency-bot-framework-followup-3bc289322fb1

UPDATE (3/15/2018) I'm still here, left my old job, started a new job and been hectic. Work will resume on Bowhead this weekend.

UPDATE (2/8/2018): **COMMANDS ARE PROBABLY BROKE** updated project to Laravel 5.6 and made changes to coinigy data getter.

UPDATE (1/30/2018): **COMMANDS ARE PROBABLY BROKE**, I am still cleaning up from the Bitfinex issues. To summarize, Bitfinex no longer allows accounts from the United States, earlier version of Bowhead was very tied to Bitfinex for data. The recent work is adding Coinigy and CCXT support so Bowhead will work for more than 90 exchanges. I have a full time job a one-year old son, so I have limited time and do as much as I can, so I apologize that it is still being fixed.

CURRENT BOWHEAD ROADMAP:
1. (currently **20%**) Finish the web main page (initial, graphs, signals and indcators)
2. Finish the strategy builder page (+ backtesting, strategy stats, stub out sections for future ML articles)
3. Finish Strategy class.
   * Add social strategy page, upload your own strategies for the community, download strategies to work with and backtest.
4. Import all current Bowhead strategies into the new Strategy builder.
   * Add strategy builder hooks to web main page
5. Finish the web interface arb page (arbitrage matrix)
   * Add strategy builder hooks to arb page
6. Finish the settings page with auto-update options, paper/live trading options, alerts and so on.
7. Create docs section with links.
8. Create stats and reports page (show trades, +/-, exchange fees breakdown, arb breakdown and strategy comparisons)
    --THEN--
9. Revisit each command and fix.
10. Revisit all three Bowhead articles and rewrite new versions.
11. Create cloud-based Bowhead data service, so that Bowhead can get historical and realtime data from ALL exchanges with no API keys. Only provide API keys for those you wish to trade on.
    * Update Bowhead to use data service
12. Create YouTube video series on Bowhead, strategies etc.
13. Get some sleep

Then, hopefully we can start the ML series for Bowhead.

UPDATE (1/26/2018): Vastly cleaned up the web configuration and verified it works with Postgres, and Timescale hypertables (http://timescale.com).

UPDATE (1/08/2018): PREVIEW of the official Docker container, with partial web configuration. Container is using Alpine Linux+Nginx+PHP7.1 with MariaDB and Redis. ... Still a work in progress, but, it will connect to coinigy -or- your ccxt accounts and pull ticker data into the database on the pairs you select in the web interface.

```
docker pull joeldg/bowhead

docker run -d -p 8080:8080 joeldg/bowhead

open http://localhost:8080/setup
```
Then you will need to wait, it takes a while for it to fire up because of the composer update it needs to do.
When it comes up, it will be on port http://{IP}:8080/setup

# bowhead
[![Gitter](https://badges.gitter.im/ccxt-dev/ccxt.svg)](https://gitter.im/bowhead-bot/Lobby)

a REST-API and console-based cryptocurrency trading bot boilerplate and framework
Written by Joel De Gan, 2017


Bowhead (a type of whale) is the codename for a boilerplate within Laravel for building 
Cryptocurrency and Forex automated systems.

Utilizing a RESTful API, Bowhead can be used as a middle-layer for your favorite language
to interface with multiple brokerages and market makers, just add your API keys.

Bowhead utilizes all the TALib functions implemented in the Trader extenstion for PHP
and creates some of it's own indicators which are composites of those from TALib.

#### Focus of the project.
The primary focus is to have an easy to use boilerplate/framework that you can 
rapidly create a fully functional trading system on various strategies on 
BTC funded trading platforms that typically do not require that you are ""verified""
this way you can trade with funds without funneling them through your bank and
having to deal with some potential tax issues (depending on the country you live in)

#### Companion article
This project has a companion article which walks you through how to set it up and walks you through 
setting up your first strategy and running it on [Whaleclub](https://whaleclub.co/join/tn6uE) 
and on [1Broker](https://1broker.com/?r=21434), which you will need accounts on both. 
Additionally the following are recommended exchnges:
* [Binance](https://www.binance.com/?ref=12325729)
* [Coinbase/GDAX](https://www.coinbase.com/join/51950ca286c21b84dd000021)
* [Kraken](https://www.kraken.com)
* [CEX](https://cex.io/r/0/joeldg/0/)

Usage of [Coinigy](https://www.coinigy.com/?r=32d4c701)(free 1-month trial) also is being added.
 
The companion article is on Medum and is:

Part 1: [Let’s write a cryptocurrency bot (part 1).](https://medium.com/@joeldg/an-advanced-tutorial-a-new-crypto-currency-trading-bot-boilerplate-framework-e777733607ae)

Part 2: [Let’s write a cryptocurrency bot (part 2)](https://medium.com/@joeldg/lets-write-a-cryptocurrency-bot-part-2-7adf47f5a80e)

Part 3: [Let’s write a cryptocurrency bot (part 3)](https://medium.com/@joeldg/lets-write-a-cryptocurrency-bot-part-3-826d65e55184)

I highly suggest you read through it and follow along to get it up and running.

#### basic setup
You will need 
* PHP7.1
* Redis
* MySql 
* the PHP Pecl Trader extension, 

for Python
you will need the dotenv package. 
````
pip install python-env
````

#### Notes
This project was initially done in the Laravel-Lumen (lightweight) framework 
however the move to a fully open sourced boilerplate/framework I felt that having the 
full ability of Laravel could be important, particularly Jobs and other parts which
utilize queues could be invaluable.

Bowhead was written and tested on a Mac and I have it running in the cloud on an
Ubuntu linux server in AWS making real money trades every day on the Crypto
markets, on Forex pairs and on binary options.

One limitation that may mess up this running on Windows is the usage of a
named pipe for passing data between Python and PHP in real time, there are
ways around this, such as using Redis, or piping the output to a parser. 

I am open to suggestions for how to get it to work on Windows
 
#### A note about editors. 
> I would like to additionally say that when you are working with Laravel, it
 it is almost mandatory to use an editor like PHPStorm, you 'can' use something like
 Atom but it would be like trying to use notepad to work on a dotNet project,
 you can technically 'do it' but it will be frustrating and you will not have
 a good time.  I cannot recommend PHPStorm more highly. They have a free trial
 and with updates it extends the trial period, even still, if you choose to purchase
 it, it's not expensive.
 
#### additional libraries
 I have added a couple utility libs that I like to use with this.
 
 - Console class, this is for colorizing, doing progress bars and doing text tables in console which look like the following.
````
 ╔═══════════════════════════════════════════════╗
 ║ BTC    │                                      ║
 ║ LTC    │                                      ║
 ╚════════╧══════════════════════════════════════╝
````

If you feel in a tipping mood send BTC to
````
14d9xxG1h5DkaDihiDBwzp5nj82dTcWfHc
````

DONE:
1) Write my own Coinbase, Whaleclub, 1Broker wrappers.
2) Create Indicators wrapper for TALib.
3) Create Candles wrapper for TALib
4) Collect console functions into one Console class.
5) Streaming data from Oanda
6) Streaming data from Bitfinex
7) Dockerfile easy-setup done and tested.
8) Signals module
9) Strategies module
10) REST mapping module

IN PROGRESS:
1) REST-API 
2) Write my own Oanda, Bitfinex and Poloniex API wrappers.

TODO:
1) Standardize the calls to brokerages so the method names are the same across all of them.
2) reporting, logging and backtesting tools.

wechatBot 是基于 node 与 [wechaty](https://github.com/Chatie/wechaty) 的微信小情话工具。最初功能只有每日发送天气和一句情话，后来添加了智能机器人聊天功能。但由于本项目面向小白用户与刚接触 node 开发的用户，故拆分了两个项目，一个是功能专一面向小白的 [《微信每日说》](https://github.com/gengchen528/wechatBot) （也就是本项目） ，另一个也在我的仓库下 [《智能微秘书》](https://github.com/gengchen528/wechat-assistant-pro) 面向有较多编程经验的用户。下面主要介绍微信每日说的使用

## ~~最新通知 喜大普奔~~

~~由于wechaty的升级，现已支持所有微信登录，就算你的微信之前不能登录web版，现在也可以用了，赶快来体验吧。~~

### 遗憾的通知

由于UOS桌面版协议微信已经关闭了，没法再继续用桌面版协议登录了，现在只能换回web协议了。可以登录网页版微信的账号可以继续用，不能登录网页版协议的就不能用了。或者你可以申请Wechaty 的ipad local协议的token可以免费试用7天 。申请地址:  https://github.com/padlocal/wechaty-puppet-padlocal

### 主要功能

- [x] 定时给女朋友发送每日天气提醒，以及每日一句
- [x] 天行机器人自动陪女朋友聊天（需要自己申请[天行机器人](https://www.tianapi.com/signup.html?source=474284281)api，不过目前开源的机器人 api 都不要抱太大希望，因为很傻的，如果你有发现好的机器人可以来推荐）
- [x] 垃圾分类功能，使用方法：？垃圾名称
- [x] 想要更多群管理，自动加好友功能，群定时任务，好友定时任务，并体验在线配置服务，请移步[《智能微秘书》](https://github.com/gengchen528/wechat-assistant-pro)

### 可选聊天机器人

- 天行机器人: 默认设置为天行机器人(智能化程度一般)，还是建议大家自行注册自己账号 [天行数据官网](https://www.tianapi.com/signup.html?source=474284281)
- 图灵机器人: 目前比较智能的机器人，但是需要注册后进行身份认证，才可调用，且每天只可免费调用 100 次（收费标准 99 元/月，每天 1000 次）[图灵官网](http://www.tuling123.com)

## 天行数据需要申请的api （重要）

如遇到获取不到天气数据，或者机器人无法自动回复等问题，请登录天行数据个人中心查看是否申请了对应的接口权限，以下链接为快速申请链接：

* 天行机器人： [https://www.tianapi.com/apiview/47](https://www.tianapi.com/apiview/47)
* 天气查询：[https://www.tianapi.com/apiview/72](https://www.tianapi.com/apiview/72)
* 垃圾分类： [https://www.tianapi.com/apiview/97](https://www.tianapi.com/apiview/97)
* 土味情话： [https://www.tianapi.com/apiview/80](https://www.tianapi.com/apiview/80)
* 天行图灵机器人: [https://www.tianapi.com/apiview/98](https://www.tianapi.com/apiview/98)

## 环境

- `node.js` ( 12 ≤ version ≤ 14, 推荐使用 **V14**)
- `Mac / Linux / Windows`

## docker 部署

### 直接拉取镜像（推荐）

由于自己构建部分依赖安装比较慢，或者经常会卡住，所以本项目已经提前构建好发布到dockerhub了，直接pull就行了

#### step1： 拉取镜像

```shell

docker pull aibotk/wechat-bot

```

#### step2： 配置`config/index.js`

目录`config/index.js`中的内容按照说明配置，请注意阅读说明

#### step3： 启动docker

以下两个命令自己选择一个执行就行，执行的时候会下载puppet，可能会比较慢，耐心等待一下即可

1、请在项目根目录执行，这个命令是前台执行可以直接看到log日志的，但是没法关闭，只能销毁终端实例

```shell

docker run -e TZ=""Asia/Shanghai"" --name=chatBot --volume=""$(pwd)/config/"":/bot/config aibotk/wechat-bot

```

2、这个命令可以在后台运行，多了一个`-d`

```shell

docker run -e TZ=""Asia/Shanghai"" -d --name=chatBot --volume=""$(pwd)/config/"":/bot/config aibotk/wechat-bot

```

[如何查看docker日志](https://www.cnblogs.com/mydesky2012/p/11430394.html)

### 自行构建docker镜像 （不建议）

需要提前安装 docker 环境，并且配置好`config/index.js`中的内容

```shell script
docker build -t wechat-bot .
docker run wechat-bot
```

## 安装配置

视频教程： <a href=""https://www.bilibili.com/video/av56077628?pop_share=1"" target=""_blank"">《三步教你用 Node 做一个微信哄女友神器》</a>

### 下载安装 node

访问 node 官网：[http://nodejs.cn/download/](http://nodejs.cn/download/)，下载系统对应版本的 node 安装包，并执行安装。

> 1. windows 下安装步骤详细参考 [NodeJs 安装 Windwos 篇](https://www.cnblogs.com/liuqiyun/p/8133904.html)
> 2. Mac 下安装详细步骤参考 [NodeJs 安装 Mac 篇](https://blog.csdn.net/qq_32407233/article/details/83758899)
> 3. Linux 下安装详细步骤参考 [NodeJs 安装 Linux 篇](https://www.cnblogs.com/liuqi/p/6483317.html)

### 配置 npm 源

配置 `npm` 源为淘宝源（重要，因为需要安装 `chromium`，不配置的话下载会失败或者速度很慢，因为这个玩意 140M 左右）

```bash
npm config set registry https://registry.npm.taobao.org
npm config set disturl https://npm.taobao.org/dist
npm config set puppeteer_download_host https://npm.taobao.org/mirrors
```

### 下载代码

![download-project](https://user-gold-cdn.xitu.io/2019/6/16/16b5fcb3ea7ee507?w=1917&h=937&f=png&s=180655)

```bash
# 如果没有安装 git，也可直接下载项目zip包
git clone https://github.com/gengchen528/wechatBot.git
cd wechatBot
npm install
```

### 项目配置

所有配置项均在 `config/index.js` 文件中

```javascript
  // 配置文件
  module.exports = {
      // 每日说配置项（必填项）
      NAME: 'leo助手', //女朋友备注姓名
      NICKNAME: 'leo助手', //女朋友昵称
      MEMORIAL_DAY: '2015/04/18', //你和女朋友的纪念日
      CITY: '上海', //女朋友所在城市（城市名称，不要带“市”）
      SENDDATE: '0 6 8 * * *', //定时发送时间 每天8点06分0秒发送，规则见 /schedule/index.js
      TXAPIKEY: '', //此处须填写个人申请的天行apikey,请替换成自己的（自行申请天行天气和土味情话的接口） 申请地址https://www.tianapi.com/signup.html?source=474284281

      //高级功能配置项（非必填项）
      AUTOREPLY: true, //自动聊天功能 默认开启, 关闭设置为 false
      DEFAULTBOT: '0', //设置默认聊天机器人 0 天行机器人 1 图灵机器人 2 天行对接的图灵机器人，需要到天行机器人官网充值（50元/年，每天1000次）
      AUTOREPLYPERSON: ['好友1备注','好友2备注'], //指定多个好友开启机器人聊天功能   指定好友的备注，最好不要带有特殊字符
      TULINGKEY: '图灵机器人apikey',//图灵机器人apikey,需要自己到图灵机器人官网申请，并且需要认证

  }
```

### 执行

当以上步骤都完成后，在命令行界面输入 `node index.js`，第一次执行会下载 puppeteer，所以会比较慢，稍等一下，出现二维码后即可拿出微信扫描

## 常见问题处理 (FAQ)

问题解决基本方案:

- 先检查 node 版本是否大于 12, 且不能超过 14
- 确认 npm 或 yarn 已经配置好淘宝源
- 存在 package-lock.json 文件先删除
- 删除`node_modules`后重新执行`npm install` 或`cnpm install`
- 使用最新版[《智能微秘书》](https://github.com/gengchen528/wechat-assistant-pro)，摆脱环境问题

1. 我的微信号无法登陆
    
    最新版代码已经解决不能登录的问题，放心拉最新代码使用就行了

    ~~从 2017 年 6 月下旬开始，使用基于 web 版微信接入方案存在大概率的被限制登陆的可能性。 主要表现为：无法登陆 Web 微信，但不影响手机等其他平台。 验证是否被限制登陆： https://wx.qq.com 上扫码查看是否能登陆。 更多内容详见：~~

5. 支持 红包、转账、朋友圈… 吗 ?

    支付相关 - 红包、转账、收款 等都不支持

6. 更多关于 wechaty 功能相关接口

    [参考 wechaty 官网文档](https://wechaty.js.org/docs/)
    
7. 希望输出运行日志相关 DEBUG 信息, 并保存到本地
   - 在运行前, 系统里输入 `export WECHATY_LOG=verbose` 就能将默认日志输出改为详细 (其他等级参考[官方文档](https://www.npmjs.com/package/brolog#loglevelnewlevel)) 
   - 保存到本地, 在支持 `bash` 环境的命令行中, 可以用这样的方式启动程序: `node index.js 2>&1 | tee bot.log`, 这样控制台和后台会同时显示/存储日志信息.

8 .CentOS 安装 better-sqlite3 报错的问题

* 首先执行 `sudo yum install centos-release-scl-rh`，`sudo yum install devtoolset-8-build `这两个方法

* 安装相应的gdb，`sudo yum install devtoolset-8-gdb`
  
* 同样，也可以安装相应版本的 gcc 和 g++，`sudo yum install devtoolset-8-gcc devtoolset-8-gcc-c++`

* yum安装完后，原来的gcc不覆盖，所以需要执行enable脚本更新环境变量，`sudo source /opt/rh/devtoolset-8/enable`

* 可以通过加入到profile里面开机自动`source, vim /etc/profile`, 跳到最后一行加入以下内容，`source /opt/rh/devtoolset-8/enable`

参考文章 [better-sqlite3](https://www.cnblogs.com/clwsec/p/12493653.html)

124,124,jw84/messenger-bot-tutorial,JavaScript,"# 🤖 Creating your own Facebook Messenger bot

![Alt text](/demo/Demo.gif)

Facebook recently opened up their Messenger platform to enable bots to converse with users through Facebook Apps and on Facebook Pages. 

You can read the  [documentation](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/quickstart) the Messenger team prepared but it's not very clear for beginners and intermediate hackers. 

So instead here is how to create your own messenger bot in 15 minutes.

## 🙌 Get set

Messenger bots uses a web server to process messages it receives or to figure out what messages to send. You also need to have the bot be authenticated to speak with the web server and the bot approved by Facebook to speak with the public.

You can also skip the whole thing by git cloning this repository, running npm install, and run a server somewhere.

### *Build the server*

1. Install the Heroku toolbelt from here https://toolbelt.heroku.com to launch, stop and monitor instances. Sign up for free at https://www.heroku.com if you don't have an account yet.

2. Install Node from here https://nodejs.org, this will be the server environment. Then open up Terminal or Command Line Prompt and make sure you've got the very most recent version of npm by installing it again:

    ```
    sudo npm install npm -g
    ```

3. Create a new folder somewhere and let's create a new Node project. Hit Enter to accept the defaults.

    ```
    npm init
    ```

4. Install the additional Node dependencies. Express is for the server, request is for sending out messages and body-parser is to process messages.

    ```
    npm install express request body-parser --save
    ```

5. Create an index.js file in the folder and copy this into it. We will start by authenticating the bot.

    ```javascript
    'use strict'
    
    const express = require('express')
    const bodyParser = require('body-parser')
    const request = require('request')
    const app = express()

    app.set('port', (process.env.PORT || 5000))

    // Process application/x-www-form-urlencoded
    app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({extended: false}))

    // Process application/json
    app.use(bodyParser.json())

    // Index route
    app.get('/', function (req, res) {
    	res.send('Hello world, I am a chat bot')
    })

    // for Facebook verification
    app.get('/webhook/', function (req, res) {
    	if (req.query['hub.verify_token'] === 'my_voice_is_my_password_verify_me') {
    		res.send(req.query['hub.challenge'])
    	}
    	res.send('Error, wrong token')
    })

    // Spin up the server
    app.listen(app.get('port'), function() {
    	console.log('running on port', app.get('port'))
    })
    ```

6. Make a file called Procfile and copy this. This is so Heroku can know what file to run.

    ```
    web: node index.js
    ```

7. Commit all the code with Git then create a new Heroku instance and push the code to the cloud.

    ```
    git init
    git add .
    git commit --message ""hello world""
    heroku create
    git push heroku master
    ```

### *Setup the Facebook App*

1. Create or configure a Facebook App or Page here https://developers.facebook.com/apps/

    ![Alt text](/demo/shot1.jpg)

2. In the app go to Messenger tab then click Setup Webhook. Here you will put in the URL of your Heroku server and a token. Make sure to check all the subscription fields. 

    ![Alt text](/demo/shot3.jpg)

3. Get a Page Access Token and save this somewhere. 

    ![Alt text](/demo/shot2.jpg)

4. Go back to Terminal and type in this command to trigger the Facebook app to send messages. Remember to use the token you requested earlier.

    ```bash
    curl -X POST ""https://graph.facebook.com/v2.6/me/subscribed_apps?access_token=<PAGE_ACCESS_TOKEN>""
    ```

### *Setup the bot*

Now that Facebook and Heroku can talk to each other we can code out the bot.

1. Add an API endpoint to index.js to process messages. Remember to also include the token we got earlier. 

    ```javascript
    app.post('/webhook/', function (req, res) {
	    let messaging_events = req.body.entry[0].messaging
	    for (let i = 0; i < messaging_events.length; i++) {
		    let event = req.body.entry[0].messaging[i]
		    let sender = event.sender.id
		    if (event.message && event.message.text) {
			    let text = event.message.text
			    sendTextMessage(sender, ""Text received, echo: "" + text.substring(0, 200))
		    }
	    }
	    res.sendStatus(200)
    })

    const token = ""<PAGE_ACCESS_TOKEN>""
    ```
    
    **Optional, but recommended**: keep your app secrets out of version control!
    - On Heroku, its easy to create dynamic runtime variables (known as [config vars](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/config-vars)). This can be done in the Heroku dashboard UI for your app **or** from the command line:
    ![Alt text](/demo/config_vars.jpg)
    ```bash
    heroku config:set FB_PAGE_ACCESS_TOKEN=fake-access-token-dhsa09uji4mlkasdfsd
    
    # view
    heroku config
    ```

    - For local development: create an [environmental variable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_variable) in your current session or add to your shell config file.
    ```bash
    # create env variable for current shell session
    export FB_PAGE_ACCESS_TOKEN=fake-access-token-dhsa09uji4mlkasdfsd
    
    # alternatively, you can add this line to your shell config
    # export FB_PAGE_ACCESS_TOKEN=fake-access-token-dhsa09uji4mlkasdfsd
    
    echo $FB_PAGE_ACCESS_TOKEN
    ```
    
    - `config var` access at runtime
    ``` javascript
    const token = process.env.FB_PAGE_ACCESS_TOKEN
    ```
    
    
3. Add a function to echo back messages

    ```javascript
    function sendTextMessage(sender, text) {
	    let messageData = { text:text }
	    request({
		    url: 'https://graph.facebook.com/v2.6/me/messages',
		    qs: {access_token:token},
		    method: 'POST',
    		json: {
			    recipient: {id:sender},
    			message: messageData,
    		}
    	}, function(error, response, body) {
    		if (error) {
			    console.log('Error sending messages: ', error)
    		} else if (response.body.error) {
			    console.log('Error: ', response.body.error)
		    }
	    })
    }
    ```

4. Commit the code again and push to Heroku

    ```
    git add .
    git commit -m 'updated the bot to speak'
    git push heroku master
    ```
    
5. Go to the Facebook Page and click on Message to start chatting!

![Alt text](/demo/shot4.jpg)

## ⚙ Customize what the bot says

### *Send a Structured Message*

Facebook Messenger can send messages structured as cards or buttons. 

![Alt text](/demo/shot5.jpg)

1. Copy the code below to index.js to send a test message back as two cards.

    ```javascript
    function sendGenericMessage(sender) {
	    let messageData = {
		    ""attachment"": {
			    ""type"": ""template"",
			    ""payload"": {
    				""template_type"": ""generic"",
				    ""elements"": [{
    					""title"": ""First card"",
					    ""subtitle"": ""Element #1 of an hscroll"",
					    ""image_url"": ""http://messengerdemo.parseapp.com/img/rift.png"",
					    ""buttons"": [{
						    ""type"": ""web_url"",
						    ""url"": ""https://www.messenger.com"",
						    ""title"": ""web url""
					    }, {
						    ""type"": ""postback"",
						    ""title"": ""Postback"",
						    ""payload"": ""Payload for first element in a generic bubble"",
					    }],
				    }, {
					    ""title"": ""Second card"",
					    ""subtitle"": ""Element #2 of an hscroll"",
					    ""image_url"": ""http://messengerdemo.parseapp.com/img/gearvr.png"",
					    ""buttons"": [{
						    ""type"": ""postback"",
						    ""title"": ""Postback"",
						    ""payload"": ""Payload for second element in a generic bubble"",
					    }],
				    }]
			    }
		    }
	    }
	    request({
		    url: 'https://graph.facebook.com/v2.6/me/messages',
		    qs: {access_token:token},
		    method: 'POST',
		    json: {
			    recipient: {id:sender},
			    message: messageData,
		    }
	    }, function(error, response, body) {
		    if (error) {
			    console.log('Error sending messages: ', error)
		    } else if (response.body.error) {
			    console.log('Error: ', response.body.error)
		    }
	    })
    }
    ```

2. Update the webhook API to look for special messages to trigger the cards

    ```javascript
    app.post('/webhook/', function (req, res) {
	    let messaging_events = req.body.entry[0].messaging
	    for (let i = 0; i < messaging_events.length; i++) {
		    let event = req.body.entry[0].messaging[i]
		    let sender = event.sender.id
		    if (event.message && event.message.text) {
			    let text = event.message.text
			    if (text === 'Generic') {
				    sendGenericMessage(sender)
			    	continue
			    }
			    sendTextMessage(sender, ""Text received, echo: "" + text.substring(0, 200))
		    }
	    }
	    res.sendStatus(200)
    })
    ```

### *Act on what the user messages*

What happens when the user clicks on a message button or card though? Let's update the webhook API one more time to send back a postback function.

```javascript  
  app.post('/webhook/', function (req, res) {
    let messaging_events = req.body.entry[0].messaging
    for (let i = 0; i < messaging_events.length; i++) {
      let event = req.body.entry[0].messaging[i]
      let sender = event.sender.id
      if (event.message && event.message.text) {
  	    let text = event.message.text
  	    if (text === 'Generic') {
  		    sendGenericMessage(sender)
  		    continue
  	    }
  	    sendTextMessage(sender, ""Text received, echo: "" + text.substring(0, 200))
      }
      if (event.postback) {
  	    let text = JSON.stringify(event.postback)
  	    sendTextMessage(sender, ""Postback received: ""+text.substring(0, 200), token)
  	    continue
      }
    }
    res.sendStatus(200)
  })
```

Git add, commit, and push to Heroku again.

Now when you chat with the bot and type 'Generic' you can see this.

BotKube integration with [Slack](https://slack.com), [Mattermost](https://mattermost.com) or [Microsoft Teams](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/microsoft-teams/group-chat-software) helps you monitor your Kubernetes cluster, debug critical deployments and gives recommendations for standard practices by running checks on the Kubernetes resources.
You can also ask BotKube to execute kubectl commands on k8s cluster which helps debugging an application or cluster.

![](botkube-title.jpg)

## Getting started
Please follow [this](https://www.botkube.io/installation/) for a complete BotKube installation guide.

## Architecture
![](/botkube_arch.jpg)
- **Informer Controller:** Registers informers to kube-apiserver to watch events on the configured k8s resources. It forwards the incoming k8s event to the Event Manager.
- **Event Manager:** Extracts required fields from k8s event object and creates a new BotKube event struct. It passes BotKube event struct to the Filter Engine.
- **Filter Engine:** Takes the k8s object and BotKube event struct and runs Filters on them. Each filter runs some validations on the k8s object and modifies the messages in the BotKube event struct if required.
- **Event Notifier:** Finally, notifier sends BotKube event over the configured communication channel.
- **Bot Interface:** Bot interface takes care of authenticating and managing connections with communication mediums like Slack, Mattermost, Microsoft Teams and reads/sends messages from/to them. 
- **Executor:** Executes BotKube or kubectl command and sends back the result to the Bot interface.

    }

    @EventMapping
    public void handleDefaultMessageEvent(Event event) {
        System.out.println(""event: "" + event);
    }
}
```

## How do I use a proxy server?

You can use `LineMessagingServiceBuilder` to configure a proxy server. It accepts your own OkHttpBuilder instance.

Note: You don't need to use an add-on like Fixie to have static IP addresses for proxy servers. You can make API calls without entering IP addresses on the server IP whitelist.

    [-] API_ID:   You can get this value from https://my.telegram.org
    [-] API_HASH :   You can get this value from https://my.telegram.org
    [-] STRINGSESSION : Your String Session, You can get this From Repl or BY running String_Gen File Locally
    [-] MONGO_DB : Your Mongo DB DataBase Url. 
    [-] LOG_GRP: Your Log Group/Channel Chat ID. This is Very Important and Some Modules Will Not Work Well Without This!
[+] The fridayUserbot will not work without setting the mandatory vars.
```

Basit Hatalar ve Çözümleri!
=================
1 • Eğer hatanız;
`Cannot find module 'blabla'`
şeklindeyse modül kurmanız gerekmektedir.
Modül kurmak için konsolu açıp `npm i blabla` yazınız.
Glitch kullanıyorsanız basit kurulum yolu;
1 • Package.json'a girin.
2 • Yukarıdan Add Package basın.
3 • İnmesi gereken paket ismini yazın ve çıkana basın.
başarılı! 

2 • Eğer hatanız;
`ayarlar is not defined:`
şeklindeyse hatayı aldığınız komutun en üstüne alttaki kodu girmeniz gerekli:
`const ayarlar = require('../ayarlar.json')`
 yazın, sorun çözülecektir.
 

 3 • Eğer hatanız;
`SyntaxError: Unexpected token };`
Tarzında bir hata alıyorsanız, açıp kapatmadığınız veya kapatıp açmadığın bir paranteziniz vardır demek. Çözmek için hata oluşmadan önce en son eklediğiniz komuta bi' göz gezdirmek. Sorunu bulduğunuz zaman parantezleri düzelttiğinizde sorunda ortadan kalkar.
 
4 • Eğer hatanız; 
`(node:6660) UnhandlePromiseRejectionWarning: Error: Incorrect login details were provided.`
Tarzında ki bir token hatasında yapmanız gereken tek şey, https://discord.com/developers/applications sayfasına girip botunuza giriş yapmak, tokeninizi oradan kopyalayıp projenizde ki token gerektiren yere doğru bir şekilde """" içinde yapıştırın.
 
5 • Eğer hatanız; 
`fields.flat is not a function`
İse Node versiyonunuzu 12x yapın.
 
6 • Eğer Hatanız;
`(node:223) UnhandledPromiseRejectionWarning: TypeError: Cannot read property 'id' of null`
Şeklindeyse `if (!message.guild) return;` Komutun Başına Yazarak Çözebilirsiniz

7 • Eğer Hatanız;
`TypeError: Cannot read property 'send' of undefined`
Şeklindeyse Bot mesajı atacak bir kanalı bulamayınca yukarıda ki hatayı verir. Log kısmına bakıp hangi komutta hangi kanalın ayarlı olmadığını kontrol edin.

8 • Eğer Hatanız;
`maxListeners`
 Hatanız da yukarıda ki gibi maxListeners geçiyor ise main dosyanızın bir bölümüne `client.setMaxListeners(30)` yazın. Sorun çözülecektir, çözülmez ise fazla client.on eventlerini silin.
 
9 • Eğer Hatanız;
`DeprecationWarning:TextChannel#sendEmbed: use TextChannel#send instead`
Bu uyarıyı verdiği zaman `<channel>.sendEmbed` eventini `<channel>.send` yapmanız gerekir

10 • Eğer Böyle Bir Yazı Alıyorsanız;
`DeprecationWarning: Collection#find: pass a function instead`
Bu bir hata değil uyarıdır yapmanız gereken;
`<collection>.find('name', 'isim')`
Kodlarını
`<collection>.find(x => x.name == 'name')`
Şeklinde kullanırsanız sorun düzelecektir (Örnektir.)

 11 • Eğer Hatanız;
`UnhandledPromiseRejectionWarning: DiscordAPIError: Missing Permissions`
Bu şekilde bir hata alıyorsanız bota uygulatmaya çalıştırdığınız işleme botun yetkisi yetmiyordur vereceğim kodu main dosyanıza atarak sorunu çözebilirsiniz.
 
 12 • Eğer Hatanız;
`Something took to long to do` 
Bu hatanın nedeni: Bir gün içerisinde 1000 defa botunuz tokene bağlantı kurduğu halinde veya Glitch, Heroku vb. sitelerde kullanıyorsanız bazenleri bu sitelerde 'tokeni kötüye kullanan' IP Ban yiyor ve çoğu proje remixleseniz dahi token ban yiyor. 
Çözümü: 1-2 gün civarı bu böyle devam edebilir. İP Ban yemiş projeyi bulmanız gerek bu projeyi bulduğunuzda remixleyin hatanız düzelir.
 

`İyi Kullanımlar!`

<h2 name=""quick-start"" align=""center"">Quick Start</h2>

Botfront only requires a recent version of Docker. You can install the CLI with the following:

```bash
npm install -g botfront
```

Then just run `botfront`to get started.

<!-- broken image. commented out as I'm not sure it should be deleted -->
<!-- <img src=""/botfront/docs/terminalizer/botfront-setup.gif?raw=true"" width=""100%""> -->

<br/>
<h2 name=""documentation"" align=""center"">Documentation</h2>

The [official documentation](https://botfront.io/docs/getting-started/setup) of Botfront is hosted on [botfront.io](https://botfront.io/docs/getting-started/setup). It is automatically built and updated on every new release. Once you've installed the cli you can also use `botfront docs` to open it.

**We welcome contributions!** It can be as easy as clicking on the ""Edit page on Github"" link at the bottom of every documentation pages.

<h2 name=""development"" align=""center"">Development</h2>

### Installation

1. Botfront is a Meteor app, so the first step is to [install Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/install)
2. Then clone this repo and install the dependencies:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/botfront/botfront
cd botfront/botfront
meteor npm install
```
3. Install the CLI from the source code:
```bash
# if you installed Botfront from npm uninstall it.
npm uninstall -g botfront
# Install the cli from the source code
cd cli && npm link
```
Botfront needs to be connected to other services, especially Rasa. To do this, you need to create a regular project, and start Botfront with a dedicated configuration:

1. Create a Botfront project with `botfront init` (somewhere else, not in the repo)
2. Start your project with `botfront up -e botfront`. This will run all services except the Botfront app, since you are going to run it with Meteor locally
3. Go back to the botfront checkout `cd botfront/botfront` and run Botfront with `meteor npm run start:docker-compose.dev`. Botfront will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) so open your browser and happy editing :smile_cat:

### TroubleShooting

Some [botfront cli](https://github.com/botfront/botfront/blob/master/cli/src/cli.js) commands that may help if you run into problems:

```shell
botfront init     # create a new botfront project
botfront logs     # show the logs!
botfront killall  # stop all docker services
botfront down     # stop all botfront services
botfront up       # restart botfront
botfront docs     # open the docs in your browser
```

Note that these should be run from the same directory as your botfront project

### Contribute

We ❤️ contributions of all size and sorts. If you find a typo, if you want to improve a section of the documentation or if you want to help with a bug or a feature, here are the steps:

1. Fork the repo and create a new branch, say `fix-botfront-typo-1`
2. Fix/improve the codebase
3. Commit the changes. **Commit message must follow [the naming convention](#commit-messages-naming-convention)**, say `fix(conversation builder): display story groups in alphabetical order`
4. Make a pull request. **Pull request name must follow [the naming convention](#commit-messages-naming-convention)**. It can simply be one of your commit messages, just copy paste it, e.g. `fix(readme): improve the readability and move sections`
5. Submit your pull request and wait for all checks passed (up to an hour)
6. Request reviews from one of the developers from our core team.
7. Get a 👍 and PR gets merged.

Well done! Once a PR gets merged, here are the things happened next:
- all Docker images tagged with `branch-master` will be automatically updated in an hour. You may check the status on the [Actions](https://github.com/botfront/botfront/actions) tab.
- your contribution and commits will be included in [our release note](https://github.com/botfront/botfront/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

### Testing

End to end tests are using the Cypress testing framework.

To manually run the Cypress tests, you need to have Botfront running in development mode. Some tests also require Rasa to be available.

Once you are at the root of the repo, you can enter the following.

```bash
cd botfront
# if you want to open Cypress' graphical interface
npx cypress open
# If you want to run the whole suite in headless mode
# This could take up to an hour depending on your computer
npx cypress run
# If you want to run a specific test
npx cypress run --spec ""cypress/integration/02_training/training.spec.js""
```

### Commit messages naming convention

To help everyone with understanding the commit history of Botfront, we employ [`commitlint`](https://commitlint.js.org/#/) to enforce the commit styles:

```text
type(scope?): subject
```

where `type` is one of the following:

- build
- ci
- chore
- docs
- feat
- fix
- perf
- refactor
- revert
- style
- test

`scope` is optional, represents the module your commit working on.

`subject` explains the commit.

As an example, a commit that improved the documentation:
```text
docs(conversation builder): update slots manager screenshot.
```

### [What's new with Bot Framework](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/what-is-new?view=azure-bot-service-4.0)

This repository contains code for the .NET version of the [Microsoft Bot Framework SDK](https://github.com/Microsoft/botframework-sdk), which is part of the Microsoft Bot Framework - a comprehensive framework for building enterprise-grade conversational AI experiences. 

This SDK enables developers to model conversation and build sophisticated bot applications using .NET. SDKs for [JavaScript](https://github.com/Microsoft/botbuilder-js), [Python](https://github.com/Microsoft/botbuilder-python) and [Java (preview)](https://github.com/Microsoft/botbuilder-java) are also available.

To get started building bots using the SDK, see the [Azure Bot Service Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/?view=azure-bot-service-4.0).

## Daily Feeds
The daily feeds are published to Azure Artifacts and MyGet. 
- The Azure Artifacts daily feed is our preferred method to obtain the most recent Bot Framework NuGet packages. To use the daily builds published to Azure Artifacts, use: 
`https://pkgs.dev.azure.com/ConversationalAI/BotFramework/_packaging/SDK/nuget/v3/index.json`

- For detailed instructions to consume the daily builds in Azure Artifacts [visit this page](dailyBuilds.md).
- To use the daily builds published to MyGet, please follow the instructions [here](UsingMyGet.md). **NOTE**: The MyGet feed will be depecrated soon. Please use the Azure Artifacts daily feed instead.

## Dependency Graph
To view our libraries' interdependencies, you can refer to the [dependency graph](https://botbuildersdkblobstorag2.blob.core.windows.net/sdk-dotnet-dependency-reports/latest/InterdependencyGraph.html) for our libraries.

## Getting Started
To get started building bots using the SDK, see the [Azure Bot Service Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/?view=azure-bot-service-4.0).

The [Bot Framework Samples](https://github.com/microsoft/botbuilder-samples) includes a rich set of samples repository.

If you want to debug an issue, would like to [contribute](#contributing), or understand how the Bot Builder SDK works, instructions for building and testing the SDK are below.

### Prerequisites
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) 
- [Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com/)

### Clone
Clone a copy of the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/botbuilder-dotnet.git
```

Change to the SDK's directory:

```bash
cd botbuilder-dotnet
```

### Build and test locally
Open `Microsoft.Bot.Builder.sln` in Visual Studio. 
On the menu bar, choose **Build** > **Build Solution**.

When the solution is built, local NuGet package files (.nupkg) are generated for each project and are available under the `outputPackages` directory.  You can add this folder to your NuGet Package Manager source list in Visual Studio (choose **Tools > NuGet Package Manager > Package Manager Settings** from the Visual Studio menu and add an additional **Package Sources** from there), allowing you to consume these in your local projects.

## Getting support and providing feedback
Below are the various channels that are available to you for obtaining support and providing feedback. Please pay carful attention to which channel should be used for which type of content. e.g. general ""how do I..."" questions should be asked on Stack Overflow, Twitter or Gitter, with GitHub issues being for feature requests and bug reports.

134,134,hangoutsbot/hangoutsbot,Python,"# Introduction

Hangupsbot is a chat bot designed for working with Google Hangouts.

Please see:
* [Instructions for installing](https://github.com/hangoutsbot/hangoutsbot/blob/master/INSTALL.md)
* [Issue tracker](https://github.com/hangoutsbot/hangoutsbot/issues) for bugs, issues and feature requests
* [Wiki](https://github.com/hangoutsbot/hangoutsbot/wiki) for everything else


## Repository Links
* [GitHub Organisation](https://github.com/hangoutsbot)
* [Translation Project](https://github.com/hangoutsbot/hangoutsbot-locales)
* [Reference Hangups Library](https://github.com/hangoutsbot/hangups)


## Features
* **Mentions** :
  If somebody mentions you in a room, receive a private hangout from the bot with details on the mention,
  including context, room and person who mentioned you.
* **Syncouts** :
  A syncout is two Hangout group chats that have their messages forwarded to each other, allowing seamless
  interaction between the two rooms. Primarily used to beat the 150-member chat limit, but it can also be
  used for temporarily connecting teams together to interact.
* **Cross-chat Syncouts** :
  Half of your team is on Slack? No problem! You can connect them into the same room to communicate.
  Support for other chat clients coming soon.
* **[Hubot Integration](https://github.com/hangoutsbot/hangoutsbot/wiki/Hubot-Integration)**:
  Hangupsbot allows you to connect to [Hubot](https://hubot.github.com/), instantly providing you access
  to hundreds of developed chat tools and plugins.
* **Plugins and sinks** :
  The bot has [instructions for developing your own plugins and sinks](https://github.com/hangoutsbot/hangoutsbot/wiki/Authoring-Bot-Extensions), allowing the bot to interact
  with external services such as your company website, Google scripts and much more.
* **Plugin mania** :
  games, nickname support, subscribed keywords, customizable API - **[the list goes on](https://github.com/hangoutsbot/hangoutsbot/wiki/Plugin-List)**!

# Running The Bot

Note: **First run?** See the [installation instructions](https://github.com/hangoutsbot/hangoutsbot/blob/master/INSTALL.md)

To execute: `python3 hangupsbot.py`

```
usage: hangupsbot [-h] [-d] [--log LOG] [--cookies COOKIES] [--memory MEMORY] [--config CONFIG] [--version]

optional arguments:
-h, --help         show this help message and exit
-d, --debug        log detailed debugging messages (default: False)
--log LOG          log file path (default:
                   ~/.local/share/hangupsbot/hangupsbot.log)
--cookies COOKIES  cookie storage path (default:
                   ~/.local/share/hangupsbot/cookies.json)
--memory MEMORY    memory storage path (default:
                   ~/.local/share/hangupsbot/memory.json)
--config CONFIG    config storage path (default:
                   ~/.local/share/hangupsbot/config.json)
--version          show program's version number and exit
```

# Bot Configuration for Administrators

Configuration directives can be specified in `config.json`.

Please note that the `config.json` file supplied with the repository is not 
  supposed to be edited/changed. It is the reference file used by the bot to 
  create the actual configuration file located elsewhere in the system. To find out 
  where the actual file is, please see the [**Additional Configuration** section](https://github.com/hangoutsbot/hangoutsbot/blob/master/INSTALL.md#additional-configuration)
  in the [installation](https://github.com/hangoutsbot/hangoutsbot/blob/master/INSTALL.md)
  instructions.

Most configuration directives are specified **globally**
* Global directives are always specified in the ""root"" of `config.json`.
* To specify a per-conversation directive, the same configuration option should
  be defined as `config.conversations[<conversation-id>].<configuration option>`.
* Per-conversation directives override global settings, if both are set.
* Manually-configured per-conversation directives are DEPRECATED.

## Plugins

The `plugins` key in `config.json` allows you to optionally specify a list of plugins
  that will be loaded by the bot on startup. If this option is left as `null`, then
  all available plugins will be loaded.

To specify the plugins to be loaded, first ensure that the correct `.py` files are
  inside your `hangupsbot/plugin/` directory, then modify the `plugins` key in
  `config.json` to reflect which plugins/files you want to load e.g.
    `plugins: [""mentions"", ""default"", ""chance"", ""syncrooms""]`

Some plugins may require extra configuration.
  `config.json` is the the configuration provider for the bot and its plugins.

Some interesting plugins:
* [mentions plugin](https://github.com/hangoutsbot/hangoutsbot/wiki/Mentions-Plugin)
  * alert users when their names are mentioned in a chat
* [subscribe plugin](https://github.com/hangoutsbot/hangoutsbot/wiki/Subscribe-Plugin)
  * alert users when keywords they are subscribed to are said in a chat
* [syncout / syncrooms plugins](https://github.com/hangoutsbot/hangoutsbot/wiki/Syncouts-Plugin)
  * relay chat messages between different hangout group conversations (syncrooms)
  * configure via bot commands (syncrooms_config)
  * automated translation via Google Translate of relayed messages (syncrooms_autotranslate)

The wiki has a more comprehensive **[list of plugins](https://github.com/hangoutsbot/hangoutsbot/wiki/Plugin-List)**...

# Interacting with the Bot

There are two general types of interactions with the bot:
* **`/bot` commands** begin with `/bot` e.g. `/bot dosomething`
  * some bot commands are admin-only
* custom interactions (usage and accessibility varies by plugin)

The base bot supports some basic command even without any plugins loaded.
  Here is a partial list:

`/bot help`
* Bot lists all supported commands in a private message with the user

`/bot ping`
* Bot replies with a `pong`.

`/bot version`
* Bot replies with the version number of the framework

A full list of commands supported by the base framework is available at the 
  [**Core Commands**](https://github.com/hangoutsbot/hangoutsbot/wiki/Core-Commands)
  wiki page.

The wiki also has a 
  [**list of plugins**](https://github.com/hangoutsbot/hangoutsbot/wiki/Plugin-List)
  detailing available plugins with commands lists and usage.

# Updating

* Navigate to the bot directory (eg. `cd ~/hangupsbot`)
* Change to the latest stable branch using `git checkout master`
* `git pull` to pull the latest version of hangupsbot
* `pip3 install -r requirements.txt --upgrade`
* Restart the bot

# Debugging

* Run the bot with the `-d` parameter e.g. `python3 hangupsbot.py -d` - this
  lowers the log level to `INFO` for a more verbose and informative log file.
* `tail` the log file, which is probably located at
  `/<user>/.local/share/hangupsbot/hangupsbot.log` - the location varies by
  distro!
* Console output (STDOUT) is fairly limited whatever the log level, so rely
  on the output of the log file instead.

## Tips for troubleshooting
**Program isn't running:**
* Update `hangupsbot` and `hangups`
* Run `hangups` to check if the original hangups library is working
  * If there are errors, delete the cookie at ``~/.local/share/hangupsbot/cookies.json` and try again
  * Log into your Google Account from the server's address.

**Bot isn't responding to messages:**
* Check that the chats are not going into the 'Invites' section of Hangouts.

136,136,botgram/shell-bot,JavaScript,"# shell-bot

This is a fully functional shellrunner [Telegram bot][]. You tell it a
command, it executes it and posts the live output. You can send input to the
command by replying to the output messages.

It's a fairly complex example, because it actually appears to the
command as a terminal, interprets escape sequences and **it will
update messages if their lines get touched**. This means interactive
programs such as wget should work naturally, you should see the
status bar update.

The bot also allows files to be uploaded or downloaded, and also
has a simple text editor available for convenience.

Here's an example of the bot running `git` to clone a repository:

![Basic tasks](http://i.imgur.com/Xxtoe4G.png)

Here's an example of the bot running alsamixer:

![Alsamixer with keypad](http://i.imgur.com/j8aXFLd.png)

This bot demonstrates a great part of [Botgram][]'s API.

**Note:** Due to the tight integration, running this bot on Windows is
currently *not* supported.

## Install

First install [node-pty dependencies](https://github.com/Microsoft/node-pty#dependencies). For example, if you're in Ubuntu/Debian:

~~~
sudo apt install -y make python build-essential
~~~

If you're using fedora instead:
```
sudo dnf install -y python
sudo dnf group install -y ""C Development Tools and Libraries"" 
```

Before using this, you should have obtained an auth token for your bot,
and know your personal user's numeric ID. If you don't know what this
means, check out the [blog post][] for a full step-by-step guide.

~~~
git clone https://github.com/botgram/shell-bot.git && cd shell-bot
npm install
~~~

To start the bot:

~~~
node server
~~~

The first time you run it, it will ask you some questions and create
the configuration file automatically: `config.json`. You can also
write it manually, see `config.example.json`.

When started it will print a `Bot ready.` message when it's up and running.
For convenience, you might want to talk to the BotFather and set the
command list to the contents of `commands.txt`.

## Authorization

When first started, the bot will just accept messages coming from your user.
This is for security reasons: you don't want arbitrary people to issue
commands to your computer!

If you want to allow another user to use the bot, use `/token` and give
that user the resulting link. If you want to use this bot on a group,
`/token` will give you a message to forward into the group.

## Proxy server

shell-bot obeys the `https_proxy` or `all_proxy` environment variable
to use a proxy, and supports HTTP/HTTPS/SOCKS4/SOCKS4A/SOCKS5 proxies.
Examples:

~~~ bash
export https_proxy=""http://168.63.76.32:3128""
node server

export https_proxy=""socks://127.0.0.1:9050""
node server
~~~

**Warning:** For SOCKS proxies, you need to use an IP address (not a DNS hostname).

- beautifulsoup4
- pyinstaller
- PySocks
- termcolor
- requests
- requests_mock
- yattag
- numpy

### Golang Dependencies
- https://github.com/KingAkeem/gotor (This service needs to be ran in tandem with TorBot)

## Basic setup
Before you run the torBot make sure the following things are done properly:

* Run tor service
`sudo service tor start`

* Make sure that your torrc is configured to SOCKS_PORT localhost:9050

* Install [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/)

* Disable Poetry virtualenvs (not required)
`poetry config settings.virtualenvs.create false`

* Install TorBot Python requirements
`poetry install`

On Linux platforms, you can make an executable for TorBot by using the install.sh script.
You will need to give the script the correct permissions using `chmod +x install.sh`
Now you can run `./install.sh` to create the torBot binary.
Run `./torBot` to execute the program.

An alternative way of running torBot is shown below, along with help instructions.

`python3 torBot.py or use the -h/--help argument`
<pre>
usage: torBot.py [-h] [-v] [--update] [-q] [-u URL] [-s] [-m] [-e EXTENSION]
                 [-i]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            Show this help message and exit
  -v, --version         Show current version of TorBot.
  --update              Update TorBot to the latest stable version
  -q, --quiet           Prevent header from displaying
  -u URL, --url URL     Specifiy a website link to crawl, currently returns links on that page (if used alone e.g. python3 torBot.py -u https://www.github.com)
  -s, --save            Save results to a file in json format
  -m, --mail            Get e-mail addresses from the crawled sites
  -e EXTENSION, --extension EXTENSION
                        Specifiy additional website extensions to the
                        list(.com or .org etc)
  -i, --info            Info displays basic info of the scanned site (very
                        slow)` </pre>

* NOTE: All flags under -u URL, --url URL must also be passed a -u flag.

    abstract=""The dark web has turned into a dominant source of illegal activities. With several volunteered networks, it is      becoming more difficult to track down these services. Open source intelligence (OSINT) is a technique used to gather intelligence on targets by harvesting publicly available data. Performing OSINT on the Tor network makes it a challenge for both researchers and developers because of the complexity and anonymity of the network. This paper presents a tool which shows OSINT in the dark web. With the use of this tool, researchers and Law Enforcement Agencies can automate their task of crawling and identifying different services in the Tor network. This tool has several features which can help extract different intelligence."",

### Easy Way to Deploy

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/Jijinr/Filter-Bot)

## HOW TO DEPLOY YOUTUBE TUTORIAL

<a href=""https://youtu.be/vwLJQlbr4R8""><img src=""https://img.shields.io/badge/How%20To-Deploy-red.svg?logo=Youtube""></a>

### Configuration

```
from bot.sample_config import Config


class Development(Config):
    OWNER_ID = 1118936839  # my telegram ID
    OWNER_USERNAME = ""Sur_vivor""  # my telegram username
    API_KEY = ""your bot api key""  # my api key, as provided by the botfather
    SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI = 'postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/database'  # sample db credentials
    USE_MESSAGE_DUMP = True
    SUDO_USERS = []  # List of id's for users which have sudo access to the bot.
```

If you can't have a config.py file (EG on heroku), it is also possible to use environment variables.
The following env variables are supported:
 - `ENV`: Setting this to ANYTHING will enable env variables

 - `TOKEN`: Your bot token, as a string.
 - `OWNER_ID`: An integer of consisting of your owner ID
 - `OWNER_USERNAME`: Your username

 - `DATABASE_URL`: Your database URL
 - `MESSAGE_DUMP`: optional: a chat where your replied saved messages are stored, to stop people deleting their old 
 - `WEBHOOK`: Setting this to ANYTHING will enable webhooks when in env mode
 messages
 - `URL`: The URL your webhook should connect to (only needed for webhook mode)

 - `SUDO_USERS`: A space separated list of user_ids which should be considered sudo users
 - `SUPPORT_USERS`: A space separated list of user_ids which should be considered support users (can gban/ungban,
 nothing else)
 - `WHITELIST_USERS`: A space separated list of user_ids which should be considered whitelisted - they can't be banned.
 - `DONATION_LINK`: Optional: link where you would like to receive donations.
 - `PORT`: Port to use for your webhooks
 - `DEL_CMDS`: Whether to delete commands from users which don't have rights to use that command
 - `WORKERS`: Number of threads to use. 8 is the recommended (and default) amount, but your experience may vary.
 __Note__ that going crazy with more threads wont necessarily speed up your bot, given the large amount of sql data 
 accesses, and the way python asynchronous calls work.
 - `ALLOW_EXCL`: Whether to allow using exclamation marks ! for commands as well as /.

### Python dependencies

Install the necessary python dependencies by moving to the project directory and running:

`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.

This will install all necessary python packages.

### Database

If you wish to use a database-dependent module (eg: locks, notes, userinfo, users, filters, welcomes),
you'll need to have a database installed on your system. I use postgres, so I recommend using it for optimal compatibility.

In the case of postgres, this is how you would set up a the database on a debian/ubuntu system. Other distributions may vary.

- install postgresql:

`sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install postgresql`

- change to the postgres user:

`sudo su - postgres`

- create a new database user (change YOUR_USER appropriately):

`createuser -P -s -e YOUR_USER`

This will be followed by you needing to input your password.

- create a new database table:

`createdb -O YOUR_USER YOUR_DB_NAME`

Change YOUR_USER and YOUR_DB_NAME appropriately.

- finally:

`psql YOUR_DB_NAME -h YOUR_HOST YOUR_USER`

This will allow you to connect to your database via your terminal.
By default, YOUR_HOST should be 0.0.0.0:5432.

You should now be able to build your database URI. This will be:

`sqldbtype://username:pw@hostname:port/db_name`

Replace sqldbtype with whichever db youre using (eg postgres, mysql, sqllite, etc)
repeat for your username, password, hostname (localhost?), port (5432?), and db name.

### 功能模块控制

HoshinoBot 的功能繁多，各群可根据自己的需要进行开关控制，群管理发送 `lssv` 即可查看功能模块的启用状态，使用以下命令进行控制：

```
启用 service-name
禁用 service-name
```


## 如何开始使用

QQ群[![试用/赞助群](https://img.shields.io/badge/试用/赞助-Hoshinoのお茶会-brightgreen)](https://jq.qq.com/?_wv=1027&k=eYGgrL4A)提供了我们部署的bot，提供Hoshino的原生服务。您可以在这里试用bot功能、赞助开发者，赞助者可邀请bot加入自己的群使用。

本bot功能繁多，部分功能需要静态图片资源和带有认证的api key，恕不能公开。本指南将首先带领您搭建具有**模拟抽卡(纯文字版)**、**会战管理**功能的HoshinoBot。其他功能需额外配置，请参考本章**更进一步**的对应小节。

### 部署步骤

#### Windows 部署

1. 安装下面的软件/工具
    - Python 3.8：https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/
    - Git：https://git-scm.com/download/win
    - Notepad++：https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/

2. 安装 酷Q 及 CQHTTP 插件

    - 酷Q Air：https://cqp.cc/t/23253 （如无法打开，使用此下载直链：https://dlsec.cqp.me/cqa-full）
    - CQHTTP 插件：https://github.com/richardchien/coolq-http-api/releases

    > 初次部署建议先在本地尝试，酷Q Air版即可，待部署成功后再尝试服务器搭建与酷Q Pro版

3. 运行 酷Q，启用 CQHTTP插件，修改CQHTTP插件的配置文件，下面的配置可供参考：

    ```json
    {
        ""use_http"": false,
        ""use_ws"": false,
        ""use_ws_reverse"": true,
        ""ws_reverse_use_universal_client"": true,
        ""ws_reverse_url"": ""ws://127.0.0.1:8080/ws/"",
        ""serve_data_files"": false
    }
    ```

    关于CQHTTP插件的配置说明，详见 [CQHTTP 文档 -> 配置](https://cqhttp.cc/docs/#/Configuration)

4. 打开一个合适的文件夹，点击资源管理器左上角的 `文件 -> 打开Windows Powershell`

5. 输入以下命令克隆本仓库并安装依赖

    ```powershell
    git clone https://github.com/Ice-Cirno/HoshinoBot.git
    cd HoshinoBot
    py -3.8 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    >若此处有报错信息，请务必解决，将错误信息复制到百度搜索一般即可找到解决办法。  
    >
    >若安装python依赖库时下载速度缓慢，可以尝试使用`py -3.8 -m pip install -i https://pypi.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/simple -r requirements.txt`

6. 回到资源管理器，进入`hoshino`文件夹，将`config_example`文件夹重命名为`config`，然后右键使用Notepad++打开其中的`__bot__.py`，按照其中的注释说明进行编辑。

    > 如果您不清楚某项设置的作用，请保持默认
    
7. 回到powershell，启动 Hoshino

    ```powershell
    py -3.8 run.py
    ```

    私聊机器人发送`在？`，若机器人有回复，恭喜您！您已经成功搭建起HoshinoBot了。之后您可以尝试在群内发送`!帮助`以查看会战管理的相关说明，发送`help`查看其他一般功能的相关说明，发送`pcr速查`查看常用网址等。

    注意，此时您的机器人功能还不完全，部分功能可能无法正常工作。若希望您的机器人可以发送图片，或使用其他进阶功能，请参考本章**更进一步**的对应小节。





#### Linux 部署

由于 酷Q 仅支持 Windows 环境，我们需要使用 docker 镜像来部署 酷Q 及 CQHTTP 插件。但别担心，相信我，这比 Windows 下部署更简单！您可以在[这个文档](https://cqhttp.cc/docs/)找到详细的说明。下面将带领您进行部署：

1. 安装 docker：参考https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/debian/

2. 部署 docker：下面一条命令仅供参考，请根据实际情况修改参数；详细说明可见 [CQHTTP 文档 -> Docker](https://cqhttp.cc/docs/#/Docker)

    ```bash
    sudo docker run -d --name=hoshino \
    -v $(pwd)/coolq:/home/user/coolq \
    -p 9000:9000 \
    -e VNC_PASSWD=MAXchar8 \
    -e COOLQ_ACCOUNT=10000 \
    -e COOLQ_URL=https://dlsec.cqp.me/cqp-full \
    -e CQHTTP_SERVE_DATA_FILES=no \
    -e CQHTTP_USE_HTTP=no \
    -e CQHTTP_USE_WS_REVERSE=yes \
    -e CQHTTP_WS_REVERSE_URL=ws://172.17.0.1:8080/ws/ \
    -e CQHTTP_WS_REVERSE_USE_UNIVERSAL_CLIENT=yes \
    richardchien/cqhttp:latest
    ```

    > 使用这行命令`ip addr show docker0 | grep -Po 'inet \K[\d.]+'`查看你的docker桥ip，替换`CQHTTP_WS_REVERSE_URL`中的链接
    >
    > 然后访问 `http://<你的IP>:9000/` 进入 noVNC（默认密码 `MAXchar8`），登录 酷Q
    > 
    > 注：如果你希望先使用酷Q Air进行尝试，请将COOLQ_URL设置为`https://dlsec.cqp.me/cqa-xiaoi`；之后可以用CQP.exe替换CQA.exe以升级，或删除容器重新创建。

3. 回到我们熟悉的命令行，安装 Python 3.8

    ```bash
    # Ubuntu or Debian
    sudo apt install python3.8
    ```
    > 若您的包管理工具（如`yum`）尚不支持`python3.8`，你可以尝试从源码安装。  
    >
    > Google will help you greatly : )

4. 克隆本仓库并安装依赖包
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Ice-Cirno/HoshinoBot.git
    cd HoshinoBot
    python3.8 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

5. 编辑配置文件
    ```bash
    mv hoshino/config_example hoshino/config
    nano hoshino/config/__bot__.py
    ```
    > 配置文件内有相应注释，请根据您的实际配置填写，HoshinoBot仅支持反向ws通信
    >
    > 您也可以使用`vim`编辑器，若您从未使用过，我推荐您使用 `nano` : )
6. 运行bot
    ```bash
    python3.8 run.py
    ```
    
    私聊机器人发送`在？`，若机器人有回复，恭喜您！您已经成功搭建起HoshinoBot了。之后您可以尝试在群内发送`!帮助`以查看会战管理的相关说明，发送`help`查看其他一般功能的相关说明，发送`pcr速查`查看常用网址等。
    
    注意，此时您的机器人功能还不完全，部分功能可能无法正常工作。若希望您的机器人可以发送图片，或使用其他进阶功能，请参考本章**更进一步**的对应小节。

### 更进一步

现在，机器人已经可以使用`会战管理`、`模拟抽卡(纯文字版)`等基本功能了。但还无法使用`竞技场查询`、`番剧订阅`、`推特转发`等功能。这是因为，这些功能需要对应的静态图片资源以及相应的api key。相应资源获取有难有易，您可以根据自己的需要去获取。

下面将会分别介绍资源与api key的获取方法：



#### 静态图片资源

> 发送图片的条件：  
> 1. 静态图片资源

您可能希望看到更为精致的图片版结果，若希望机器人能够发送图片，首先需要您购买酷Q Pro版，其次需要准备静态图片资源，其中包括：

- 公主连接角色头像（来自 [干炸里脊资源站](https://redive.estertion.win/) 的拆包）
- 公主连接官方四格漫画
- 公主连接每月rank推荐表
- 表情包杂图
- setu库
- [是谁呼叫舰队](http://fleet.diablohu.com/)舰娘&装备页面截图
- 艦これ人事表

等资源。自行收集可能较为困难，所以我们准备了一个较为精简的资源包以及下载脚本，可以满足公主连接相关功能的日常使用。如果需要，请加入QQ群 **Hoshino的后花园** 367501912，下载群文件中的`res.zip`。



#### pcrdfans授权key

竞技场查询功能的数据来自 [公主连结Re: Dive Fan Club - 硬核的竞技场数据分析站](https://pcrdfans.com/) ，查询需要授权key。您可以向pcrdfans的作者索要。（注：由于最近机器人搭建者较多，pcrdfans的作者最近常被打扰，我们**不建议**您因本项目而去联系他，推荐您前往网站[pcrdfans.com](https://pcrdfans.com)进行查询）

若您已有授权key，在文件`hoshino/config/priconne.py`中填写您的key：

```python
class arena:
    AUTH_KEY = ""your_key""
```



#### 蜜柑番剧 RSS Token

> 请先在`hoshino/config/__bot__.py`的`MODULES_ON`中取消`mikan`的注释  
> 本功能默认关闭，在群内发送 ""启用 bangumi"" 即可开启

番剧订阅数据来自[蜜柑计划 - Mikan Project](https://mikanani.me/)，您可以注册一个账号，添加订阅的番剧，之后点击Mikan首页的RSS订阅，复制类似于下面的url地址：

```
https://mikanani.me/RSS/MyBangumi?token=abcdfegABCFEFG%2b123%3d%3d
```

保留其中的`token`参数，在文件`hoshino/config/mikan.py`中填写您的token：

```python
MIKAN_TOKEN = ""abcdfegABCFEFG+123==""
```

注意：`token`中可能含有url转义，您需要将`%2b`替换为`+`，将`%2f`替换为`/`，将`%3d`替换为`=`。



#### 时报文本

> 请先在`hoshino/config/__bot__.py`的`MODULES_ON`中取消`hourcall`的注释  
> 本功能默认关闭，在群内发送 ""启用 hourcall"" 即可开启

报时功能使用/魔改了艦これ中各个艦娘的报时语音，您可以在[舰娘百科](https://zh.kcwiki.org/wiki/舰娘百科)或[艦これ 攻略 Wiki](https://wikiwiki.jp/kancolle/)找到相应的文本/翻译，当然您也可以自行编写台词。在此，我们向原台词作者[田中](https://bbs.nga.cn/read.php?tid=9143913)[谦介](http://bbs.nga.cn/read.php?tid=14045507)先生和他杰出的游戏作品表达诚挚的感谢！

若您已获取时报文本，在文件`hoshino/config/hourcall.py`中填写您的文本。

您可以编入多组报时文本，机器人会按`HOUR_CALLS_ON`中定义的顺序循环日替。



#### 推特转发

推特转发功能需要推特开发者账号，具体申请方法请自行[Google](http://google.com)。注：现在推特官方大概率拒绝来自中国大陆的新申请，自备海外手机号及大学邮箱可能会帮到您。

若您已有推特开发者账号，在文件`hoshino/config/twitter.py`中填写您的key：

```python
consumer_key = ""your_consumer_key"",
consumer_secret = ""your_consumer_secret"",
access_token_key = ""your_access_token_key"",
access_token_secret = ""your_access_token_secret""
```



#### 晴乃词库

舰娘及装备查询功能使用了精简版的晴乃词库，如有需要请加 Hoshino的后花园（群号367501912）或联系晴乃维护组。

Strategies from this repo are free to use. Feel free to update them. 
Most of them  were designed from Hyperopt calculations.

Some only work in specific market conditions, while others are more ""general purpose"" strategies.
It's noteworthy that depending on the exchange and Pairs used, further optimization can bring better results.

Please keep in mind, results will heavily depend on the pairs, timeframe and timerange used to backtest - so please run your own backtests that mirror your usecase, to evaluate each strategy for yourself.

## Share your own strategies and contribute to this repo

Feel free to send your strategies, comments, optimizations and pull requests via an 
[Issue ticket](https://github.com/freqtrade/freqtrade-strategies/issues/new) or as a [Pull request](https://github.com/freqtrade/freqtrade-strategies/pulls) enhancing this repository.

## FAQ

### What is Freqtrade?

[Freqtrade](https://github.com/freqtrade/freqtrade) Freqtrade is a free and open source crypto trading bot written in Python.
It is designed to support all major exchanges and be controlled via Telegram. It contains backtesting, plotting and money management tools as well as strategy optimization by machine learning.

### What includes these strategies?

Each Strategies includes:  

- [x] **Minimal ROI**: Minimal ROI optimized for the strategy.
- [x] **Stoploss**: Optimimal stoploss.
- [x] **Buy signals**: Result from Hyperopt or based on exisiting trading strategies.
- [x] **Sell signals**: Result from Hyperopt or based on exisiting trading strategies.
- [x] **Indicators**: Includes the indicators required to run the strategy.

Best backtest multiple strategies with the exchange and pairs you're interrested in, and finetune the strategy to the markets you're trading.

### How to install a strategy?

First you need a [working Freqtrade](https://freqtrade.io).

Once you have the bot on the right version, follow this steps:

1. Select the strategy you want. All strategies of the repo are into 
[user_data/strategies](https://github.com/freqtrade/freqtrade-strategies/tree/master/user_data/strategies)
2. Copy the strategy file
3. Paste it into your `user_data/strategies` folder
4. Run the bot with the parameter `--strategy <STRATEGY CLASS NAME>` (ex: `freqtrade trade --strategy Strategy001`)

More information [about backtesting](https://www.freqtrade.io/en/latest/backtesting/) and [strategy customization](https://www.freqtrade.io/en/latest/strategy-customization/).

### How to test a strategy?

Let assume you have selected the strategy `strategy001.py`:

#### Simple backtesting

```bash
freqtrade backtesting --strategy Strategy001
```

#### Refresh your test data

```bash
freqtrade download-data --days 100
```

*Note:* Generally, it's recommended to use static backtest data (from a defined period of time) for comparable results.

Please check out the [official backtesting documentation](https://www.freqtrade.io/en/latest/backtesting/) for more information.

## Update 2018-08-14
Tag v0.1 has the code which follows this README. Tag v0.2 is a major overhaul after lessons learned in a finance job, and much of this README won't match the new code. I can't get tests to converge in either case, so something is fundamentally missing from this project - ie, don't count on making money (use as a starting-point / education instead). I'm stepping away for a while and won't be very active here, but I'm not completely abandoning.

[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/lefnire/tforce_btc_trader](https://badges.gitter.im/lefnire/tforce_btc_trader.svg)](https://gitter.im/lefnire/tforce_btc_trader?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

A [TensorForce](https://github.com/reinforceio/tensorforce)-based Bitcoin trading bot (algo-trader). Uses deep reinforcement learning to automatically buy/sell/hold BTC based on price history.

This project goes with Episode 26+ of [Machine Learning Guide](http://ocdevel.com/podcasts/machine-learning). Those episodes are tutorial for this project; including an intro to Deep RL, hyperparameter decisions, etc.

### 1. Setup
- Python 3.6+ (I use template strings a lot)
- Install & setup Postgres
  - Create two databases: `btc_history` and `hyper_runs`. You can call these whatever you want, and just use one db instead of two if you prefer (see Data section).
  - `cp config.example.json config.json`, pop ^ into `config.json`
- Install [TA-Lib](https://github.com/mrjbq7/ta-lib) manually.
- `pip install -r requirements.txt`
  - If issues, try installing these deps manually.
- Install TensorForce from git repo (constantly changing, we chase HEAD)
  - `git clone https://github.com/lefnire/tensorforce.git`
  - `cd tensorforce && pip install -e .`

Note: you'll wanna run this on a GPU rig with some RAM. I'm using a 1080ti and 16GB RAM; 8GB+ is often in used. You _can_ use a standard PC, no GPU (CPU-only); in that case `pip install -I tensorflow==1.5.0rc1` (instead of `tensorflow-gpu`). The only downside is performance; CPU is _way_ slower than GPU for ConvNet computations. Worth evaluating this repo on a CPU before you decide ""yeah, it's worth the upgrade.""

### 2. Populate Data
- Download [mczielinski/bitcoin-historical-data](https://www.kaggle.com/mczielinski/bitcoin-historical-data)
- Extract to `data/bitcoin-historical-data`
- `python -c 'from data.data import setup_runs_table;setup_runs_table()'`
  - if you get `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'data.data'`, prefix commands with `PYTHONPATH=. python ...`
  - If you have trouble with that, just copy/paste the SQL from that file, execute against your `hyper_runs` DB from above.

### 3. Hypersearch
The crux of practical reinforcement learning is finding the right hyper-parameter combo (things like neural-network width/depth, L1 / L2 / Dropout numbers, etc). Some papers have listed optimal default hypers. Eg, the Proximate Policy Optimization (PPO) [paper](https://blog.openai.com/openai-baselines-ppo/) has a set of good defaults. But in my experience, they don't work well for our purposes (time-series / trading). I'll keep my own ""best defaults"" updated in this project, but YMMV and you'll very likely need to try different hyper combos yourself. The file `hypersearch.py` will search hypers forever, ever honing in on better and better combos (using Bayesian Optimization (BO), see `gp.py`). See Hypersearch section below for more details.

`python hypersearch.py`

Optional flags:
- `--guess <int>`: sometimes you don't want BO, which is pretty willy-nilly at first, to do the searching. Instead you want to try a hunch or two of your own first. See instructions in `utils.py#guess_overrides`.
- `--net-type <lstm|conv2d>`: see discussion below (LSTM v CNN)
- `--boost`: you can optionally use gradient boosting when searching for the best hyper combo, instead of BO. BO is more exploratory and thorough, gradient boosting is more ""find the best solution _now_"". I tend to use `--boost` after say 100 runs are in the database, since BO may still be dilly-dallying till 200-300 and daylight's burning. Boost will suck in the early runs.
- `--autoencode`: many of you might hit some GPU RAM constraints (hypersearch crashes due to maxed memory). If so, use this flag. It dimensionality-reduces the price-history timesteps so more can fit into RAM. It does so destructively - think of lossy image compression - but might be required for your case. See [#6](https://github.com/lefnire/tforce_btc_trader/issues/6#issuecomment-364179764) for info on what leads to mem-maxing.
- `--n-steps <int>`, `--n-tests <int>`: vary how long to train and how often to report. `n-steps` is number of timesteps to train (in 10k; ie `--n-steps 100` means 1M). `n-tests` is how many times to split that and report back to you / save an entry for viz.

### 4. Run
Once you've found a good hyper combo from above (this could take days or weeks!), it's time to run your results.

`python run.py --name <str>`

- `--name <str>` (required): name of the folder to save your run (during training) or load from (during `--live/--test-live`.
- `--id <int>`: the id of some winning hyper-combo you want to run with. Without this, it'll run from the hard-coded hyper defaults.
- `--early-stop <int>`: sometimes your models can overfit. In particular, PPO can give you great performance for a long time and then crash-and-burn. That kind of behavior will be obvious in your visualization (below), so you can tell your run to stop after x consecutive positive episodes (depends on the agent - some find an optimum and roll for 3 positive episodes, some 8, just eyeball your graph).
- `--live`: whooa boy, time to put your agent on GDAX and make real trades! I'm gonna let you figure out how to plug it in on your own, 'cause that's danger territory. I ain't responsible for shit. In fact, let's make that real - disclaimer at the end of README.
- `--test-live`: same as `live`, but without making the real trades. This will start monitoring a live-updated database (from config.json), same as `live`, but instead of making the actual trade, it pretends it did and reports back how much you would have made/lost. Dry-run. You'll definitely want to run this once or twice before running `--live`.

First, run `python run.py [--id 10] --name test`. This will train your model using run 10 (from `hypersearch.py`) and save to `saves/test`. Without `--id` it will use the hard-coded deafults. You can hit `Ctrl-C` _once_ during training to kill training (in case you see a sweet-spot and don't want to overfit).
Second, run `python run.py [--id 10] --name test --[test-]live` to run in live/test-live mode. If you used `--id` before, use it again here so that loading the model matches it to its net architecture.

## 5. Visualize
TensorForce comes pre-built with reward visualization on a TensorBoard. Check out their Github, you'll see. I needed much more customization than that for viz, so we're not using TensorBoard. I created a mini Flask server (2 routes) and a D3 React dashboard where you can slice & dice hyper combos, visualize progression, etc. If you click on a single run, it'll display a graph of the buy/sell signals that agent took in a time-slice (test-set) so you can eyeball whether he's being smart.

- Server: `cd visualize;FLASK_APP=server.py flask run`
- Client:
  - `cd visualize/client`
  - `npm install;npm install -g webpack-dev-server`
  - `npm start` => localhost:8080

It uses deep reinforcement learning to automatically buy/sell/hold BTC based on what it learns about BTC price history. Most blogs / tutorials / boilerplate BTC trading-bots you'll find out there use supervised machine learning, likely an LTSM. That's well and good - supervised learning learns what makes a time-series tick so it can predict the next-step future. But that's where it stops. It says ""the price will go up next"", but it doesn't tell you what to do. Well that's simple, buy, right? Ah, buy low, sell high - it's not that simple. Thousands of lines of code go into trading rules, ""if this then that"" style. Reinforcement learning takes supervised to the next level - it _embeds_ supervised within its architecture, and then decides what to do. It's beautiful stuff! Check out:

- [Sutton & Barto](http://amzn.to/2EWvnVf): de-facto textbook on RL basics

- [Machine Learning for Trading](https://www.udacity.com/course/machine-learning-for-trading--ud501): teaches you algo-trading, stock stuff, and applied RL.

This project goes with Episode 26+ of [Machine Learning Guide](http://ocdevel.com/podcasts/machine-learning). Those episodes are tutorial for this project; including an intro to Deep RL, hyperparameter decisions, etc.


### Data
For this project I recommend using the Kaggle dataset described in Setup. It's a really solid dataset, best I've found! I'm personally using a friend's live-ticker DB. Unfortunately you can't. It's his personal thing, he may one day open it up as a paid API or something, we'll see. There's also some files in `data/populate` which use the CryptoWat.ch API. Great API _going forward_, but doesn't have the history you'll need to train on. If any y'all find anything better than the Kaggle set, LMK.

So here's how this project splits up databases (see `config.json`). We start with a `history` DB, which has all the historical BTC prices for multiple exchanges. Import it, train on it. Then we have an optionally separate `runs` database, which saves the results of each of your `hypersearch.py` runs. This data is used by our BO or Boost algo to search for better hyper combos. You can have `runs` table in your `history` database if you want, one-and-the-same. I have them separate because I want the `history` DB on localhost for performance reason (it's a major perf difference, you'll see), and `runs` as a public hosted DB, which allows me to collect runs from separate AWS p3.8xlarge running instances.

Then, when you're ready for live mode, you'll want a `live` database which is real-time, constantly collecting exchange ticker data. `--live` will handle keeping up with that database. Again, these can all 3 be the same database if you want, I'm just doing it my way for performance.

### LSTM v CNN
You'll notice the `--net-type <lstm|conv2d>` flag in `hypersearch.py` and `run.py`. This will select between an LSTM Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). I have them broken out of the hypersearch since they're so different, they kinda deserve their own `runs` DB each - but if someone can consolidate them into the hypersearch framework, please do. You may be thinking, ""BTC prices is time-series, time-series is LSTM... why CNN?"" It strangely turns out that LSTM doesn't do so hot here. In my own experience, in colleagues' experience, and in 2-3 papers I've read ([here's one](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.10059.pdf)) - we're all coming to the same conclusion. We're not sure why... the running theory is vanishing/exploding gradient. LSTMs work well in NLP which has some maximum 50-word sentences or so. LSTMs mitigated vanilla RNN's vanishing/exploding gradient for such sentences, true - but BTC history is infinite (on-going). Maybe LSTM can only go so far with time-series. Another possibility is that Deep Reinforcement Learning is most commonly researched, published, and open-sourced using CNNs. This because RL is super video-game centric, self-driving cars, all the vision stuff. So maybe the math behind these models lends better to CNNs? Who knows. The point is - experiment with both. Report back on Github your own findings.

So how does CNN even make sense for time-series? Well we construct an ""image"" of a time-slice, where the x-axis is time (obviously), the y-axis (height) is nothing... it's [1]. The z-axis (channels) is features (OHLCV, VWAP, bid/ask, etc). This is kinda like our agent literally looking at an image of price actions, like we do when day-trading, but a bit more robot-friendly / less human-friendly.

[Update March 04 2018]: I'm having better success recently w/ LSTMs and have made that the default. A change in TensorForce perhaps?

### Reinforcement Models

TensorForce has all sorts of models you can play with. This project currently only supports Proximate Policy Optimization (PPO), but I encourage y'all to add in other models (esp VPG, TRPO, DDPG, ACKTR, etc) and submit PRs. ACKTR is the current state-of-the-art Policy Gradient model, but not yet available in TensorForce. PPO is the second-most-state-of-the-art, so we're using that. TRPO is 3rd, VPG is old. DDPG I haven't put much thought into.

Those are the Policy Gradient models. Then there's the Q-Learning approaches (DQNs, etc). We're not using those because they only support discrete actions, not continuous actions. Our agent has one discrete action (buy|sell|hold), and one continuous action (how much?). Without that ""how much"" continuous flexibility, building an algo-trader would be... well, not so cool. You could do something like (discrete action = (buy-$200, sell-$200, hold)), but I dunno man... continuous is slicker.

### Hypersearch

You're likely familiar with _grid search_ and _random search_ when searching for optimial hyperparameters for machine learning models. Grid search searches literally every possible combo - exhaustive, but takes infinity years (especially w/ the number of hypers we work with in this project). Random search throws a dart at random hyper combos over and over, and you just kill it eventually and take the best. Super naive - it works ok for other ML setups, but in RL hypers are the make-or-break; more than model selection. Seriously, I've found L1 / L2 / Dropout selection more consequential than PPO vs DQN, LSTM vs CNN, etc.

That's why we're using Bayesian Optimization (BO). Or sometimes you'll hear Gaussian Processes (GP), the thing you're optimizing with BO. See `gp.py`. BO starts off like random search, since it doesn't have anything to work with; and over time it hones in on the best hyper combo using Bayesian inference. Super meta - use ML to find the best hypers for your ML - but makes sense. Wait, why not use RL to find the best hypers? We could (and I tried), but deep RL takes 10s of thousands of runs before it starts converging; and each run takes some 8hrs. BO converges much quicker. I've also implemented my own flavor of hypersearch via Gradient Boosting (if you use `--boost` during training); more for my own experimentation.

We're using `gp.py`, which comes from [thuijskens/bayesian-optimization](https://github.com/thuijskens/bayesian-optimization). It uses scikit-learn's in-built GP functions. I also considered dedicated BO modules, like GPyOpt. I found `gp.py` easier to work with, but haven't compared it's relative performance, nor its optimal hypers (yes, BO has its own hypers... it's turtles all the way down. But luckily I hear you can pretty safely use BO's defaults). If anyone wants to explore any of that territory, please indeed!

### License: AGPLv3.0

GPL bit so we share our findings. Community effort, right? Boats and tides. Affero bit so we can all run our own trading instances w/ personal configs / mods. Heck, any of us could run this as a service / hedge fund. I'm pretty keen on this license, having used it in a prior [internet company](https://habitica.com) I'd founded; but if someone feels strongly about a different license, please open an issue & LMK - open to suggestions. See LICENSE.

### Disclaimer

By using this code you accept all responsibility for money lost because of this code.

FYI, I haven't made a dime. Doubtful the project as-is will fly. It could benefit from add-ons, like some NLP fundamentals functionality. But it's a start!

**BottomPopup provides a popup-like presentation style to any view controller**

![](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-0.6.0-blue.svg)
![](https://img.shields.io/badge/platform-ios-lightgrey.svg)
![](https://img.shields.io/badge/swift-4.2-orange.svg)
![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Contact-ergunemr%40gmail.com-yellowgreen.svg)

## What does BottomPopup do?
It is a custom presentation style for view controllers to present any view controller with slide animation from bottom of the screen.

## What does it look like ?
Actually depends on your view controller, a real world examples can be seen below;

![](https://media.giphy.com/media/Cjtdn4GdOy4F80voe0/giphy.gif) | ![](https://media.giphy.com/media/58FNuaDbPyyc8IdRtB/giphy.gif)

## How is it set up?

**Using CocoaPods (Recommended)**

Add below line to your Podfile;

```
pod 'BottomPopup'
```

Then you can install it with pod install command.

**Manual**

Download the project, just drag and drop classes under **BottomPopupController** file to your project.

## How is it used?

After install, simply make your view controller subclass of **BottomPopupViewController.**  

For navigation controllers, it works exactly in same way, make your navigation controller subclass of **BottomPopupNavigationController.**

Congratulations, your view controller is ready to show 🎉

Then you can present your controller with native **presentViewController:animated:completion:** method, bottom popup controller will handle rest.

## Customization

Bottom popup comes with couple of customizable properties. Since your view controller subclass of BottomPopupViewController now, **you can override following properties in your view controller** to change behaviour;

* **_popupShouldDismissInteractivelty: Bool_**
  
  Determines the popup should dismiss whether interactively or not. If it is set to yes, user can dismiss popup with pulling down it down. Default is YES
* **_popupHeight: BOOL_**
  
  Height value. Default is 377 pt. For example you can return UIScreen.main.bounds.size.height to give it full screen height.
* **_popupTopCornerRadius: BOOL_**
  
  Corner radius of popup. Default is 10pt
* **_popupPresentDuration: Double_**
   
   Present animation duration. Default is 0.5 sec
* **_popupDismissDuration: Double_**
   
   Dismiss animation duration. Default is 0.5 sec

* **_popupDimmingViewAlpha: CGFloat_**
   
   Target alpha value of the black-colored dimming view after present animation. Default is 0.5

* **_popupShouldBeganDismiss: BOOL_**
   
   Basically controls whether user can close the popup or not. You can change this variable at the runtime to control dismiss behaviour on spesific actions. Tap on dimming view, swipe down on dimming view and pan gesture on popup dont work if this variable set to false during these actions

* **_popupViewAccessibilityIdentifier: String_**
   
   Accessibility identifier of popup's view. Default is _bottomPopupView_
   
   You can see how changing of these properties changes popup's behaviour below.
   (Gifs are extracted from example project)
    
    UIViewController  | UINavigationController

## Delegate

If you want to track popup lifecycle or current dismiss interaction percent, you can set popupDelegate;

```
popupVC.popupDelegate = self
```

Methods;
```
func bottomPopupViewLoaded()
func bottomPopupWillAppear()
func bottomPopupDidAppear()
func bottomPopupWillDismiss()
func bottomPopupDidDismiss()

# [Microsoft Cognitive Services](https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services) control for [Microsoft Bot Builder V3](https://github.com/Microsoft/BotBuilder-V3)

## V3 Deprecation Notification

Microsoft Bot Framework SDK V4 was released in September 2018, and since then we have shipped a few dot-release improvements. As announced previously, the V3  SDK is being retired with final long-term support ending on December 31st, 2019.
Accordingly, there will be no more development in this repo. **Existing V3 bot workloads will continue to run without interruption. We have no plans to disrupt any running workloads**.

We highly recommend that you start migrating your V3 bots to V4. In order to support this migration we have produced migration documentation and will provide extended support for migration initiatives (via standard channels such as Stack Overflow and Microsoft Customer Support).

## Description

The cognitive services control makes consuming different Microsoft Cognitive Services easy for bots developed using [Microsoft Bot Builder](https://github.com/microsoft/botbuilder) SDK. The control is available for [C#](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Bot.Builder/) and [Node.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/botbuilder) SDKs.

Currently the control has support for the following cognitive services:

- [QnA Maker](https://qnamaker.ai/): This service enables developers to build, train and publish a simple question and answer bot based on FAQ URLs, structured documents or editorial content. The bot can consume the QnA Maker dialog implemented by this control to forward the conversation to QnA Maker service and relay back the answers to the user.

- [LUIS.ai](https://luis.ai): Language Understanding Intelligent Service (LUIS) enables developers to build smart applications that can understand human language and react accordingly to user requests. There are times when you may want to link an intent to an action at client side (e.g.: in your Bot, or web app, or even a console app), with an easy binding logic for it, where you can also resolve complex things in order to fulfill an user's intent.

144,144,maxbbraun/trump2cash,Python,"# Trump2Cash

This bot watches [Donald Trump's tweets](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump)
and waits for him to mention any publicly traded companies. When he does, it
uses sentiment analysis to determine whether his opinions are positive or
negative toward those companies. The bot then automatically executes trades on
the relevant stocks according to the expected market reaction. It also tweets
out a summary of its findings in real time at
[@Trump2Cash](https://twitter.com/Trump2Cash).

*You can read more about the background story [here](https://trump2cash.biz).*

[![Trump2Cash](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1400/1*VbnhlLnZz0KvWO0QsM5Ihw.png)](https://trump2cash.biz)

The code is written in Python and is meant to run on a
[Google Compute Engine](https://cloud.google.com/compute/) instance. It uses the
[Twitter Streaming APIs](https://dev.twitter.com/streaming/overview) to get
notified whenever Trump tweets. The entity detection and sentiment analysis is
done using Google's
[Cloud Natural Language API](https://cloud.google.com/natural-language/) and the
[Wikidata Query Service](https://query.wikidata.org/) provides the company data.
The [TradeKing API](https://developers.tradeking.com/) does the stock trading.

The [`main`](main.py) module defines a callback where incoming tweets are
handled and starts streaming Trump's feed:

```python
def twitter_callback(tweet):
    companies = analysis.find_companies(tweet)
    if companies:
        trading.make_trades(companies)
        twitter.tweet(companies, tweet)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    twitter.start_streaming(twitter_callback)
```

The core algorithms are implemented in the [`analysis`](analysis.py) and
[`trading`](trading.py) modules. The former finds mentions of companies in the
text of the tweet, figures out what their ticker symbol is, and assigns a
sentiment score to them. The latter chooses a trading strategy, which is either
buy now and sell at close or sell short now and buy to cover at close. The
[`twitter`](twitter.py) module deals with streaming and tweeting out the
summary.

Follow these steps to run the code yourself:

### 1. Create VM instance

Check out the [quickstart](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/quickstart-linux)
to create a Cloud Platform project and a Linux VM instance with Compute Engine,
then SSH into it for the steps below. Pick a predefined
[machine type](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/machine-types) matching
your preferred price and performance.

#### Container

Alternatively, you can use the [`Dockerfile`](Dockerfile) to build a
[Docker container](https://www.docker.com/what-container) and
[run it on Compute Engine](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/containers/deploying-containers)
or other platforms.

```shell
docker build -t trump2cash .
docker tag trump2cash gcr.io/<YOUR_GCP_PROJECT_NAME>/trump2cash
docker push gcr.io/<YOUR_GCP_PROJECT_NAME>/trump2cash:latest
```

### 2. Set up auth

The authentication keys for the different APIs are read from shell environment
variables. Each service has different steps to obtain them.

#### Twitter

Log in to your [Twitter](https://twitter.com/) account and
[create a new application](https://apps.twitter.com/app/new). Under the *Keys
and Access Tokens* tab for [your app](https://apps.twitter.com/) you'll find
the *Consumer Key* and *Consumer Secret*. Export both to environment variables:

```shell
export TWITTER_CONSUMER_KEY=""<YOUR_CONSUMER_KEY>""
export TWITTER_CONSUMER_SECRET=""<YOUR_CONSUMER_SECRET>""
```

If you want the tweets to come from the same account that owns the application,
simply use the *Access Token* and *Access Token Secret* on the same page. If
you want to tweet from a different account, follow the
[steps to obtain an access token](https://dev.twitter.com/oauth/overview). Then
export both to environment variables:

```shell
export TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN=""<YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN>""
export TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=""<YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET>""
```

#### Google

Follow the
[Google Application Default Credentials instructions](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/application-default-credentials#howtheywork)
to create, download, and export a service account key.

```shell
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=""/path/to/credentials-file.json""
```

You also need to [enable the Cloud Natural Language API](https://cloud.google.com/natural-language/docs/getting-started#set_up_your_project)
for your Google Cloud Platform project.

#### TradeKing

Log in to your [TradeKing](https://www.tradeking.com/) account and
[create a new application](https://developers.tradeking.com/applications/CreateApplication).
Behind the *Details* button for
[your application](https://developers.tradeking.com/Applications) you'll find
the *Consumer Key*, *Consumer Secret*, *OAuth (Access) Token*, and *Oauth (Access)
Token Secret*. Export them all to environment variables:

```shell
export TRADEKING_CONSUMER_KEY=""<YOUR_CONSUMER_KEY>""
export TRADEKING_CONSUMER_SECRET=""<YOUR_CONSUMER_SECRET>""
export TRADEKING_ACCESS_TOKEN=""<YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN>""
export TRADEKING_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=""<YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET>""
```

Also export your TradeKing account number, which you'll find under
*[My Accounts](https://investor.tradeking.com/Modules/Dashboard/dashboard.php)*:

```shell
export TRADEKING_ACCOUNT_NUMBER=""<YOUR_ACCOUNT_NUMBER>""
```

### 3. Install dependencies

There are a few library dependencies, which you can install using
[pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/quickstart/):

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Run the tests

Verify that everything is working as intended by running the tests with
[pytest](https://doc.pytest.org/en/latest/getting-started.html) using this
command:

```shell
export USE_REAL_MONEY=NO && pytest *.py -vv
```

### 5. Run the benchmark

The [benchmark report](benchmark.md) shows how the current implementation of the
analysis and trading algorithms would have performed against historical data.
You can run it again to benchmark any changes you may have made. You'll need a [Polygon](https://polygon.io) account:

```shell
export POLYGON_API_KEY=""<YOUR_POLYGON_API_KEY>""
python benchmark.py > benchmark.md
```

### 6. Start the bot

Enable real orders that use your money:

```shell
export USE_REAL_MONEY=YES
```

Have the code start running in the background with this command:

```shell
nohup python main.py &
```

* Part 2: https://extropy-io.medium.com/arbitrage-bot-part-2-97e7b710dcf

### Core Research Question

* How can an arbitrage between DEXes be automatically performed using flash loans?

### Background

* **Arbitrage** is the purchase and sale of an asset in order to profit from a difference in the asset’s price between marketplaces.
* **Price slippage** refers to the difference between the expected price of a trade and the price at which the trade is executed. It usually happens when the market is highly volatile within a short period of time or when the current trade volume exceeds the existing bid/ask spread.
* **Flash Loan** is a type of uncollateralized loan that is only valid within a single transaction. It can be implemented through a smart contract. The transaction will be reverted if the execution result is not as expected.
  * For more details on flash loans, please refer to the research summary “[Attacking the DeFi Ecosystem with Flash Loans for Fun and Profit](https://www.smartcontractresearch.org/t/research-summary-attacking-the-defi-ecosystem-with-flash-loans-for-fun-and-profit/260)”.
* **Decentralized exchanges (DEX)** are a type of cryptocurrency exchange which allow peer-to-peer cryptocurrency exchanges to take place securely online, without needing an intermediary.
* **DEX aggregators** source liquidity from different DEXs and thus offer users better token swap rates than any single DEX.
* **Liquidity pool** is a collection of funds locked in a smart contract to provide liquidity for DEXes. The advantage of a liquidity pool is that it doesn’t require matching orders between buyers and sellers, and instead leverages a pre-funded liquidity pool with low slippage.
* An **Orderbook** consists of a collection of bid-and-ask orders. Orders are matched and executed only when a bid and ask price are the same.
* An **Automated Market Maker (AMM)** uses a liquidity pool instead of an orderbook and relies on mathematical formulas to price assets. The assets can be automatically swapped against the pool’s latest price, making it more efficient than traditional orderbooks.
* **Wrapped ETH (WETH)** is the ERC20 tradable version of Ethereum. WETH is easier to trade within smart contracts than ETH is. Users can also revoke access to their WETH after sending it to an exchange, which is not possible with ETH.

### Summary

* The author describes the advantages of DeFi arbitrage over centralized exchanges:
  * DeFi
    * Insolvency risks are minimized as smart contracts execute automatically following predetermined parameters. A trade will be reverted if it cannot be executed as expected.
    * Traders can perform arbitrage using borrowed funds with flash loans.
  * Centralized exchanges
    * Since a trader cannot execute trades simultaneously, they may suffer from price slippage if a trade is delayed.
    * Traders need to own funds or borrow them from a bank.
* Arbitrage between DEXes that use AMM
  * Popular platforms
    * [Kyber Network](https://kyber.network/), [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/), [Balancer](https://balancer.finance/), and [Curve Finance](https://curve.fi/).
  * Result
    * Bring prices into efficiency between two liquidity pools
  * Scenario
    * When the pools on different DEXes offer different prices to exchange assets.
  * Execution
    * Exchange from asset A to asset B on one pool and exchange it back on another pool to benefit from the price spread between two pools.
* Arbitrage between DEXes that use classic orderbook
  * Popular platforms
    * [Radar Relay](https://relay.radar.tech/), powered by the [0x protocol](https://0x.org).
  * Scenario
    * Traders can fill limit orders from a DEX and then see if the tokens acquired could be sold to any other liquidity pools for better returns.
* The author describes the basic operation of an arbitrage bot.
  * For example, to arbitrage the pair WETH/DAI:
  * The bot will query the [0x API](https://0x.org/api) looking for WETH/DAI pair limit orders
    * The 0x API can get the limit orders for a currency pair from every exchange that uses the 0x protocol.
    * Example API url for orders buying WETH with DAI: https://api.0x.org/sra/v3/orders?page=1&perPage=1000&makerAssetProxyId=0xf47261b0&takerAssetProxyId=0xf47261b0&makerAssetAddress=0xc02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2&takerAssetAddress=0x6b175474e89094c44da98b954eedeac495271d0f
      * Parameters
        * the maker token’s contract address (WETH)
        * the taker token’s contract address (DAI)
      * Sample response from the above request
      * ![|512x215](upload://4yiFnlZcJCpmtPuCTK22fGOjV45.jpeg)
      * However, the above opportunity may not actually exist in practice, because we would need both limit orders to exist at the same time for the arbitrage to work.
* The author thus proposes to perform the arbitrage using a flash loan.
  * Steps
    * Get a flash loan DAI from [DyDx exchange](https://dydx.exchange/)
    * Buy WETH from 0x using the DAI borrowed with the flash loan
    * Use 1inch to find the best exchange to sell the WETH acquired in step 2
    * Pay back the flash loan DAI and keep the remainder as profit
* The author provides the code and explains how the arbitrage smart contract works
  * The contract inherits the DyDxFloashLoan smart contract.
  * Functions
    * Swap
      * Perform the trade
    * getExpectedReturn
      * Get the current asset price
    * getWeth
      * Turn any ETH sent into WETH
    * approveWeth
      * Approve the 0x proxy to collect WETH as the fee for using 0x.
    * getFlashloan
      * Called whenever a profitable arbitrage is found by the client.
      * All of the parameters for this function will be constructed and passed in from the client script.
    * callFunction
      * Has to be deployed in our smart contract to receive a flash loan from dYdX.
    * _arb
      * Arbitrage function that is called when the loan is successful.
      * Tracks the balance of our smart contract before and after the trade.
      * If the end balance is not greater than the start balance, the operation will revert.

### Method

* The prerequisite for the arbitrage bot is to have a browser with the Metamask extension installed.
* The programming language used is NodeJS.
* Project structure: only two files
  * index.js
    * a node.js server that continuously fetches crypto prices on exchanges looking for arbitrage opportunities, trying to guarantee that the trade is possible before even attempting to execute it.
  * TradingBot.sol
    * a smart contract that gets called by the node app only when a profitable arbitrage is found, it will borrow funds with a flash loan and execute trades on DEXes.
* Detailed setup
  * Install Metamask browser extension
  * Create an Ethereum Mainnet account with some ETH for paying gas fees.
    * Don’t use your personal account for this, create a new account for the bot in order to limit accidental losses.
  * Go to [Remix online IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/) and paste the smart contract solidity code
  * Compile the code using compiler version 0.5.17.
  * Deploy with an initial 100 wei, which is enough for 100 flash loans on dYdX.
* Environment setup
  * By cloning the project’s code repository, users will find a file called .env.example inside the /src folder
  * Fill in the fields:
    * RPC_URL : the public address of an Ethereum node, the easiest one to set up is the Infura RPC provider, register an account in order to get an API key.
    * ADDRESS and PRIVATE_KEY: fill in the public Ethereum address of the bot account, and its corresponding private key.
    * CONTRACT_ADDRESS : paste in the smart contract’s address that was returned from Remix after the deployment step.
    * GAS_LIMIT : how much gas the contract is allowed to use, leave as 3000000 or decrease to 2000000 which should be fine
    * GAS_PRICE : change this depending on how fast you want the transaction to be mined, see https://ethgasstation.info/ for info.
    * ESTIMATED_GAS : leave as is
* Running the bot
  * Execute the command from the project’s root directory.
    * node src/index.js

### Results

* The full working code can be found at https://github.com/ExtropyIO/defi-bot.

### Discussion & Key Takeaways

* The author created an open-source DeFi arbitrage bot that uses flash loans to borrow assets from dYdX and sells them on 1inch exchange when profitable.
* The author explains the main components of the arbitrage bot and the underlying logic of how arbitrage works.
* After following this tutorial, users can create a working example of a customizable flash loan arbitrage bot.
* The most efficient way to perform a flash loan arbitrage is to continuously fetch the real time prices using NodeJS client and execute the contract with profitable parameters when an opportunity is found.

### Implications & Follow-ups

* Arbitrage is a zero-sum game. There are a finite number of arbitrage opportunities for a large group of people competing to find and execute them.
* To make the bot more efficient, the author suggests the following improvements:
  * Consider taker fees when calculating profits
  * Use Partial fills
  * Check orders again
  * Handle failures to continue execution
  * Execute multiple orders simultaneously
  * Dynamically calculate gas fees
* If such arbitrage bot becomes prevalent, the price differences between different DEXes will be minimized. DEX aggregators such as 1inch may no longer be needed as the price differences become more and more negligible in the future.
* It may be interesting to measure the actual APR of running this bot, considering the cost of server hosting and contract deployment.

### Applicability

* Interested readers can refer to the working code to have their own arbitrage bot: https://github.com/ExtropyIO/defi-bot.
* Currently, the example only supports flash loans from dYdX. Users can add other flash loan provider’s support."

[![Build Status](https://github.com/line/line-bot-sdk-php/actions/workflows/php-checks.yml/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/line/line-bot-sdk-php/actions)


## Introduction

The LINE Messaging API SDK for PHP makes it easy to develop bots using LINE Messaging API, and you can create a sample bot within minutes.


## Documentation

See the official API documentation for more information.

- English: https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/messaging-api/overview/
- Japanese: https://developers.line.biz/ja/docs/messaging-api/overview/


## Requirements

- PHP 5.6 or later


## Installation

Install the LINE Messaging API SDK using [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/).

```
$ composer require linecorp/line-bot-sdk
```

## Getting started

### Create the bot client instance

The bot client instance is a handler of the Messaging API.

```php
$httpClient = new \LINE\LINEBot\HTTPClient\CurlHTTPClient('<channel access token>');
$bot = new \LINE\LINEBot($httpClient, ['channelSecret' => '<channel secret>']);
```

The constructor of the bot client requires an instance of `HTTPClient`.
This library provides `CurlHTTPClient` by default.

### Call API

You can call an API through the bot client instance.

A very simple example:

```php
$response = $bot->replyText('<reply token>', 'hello!');
```

This procedure sends a message to the destination that is associated with `<reply token>`.

A more advanced example:

```php
$textMessageBuilder = new \LINE\LINEBot\MessageBuilder\TextMessageBuilder('hello');
$response = $bot->replyMessage('<reply token>', $textMessageBuilder);
if ($response->isSucceeded()) {
    echo 'Succeeded!';
    return;
}

// Failed
echo $response->getHTTPStatus() . ' ' . $response->getRawBody();
```

`LINEBot#replyMessage()` takes the reply token and `MessageBuilder`.
The method sends a message that is built by `MessageBuilder` to the destination.

## Components

### MessageBuilder

The type of message that is sent depends on the type of instance of `MessageBuilder`.
For example, the method sends a text message if you pass `TextMessageBuilder` and it sends an image message if you pass `ImageMessageBuilder`.

For more detailed information on `MessageBuilder`, see `\LINE\LINEBot\MessageBuilder` and the namespace.

Other methods that take `MessageBuilder` behave in the same way.

### Response

Methods that call API returns `Response`. A `Response` instance has following methods:

- `Response#isSucceeded()`
- `Response#getHTTPStatus()`
- `Response#getRawBody()`
- `Response#getJSONDecodedBody()`
- `Response#getHeader($name)`
- `Response#getHeaders()`

You can use these methods to check the response status and take response body.

#### `Response#isSucceeded()`

Returns a Boolean value. The return value represents whether the request succeeded or not.

#### `Response#getHTTPStatus()`

Returns the HTTP status code of a response.

#### `Response#getRawBody()`

Returns the body of the response as raw data (a byte string).

#### `Response#getJSONDecodedBody()`

Returns the body that is decoded in JSON. This body is an array.

#### `Response#getHeader($name)`

This method returns a response header string, or null if the response does not have a header of that name.

#### `Response#getHeaders()`

This method returns all of the response headers as string array.

### Webhook

LINE's server sends user actions (such as a message, image, or location) to your bot server.
Request of that contains event(s); event is action of the user.

The following shows how the webhook is handled:

1. Receive webhook from LINE's server.
2. Parse request payload by `LINEBot#parseEventRequest($body, $signature)`.
3. Iterate parsed events and some react as you like.

The following examples show how webhooks are handled:

- [EchoBot: Route.php](/examples/EchoBot/src/LINEBot/EchoBot/Route.php)
- [KitchenSink: Route.php](/examples/KitchenSink/src/LINEBot/KitchenSink/Route.php)

More information
--

For more information, see the [official API documents](#documentation) and PHPDoc.
If it's your first time using this library, we recommend taking a look at `examples` and the PHPDoc of `\LINE\LINEBot`.

Hints
--

### Examples

This repository contains two examples of how to use the LINE Messaging API.

#### [EchoBot](/examples/EchoBot)

A simple sample implementation. This application reacts to text messages that are sent from users.

#### [KitchenSink](/examples/KitchenSink)

A full-stack (and slightly complex) sample implementation. This application demonstrates a practical use of the LINE Messaging API.

### PHPDoc

[https://line.github.io/line-bot-sdk-php/](https://line.github.io/line-bot-sdk-php/)

This library provides PHPDoc to describe how to use the methods. You can generate the documentation using [phpDocumenter](https://docs.phpdoc.org/) using the following command.

```
$ wget https://github.com/phpDocumentor/phpDocumentor/releases/download/v3.0.0/phpDocumentor.phar
$ php phpDocumentor.phar run -d src -t docs
```

The HTML files are generated in `docs/`.

### Official API documentation

[Official API documents](#documentation) shows the detail of  Messaging API and fundamental usage of SDK.

Notes
--

### How to switch the HTTP client implementation

1. Implement `\LINE\LINEBot\HTTPClient`
2. Pass the implementation to the constructor of `\LINE\LINEBot`

Please refer [CurlHTTPClient](/src/LINEBot/HTTPClient/CurlHTTPClient.php) that is the default HTTP client implementation.

### [line-bot-sdk-tiny](./line-bot-sdk-tiny)

A very simple SDK (subset) for the LINE Messaging API for PHP.
line-bot-sdk-tiny provides a simple interface and functions which makes it a good way to learn how to use the LINE Messaging API.

### Laravel Support
Easy to use from Laravel.
After installed, add `LINE_BOT_CHANNEL_ACCESS_TOKEN` and `LINE_BOT_CHANNEL_SECRET` to `.env`

```
LINE_BOT_CHANNEL_ACCESS_TOKEN=<Channel Access Token>
LINE_BOT_CHANNEL_SECRET=<Channel Secret>
```

then you can use `LINEBot` facade like following.

```
$profile = \LINEBot::getProfile($userId);
```

        android:icon=""@drawable/ic_print_grey_600_24dp""
        android:title=""Print"" />

</menu>
```

Then create a BottomSheetMenuDialogFragment via the Builder class using either the Builder method calls for java
or named arguments for Kotlin 
```java
new BottomSheetMenuDialogFragment.Builder(getActivity())
  .setSheet(R.menu.bottom_sheet)
  .setTitle(R.string.options)
  .setListener(myListener)
  .setObject(myObject)
  .show(getSupportFragmentManager());
  ```
  
  ```kotilin
  BottomSheetMenuDialogFragment.Builder(context = this,
        sheet = R.menu.bottom_sheet,
        listener = myListener,
        title = R.string.options,
        `object` = myObject)
        .show(supportFragmentManager)
  ```
# Styling
BottomSheetMenu comes with both a Light and Dark theme to accommodate most scenarios. However, if you want to customize itr more, you can create your own style and supply it to the builder.
</br> Customizable attributes are:
```xml
<!-- The text appearance of the title -->
<attr name=""bottom_sheet_menu_title_text_appearance"" format=""reference"" />

<!-- The number of columns to show when using the grid style -->
<attr name=""bottom_sheet_menu_column_count"" format=""integer"" />

<!-- The text appearance of the list items -->
<attr name=""bottom_sheet_menu_list_text_appearance"" format=""reference"" />

<!-- The text appearance of the grid items -->
<attr name=""bottom_sheet_menu_grid_text_appearance"" format=""reference"" />
```
    
Then create a style
```xml  
<style name=""MyBottomSheetMenuStyle"" parent=""@style/Theme.BottomSheetMenuDialog"">
    <item name=""bottom_sheet_menu_title_text_appearance"">@style/TitleAppearance</item>
    <item name=""bottom_sheet_menu_list_text_appearance"">@style/ListAppearance</item>
    <item name=""bottom_sheet_menu_grid_text_appearance"">@style/GridAppearance</item>
</style>

<style name=""TitleAppearance"" parent=""BottomSheetMenu.Title.TextAppearance"">
    <item name=""android:textColor"">@android:color/holo_green_light</item>
</style>

<style name=""ListAppearance"" parent=""BottomSheetMenu.ListItem.TextAppearance"">
    <item name=""android:textColor"">@android:color/holo_red_light</item>
    <item name=""android:textSize"">18sp</item>
</style>

<style name=""GridAppearance"" parent=""BottomSheetMenu.GridItem.TextAppearance"">
    <item name=""android:textColor"">@android:color/holo_red_light</item>
    <item name=""android:textSize"">20sp</item>
</style>
```
Also note that each of these pre-defined styles also have a light and DayNight theme. They are named similary with a `.Light` or `DayNight` added to the end of the style name</br>
`@style/Theme.BottomSheetMenuDialog.Light` `@style/BottomSheetMenu.Title.TextAppearance.Light` etc...


Then finally pass the style into the `Builder` object.
```java
new BottomSheetMenuDialogFragment.Builder(getActivity(), R.style.MyBottomSheetStyle)
  .setSheet(R.menu.bottom_sheet)
  .setTitle(R.string.options)
  .setListener(myListener)
  .show();
```

```kotlin
BottomSheetMenuDialogFragment.Builder(context = this,
        sheet = R.menu.bottom_sheet,
        title = R.string.options,
        listener = myListener,
        style = R.style.MyBottomSheetStyle)
        .show(supportFragmentManager)
```

# Share Intents
BottomSheetMenu can also be used to create a Share Intent Picker that will be styled like the ones found in Android 5.x+. To create one, simply call one of the static  ```createShareBottomSheet``` methods.
```kotlin
Intent(Intent.ACTION_SEND).apply {
    type = ""text/*""
    putExtra(Intent.EXTRA_TEXT, ""My text to share"")
    // Make sure to check that the createBottomSheet method does not return null!! 
    // If the device can not handle the intent, null will be returned
    BottomSheetMenuDialogFragment.createShareBottomSheet(context, this, ""My Title"")?.show(supportFragmentManager, null)
}
```
For further customization of the share intent including which apps will be either be shown or not shown, see the full signature of [createBottomSheet](https://github.com/Kennyc1012/BottomSheetMenu/blob/master/library/src/main/java/com/kennyc/bottomsheet/BottomSheetMenuDialogFragment.kt#L50)


# Callbacks
BottomSheetMenu uses the [BottomSheetListener](https://github.com/Kennyc1012/BottomSheetMenu/blob/master/library/src/main/java/com/kennyc/bottomsheet/BottomSheetListener.kt) for callbacks
```kotlin
 /**
     * Called when the [BottomSheetMenuDialogFragment] is first displayed
     *
     * @param bottomSheet The [BottomSheetMenuDialogFragment] that was shown
     * @param object      Optional [Object] to pass to the [BottomSheetMenuDialogFragment]
     */
    fun onSheetShown(bottomSheet: BottomSheetMenuDialogFragment, `object`: Any?)

    /**
     * Called when an item is selected from the list/grid of the [BottomSheetMenuDialogFragment]
     *
     * @param bottomSheet The [BottomSheetMenuDialogFragment] that had an item selected
     * @param item        The item that was selected
     * @param object      Optional [Object] to pass to the [BottomSheetMenuDialogFragment]
     */
    fun onSheetItemSelected(bottomSheet: BottomSheetMenuDialogFragment, item: MenuItem, `object`: Any?)

    /**
     * Called when the [BottomSheetMenuDialogFragment] has been dismissed
     *
     * @param bottomSheet  The [BottomSheetMenuDialogFragment] that was dismissed
     * @param object       Optional [Object] to pass to the [BottomSheetMenuDialogFragment]
     * @param dismissEvent How the [BottomSheetMenuDialogFragment] was dismissed. Possible values are: <br></br>
     *  * [.DISMISS_EVENT_SWIPE]
     *  * [.DISMISS_EVENT_MANUAL]
     *  * [.DISMISS_EVENT_ITEM_SELECTED]
     */
    fun onSheetDismissed(bottomSheet: BottomSheetMenuDialogFragment, `object`: Any?, @DismissEvent dismissEvent: Int)
```

# Upgrading to 4.X

- An app's style should inherit from a MaterialComponent theme. Material3 themes are preferred but not required. 
- Removed `bottom_sheet_menu_selector` attribute
- Removed various resources
- Java 11 is now required to compile project
- MinSdk is now 21, also targeting API 31

# Upgrading to 3.X
- `BottomSheet` has been renamed to `BottomSheetMenuDialogFragment`
- Custom views and simple messages are no longer supported. Please use a [BottomSheetDialogFragment](https://developer.android.com/reference/com/google/android/material/bottomsheet/BottomSheetDialogFragment) and customize it from there
- Many of the theme attributes have been removed or renamed. See the Styling section above for current values
- CollaspingView has been removed. 
- Migration to [AndroidX](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/) and [Google Material Components](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-android)
- MinSdk is now 19, also targeting API 28

# Upgrading From 1.x
When upgrading to 2.x from a 1.x release, some changes will have to be made.
- All of the builder methods for settings colors have been removed. All customzing should be done through themes.
- The style attributes have been change to text appearances rather than colors.
- The Builder constructor no longer takes a menu object. You will need to call ```setSheet(...)```.
- The ```onSheetDismissed``` callback now takes an int as an argument for simple message support. 
- The gradle dependency has changed and needs to be updated.

# easy-peasy-bot

## The story of a (Slack)bot

A (not so) long time ago, a team called Tiny Speck built an app to communicate with each other as they worked.
In their daily work, they found that there were some mindless tasks they had to do over and over. These things pulled them out of important conversations, which slowed them down.

So, they built a special user in their messaging app: not a human user, but a digital user. The digital user took on some of their mindless tasks and integrated the other apps they used into their conversations.

Eventually their app was named Slack and their digital user, Slackbot.
And lo, you can build a Slack Bot, too! With our API and this nifty repository, a bot for your team can be all yours.

# Using Botkit for Custom Bots
1. Fork this project.
2. Open up your favorite terminal app, and clone your new repository to your local computer.
3. This is a Node.js project, so you’ll need to install the various dependencies by running:
    npm install
4. Edit `package.json` to give your bot a name and update the GitHub URLs to reflect the location of your fork in GitHub.
5. Go to https://my.slack.com/apps/new/A0F7YS25R-bots and pick a name for your new bot.
6. Once you’ve clicked “Add integration,” you’ll be taken to a page where you can further customize your bot. Of importance is the bot token—take note of it now.
7. Once you have the token, you can run your bot easily:

    ```bash
    TOKEN=xoxb-your-token-here npm start
    ```

    Your bot will now attempt to log into your team, and you should be able talk to it. Try telling your new bot “hello”. It should say “Hello!” back!

8. Botkit is structured around event listeners. The most important is the “hear” listener, which kicks off an action when your bot hears something. `index.js` contains the core logic, and has this event listener:

    ```javascript
    controller.hears('hello','direct_message', function(bot,message) {
        bot.reply(message, 'Hello!');
    });
    ```

    This event handler is triggered when the bot receives a direct message from a user that contains the word “hello.”

    The bot responds in the direct message with, “Hello!”

9. You can listen to any kind of message or you can configure your bot to only listen to direct messages or specific @-mentions of your bot. It’s up to you! To start let’s re-write the event listener to be more  flexible about the greetings it is listening for:
    ```javascript
    controller.hears(['hello', 'hi', 'greetings'], ['direct_mention', 'mention', 'direct_message'], function(bot,message) {
         bot.reply(message, 'Hello!');
     });
    ```

    Now our bot will respond any time it sees “hello,” “hi,” or “greetings” in either a DM or a message that @-mentions the bot. (Don’t forget to restart your bot after each edit!)

## Hurrah! Welcome to Level 2

You’ve built your first bot in Slack, and it’s not just a Hello World bot—it’s a Hi World and Greetings World bot too!

At this point you will probably want to start doing more sophisticated things, like making requests to external services, so your bot can respond with timely and useful information (depending on what your bot does, of course). There’s a lot more to Botkit than this! You can learn more about Botkit’s awesome features by simply perusing the [Botkit documentation](http://howdy.ai/botkit/docs/).

Once you’ve got your bot developed to your liking, it is ready to be deployed to your own hosting framework. No other configuration is necessary, except storing the token and desired port in environment variables.

```

## Tips
* Use `index` command or run [one_time_indexer.py](one_time_indexer.py) file to save old files in the database that are not indexed yet.
* You can use `|` to separate query and file type while searching for specific type of file. For example: `Avengers | video`
* If you don't want to create a channel or group, use your chat ID / username as the channel ID. When you send a file to a bot, it will be saved in the database.

[Discord](https://discord.gg/mTp4awX9wB)<br/><br/>
Phoenix Bot is inspired by Natewong1313's Bird Bot project yet due to lack of activity by their team. We have decided to revive this project to achieve a common goal. Due to the recent insurgence of botters/scalpers taking advantage, our goal is to enable everyone the ability to combat these botters/scalpers by implementing their own botting system. Currently, this auto-checkout bot will support Walmart, Best Buy, Gamestop, & Target. There are more plans for future implementations later on. 

* Easy to use interface built on PyQt5
* Waits for items to restock if they are out of stock
* Optional price checker
* Lighting fast auto-checkout

## Current Functionality

| **Website** | **Auto Checkout** | **Open Cart Link** | **Work In Progress** |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| amazon.com | | |`✔`|
| bestbuy.com |`✔`|`✔`| |
| gamestop.com | |`✔`|`✔`|
| target.com |`✔`| |`✔`|
| walmart.com |`✔`| | |

Gamestop - Captcha work-arounds in progress, will attempt to add to cart currently and then open browser for you to click captcha's.

Target Signin error work around - Wait for target browser to launch, once it's refreshing on product page, open new tab in browser, navigate to target.com and signin manually, then close that tab.

## Contributing
This project uses pip-compile with the --generate-hashes flag to validate dependencies via checksums. This helps prevent updates to existing package versions on PyPI from adding new code to our project. When changing requirements, make updates in the requirements.in file, then compile using the command below to update requirements.txt before committing.
```
pip-compile --generate-hashes --no-index --output-file=requirements.txt requirements.in
```
If you receive an error when running this command related to pinning a version of pip, make sure your system or virtualenv pip version is up to date by running the following command:
```
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

"
158,158,rubensousa/BottomSheetBuilder,Java,"# BottomSheetBuilder
A simple library that creates BottomSheets according to the Material Design specs: https://material.google.com/components/bottom-sheets.html

Available from API 14.

## Screenshots
<img src=""screens/normal_demo.gif"" width=""350"">

<img src=""screens/tablet_demo.gif"">

<img src=""screens/tablet_grid.png"">

## How to use

- Add the following to your build.gradle:
```groovy
dependencies {
  implementation 'com.github.rubensousa:bottomsheetbuilder:1.6.1'
  implementation 'com.android.support:design:27.1.1'
}
```

- Create a view (the builder already inflates the view inside the coordinatorLayout):
```java
View bottomSheet = new BottomSheetBuilder(context, coordinatorLayout)
        .setMode(BottomSheetBuilder.MODE_GRID)
        .setBackgroundColor(android.R.color.white)
        .setMenu(R.menu.menu_bottom_grid_sheet)
        .setItemClickListener(this)
        .createView();
```
- Create a BottomSheetMenuDialog:
```java
BottomSheetMenuDialog dialog = new BottomSheetBuilder(context, R.style.AppTheme_BottomSheetDialog)
              .setMode(BottomSheetBuilder.MODE_LIST)
              .setMenu(R.menu.menu_bottom_simple_sheet)
              .setItemClickListener(new BottomSheetItemClickListener() {
                        @Override
                        public void onBottomSheetItemClick(MenuItem item) {
                                
                        }
                })
              .createDialog();
              
dialog.show();
```
- If you have a long view, you should consider adding the AppBarLayout to the builder so that the dialog doesn't overlap with it:

```java
BottomSheetMenuDialog dialog = new BottomSheetBuilder(context, R.style.AppTheme_BottomSheetDialog)
              .setAppBarLayout(appbar)
              ...
```
- If you want to expand the dialog automatically:

```java
BottomSheetMenuDialog dialog = new BottomSheetBuilder(context, R.style.AppTheme_BottomSheetDialog)
              .expandOnStart(true)
              ...
```

- If you want to tint the menu icons:
```java
BottomSheetMenuDialog dialog = new BottomSheetBuilder(context, R.style.AppTheme_BottomSheetDialog)
              .setIconTintColorResource(R.color.colorPrimary)
              ...
```

## Styling

Make sure the style passed in the BottomSheetBuilder's constructor extends from the Theme.Design.BottomSheetDialog family:
```xml
<style name=""AppTheme.BottomSheetDialog"" parent=""Theme.Design.Light.BottomSheetDialog"">
    <item name=""bottomSheetStyle"">@style/AppTheme.BottomSheetStyle</item>
</style>

<style name=""AppTheme.BottomSheetStyle"" parent=""Widget.Design.BottomSheet.Modal"">
    <item name=""behavior_hideable"">true</item>
    <item name=""behavior_skipCollapsed"">true</item>
</style>
```

You can also style the background and text colors as of 1.5:
```xml
<style name=""AppTheme.BottomSheetDialog.Custom"" parent=""AppTheme.BottomSheetDialog"">
    <item name=""bottomSheetBuilderItemTextColor"">@color/colorPrimaryDark</item>
    <item name=""bottomSheetBuilderBackgroundColor"">@android:color/white</item>
    <item name=""bottomSheetBuilderTitleTextColor"">@color/colorAccent</item>
</style>
```
## Sample

The sample includes 4 view modes: grid, list, long list and list with one submenu.

======

Optimist Prime is a Facebook Messenger Bot that supports Voice Recognition, Natural Language Processing and features such as: search nearby restaurants, search trending news, transcribe and save memos to the cloud. It also save user data (with permissions, of course) such as favorite locations, can provide customized greetings (acknowledging user's time in any time zone, i.e. Good morning/Good evening) and entertaining responses, etc.

## Usage

> Note: Optimist Prime is implemented with different APIs for features like user management, voice recognition, restaurant search, trending news search, so it takes some time to config & get it up and running. For a more basic ""echo bot"" that responses to you whatever you say to it, use **`facebook-echobot.py`**, or head over to Facebook's own Messenger app [Quick Start](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/quickstart/). The echo bot is useful to get a quick glance of the fundamental ideas behind a Facebook Messenger Bot.

#### Dependencies, Database and API keys

In order to build your own bot with all features of Optimist Prime, you'll need a few set-ups:

0. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt` (preferably getting into your virtual environment `virtualenv`/`venv` - read all about `pip` and `venv` [here](https://packaging.python.org/installing/))
1. [Create a Facebook Page](https://www.facebook.com/pages/create/): A bare-bone Page to ""assign"" the Bot to will do. The Bot will actually be this page, i.e. you'll be ""talking"" to the page
2. [Create a Facebook App](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/apps/register), get its Page Access Token (details at Facebook's [Quick Start](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/quickstart/))
3. Create a MongoDB database (User management, Conversational Context management, Logging), a local MongoDB is fine ([Tutorial](https://scotch.io/tutorials/an-introduction-to-mongodb) to set up a local instance). I used [Heroku's mLab MongoDB](https://elements.heroku.com/addons/mongolab). It'll take you 10 minutes to get a Heroku account and set up a MongoDB database there.

Then a few configurations in `config.py`:

1. MongoDB database credentials (created above)
2. Yelp API key (Business/Restaurant Search feature): [Get one here](https://www.yelp.com/developers/manage_api_keys) (More details below, as Yelp now has a stable v2 API and a developer preview v3)
3. IBM Watson Speech-to-Text API username & password: [Get one here](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/) (More details below)
4. Simsimi: [Get one here](http://developer.simsimi.com/) (Free 7-day trial key)
5. Define your own local config: create a folder called `instance`, and create another `config.py` file in it. ([More on Flask configurations](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.11/config/))

To run locally, as simple as:
```bash
python facebookbot.py 3000
```
Or with `gunicorn` (as I do on Heroku) ([Flask and gunicorn tutorial](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-serve-flask-applications-with-gunicorn-and-nginx-on-ubuntu-14-04))
```bash
gunicorn facebookbot:app -b localhost:3000
```

Now that you've got the bot running, you'll need to set up a webhook for Facebook to send messages the bot receives to. This could be done with `ngrok`, which will set up a secure tunnel to your localhost server:
```bash
./ngrok http 3000
```
![ngrok](https://monosnap.com/file/HJckHGSorOuoEqm6kBNFb7MQWdNeHf.png)

Get the `https` URL (Facebook requires `https` secured webhooks) and subscribe your Facebook App to this webhook. The verification token is your own token defined in `OWN_VERIFICATION_TOKEN` in `config.py`.

![webhook](https://monosnap.com/file/LJITuhaxURs7MXpDQrvDKBk7yIrBER.png)

##### Deploying to the cloud

I've provided the Procfile for deployment on **Heroku**. You can create a Heroku app, spin up a free dyno and deploy your own Optimist Prime with [this tutorial](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-python#introduction).

For the voice recognition to work, we'll need to include `ffmpeg` on our Heroku dyno, which could be done by adding a Heroku Buildpack to your app's Settings tab on Dashboard:
`https://github.com/jonathanong/heroku-buildpack-ffmpeg-latest.git`
![buildpack](https://monosnap.com/file/KrXLU25L6NEWvP36lNO4GgCOLWF419.png)

Finally, set your environment variable for the path to `ffmpeg`:
```bash
heroku config:set FFMPEG_PATH=/app/vendor/ffmpeg/ffmpeg
```
Or on your app’s settings tab on Dashboard:
![configvar](https://monosnap.com/file/eipdi9mPeKyQDTLvQWMcNUHEtJZ7lG.png)

Now you're ready to deploy. [Tutorial on how to deploy with Heroku and git](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/git).

In later iterations, all you need to do with Heroku is the glorious 3 lines:
```bash
git add .
git commit -am ""Awesome commit""
git push heroku master
```

**Amazon Web Service**: I'm a fan of AWS and have had great experience with Beanstalk. However, if you want to use AWS, you'll need to go the extra mile of obtaining an SSL cert to have a secured webhook. For the purposes of Optimist Prime, I decided to go with Heroku instead, since it readily provides a `https` connections.


## Voice Recognition
The Voice Recognition is implemented with both [IBM Watson's Speech-to-Text API](https://www.ibm.com/watson/developercloud/speech-to-text.html) and [Google Cloud Speech API](https://cloud.google.com/speech/) (default to IBM Watson as Google Cloud Speech is still in Beta, and my tests showed Watson so be more accurate). The current implementation is based on their RESTful methods (both support real time processing with WebSocket and WebRTC, respectively). Both are available for free at development-level use.

To use IBM Watson's Speech-to-Text, you'll need to create a [IBM Bluemix account](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/) and add the service to your account, then retrieve the API's username and password. Lastly, copy these credentials to `Speech/credentials.py`.

![The Bluemix Console](https://monosnap.com/file/Z20JjWmcyZCth9oSAIEyg0aZVB1JTr.png)

To use Google Cloud Speech API, the process is a little bit more complicated as you'll need to export Google's credentials as a environment variable. However, the whole process is well-documented by Google over here. As soon as you have got the Service Account key file (json) and exported `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable to the key file's location, you're set to go.

To switch between IBM Watson and Google for speech recognition: Setting the environment variable as follow:
```bash
export FB_BOT_STT_API_PROVIDER=GOOGLE
export FB_BOT_STT_API_PROVIDER=IBM
```

The result text processed by this Speech-to-Text API is then returned just like a text message the bot receives, which then goes through NLP for detecting commands/conversations.

## Natural Language Processing

Optimist Bot receives commands from users as both text and voice input, and understands commands in natural language. 

This is done by using the `pattern` NLP [library](http://www.clips.ua.ac.be/pages/pattern-en), which allows the bot to deconstruct the user's text input and recognize parts of speech. For now, the model for categorizing commands are simple with stopwords and sentence structures, but as our data grows, we can start building more complex machine learning categorization for each function.

The command system allows users to use the following features, all of which are under the `Utils` folder.

## Custom features

### 1. Business/Restaurant Search

Example commands:
```
		irish bar near by.
		find chinese restaurants.
		find me a good coffee shop around here.
		show me Chinese food close by.
		find mexican restaurants near here.
		I want to have vietnamese food tonight.
		is there a korean bbq nearby?
		what are some cambodian grill close by?
		find an ethiopian restaurant.
		I want mediterranean food.
		find a Target.
		find me a KFC around.
		I'd like to eat at McDonalds.
		find me some fast food places in ohio city.
		find me a brewery near downtown san francisco.
```

After receiving the command, Optimist Prime would ask for your location. You can input either a text/voice-based **location name** or send your **exact GPS location** (with Facebook Messenger on mobile devices). The Yelp Search API requires a coordinate for exact location search, so the reverse lookup from location-name to coordinate is handled by the the geocoding capability of the Geopy library. An alternative (probably more updated and smarter with complex names) would be [Google Maps Geocoding API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/intro). Optimist Prime currently uses `Geopy`. Optimist Prime also offers to save your location for future reference.
![Smart Location Search](https://monosnap.com/file/5ox1ff0xx1l6r2cjTD7o7Gcb8aqgKF.png)

Optimist Prime leverage Yelp's API. Included in the code is both the APIv2 (stable) and APIv3 (developer preview). Both require you to acquire their API key.

[Get API key for v2](https://www.yelp.com/developers/manage_api_keys)

[Get API key for v3](https://www.yelp.com/developers/v3/preview)

After you've got your API key, put them into `config.py`

To switch between v2 and v3, change the `import` statement in `facebookbot.py` between `yelp_search_v2` and `yelp_search_v3`

```python
from Utils.Yelp import yelp_search_v3 as yelp_search
```

### 2. Trending News Search

Example commands:
```
	get me news about Harvard.
    find news about Zika.
    get me some news about the US presidential elections.
    Get trending news about the US in the Olympics.
    look for latest news on the Olympics.
```
![News Search](https://monosnap.com/file/wTn8lqcV1mgryNs5bMEG2LFcCQb1ff.png)

The Trending News Search leverages [Webhose.io API](https://webhose.io/SDK). The service crawls the web for news along with its social strength (Facebook likes, Shares, Twitter posts). In case of user searching for not-so-trending or niche topics, Optimist Prime lowers its ""trending"" criteria as well as search time frame to get the best results.

### 3. Memo

Example commands:
```
	memorize this for me: [continue speaking your memo]
	memorize this: [continue speaking your memo]
	memorize this (stop talking, Optimist Prime will prompt you to start your memo)
	can you memorize this for me?
```
![Memo](https://monosnap.com/file/cYHCLLXhdSTPeQi0qtTl3dhF7S209k.png)

This feature is still in its infancy/concept. After the user saves a memo, s/he can access it on the web with the link provided by the bot.

The unfortunate catch I found was that Facebook uses different user_ids for Facebook Profile (which is used for login) and Messenger. A same account would have 2 different user_ids, and the bot only receives the Messenger user_id from the Messenger API, thus making the implementation of a secured Facebook Login feature impossible. My current solution is to allow users to access their own memo inside the bot chat using user_ids as URL paths for querying. Future: We might use Account Linking for this.

## Discussion

#### The nitty-gritty detail of implementing voice recognition & scalability

The catch for processing voice messages from the Facebook Messenger API is **converting Facebook's compressed mp3 to a valid input format** for the Speech-to-Text API. Both IBM and Google do not support mp3, and their input format include principle audio formats like WAV, FLAC, OGG, etc. Therefore, Optimist Prime actually has to download the mp3 audio, convert it to WAV, and upload it to the Speech API, which is a round trip that significantly increases response time for each audio command. In this project, I used `ffmpeg` and call it with Python's `subprocess` to convert the audio.

> `subprocess` is a Python tool that allows you to trigger command line-like commands, so what the program does is equivalent to it calling another program ""by typing this command into the command line""

![ffmpeg in subprocess](https://monosnap.com/file/LWCiJmkZsTRcgeEBXRr5xGBU4gzIpi.png)

Under the hood, the bot does the following:
- Receive json of the user's audio command
- Download this audio file
- Use `ffmpeg` to convert:
	+ Use Python `subprocess` to initiate a native ffmpeg command (just as you would do in the command shell)
	+ Get the converted audio output into a pipe as a file blob
	+ Return this file blob
- Upload the converted audio file blob to the Speech API

This approach takes the output of `ffmpeg` directly from the pipe and upload it without saving it to a temp file and then uploading the file. 

The story behind it was a learning experience on Heroku: Everything works perfectly on local, but when deployed to Heroku, Python keeps saying the file previously downloaded is not found. I ssh-ed into the Heroku dyno, and fascinatingly nothing was ever downloaded. I suspect this has to do with either: Heroku ephemeral file system (which does not allow program to save file due to the fact that it is a distributed system - but I highly doubt this hypothesis), or that I needed to use absolute path for any read/write operation on Heroku. I'm leaning more to the latter, as the same problem happened for `subprocess` to call `ffmpeg`, as I had to explicitly declare the path to ffmpeg (pictured above).

This poses a questions of scalability (on theory): multiple concurrent conversions could max out the memory as this is done in the pipe. However, I believe this would not be the bottle-neck at scale, as most audio files tend to be less than 1MB, so for multiple users, the bottle-neck would lie in the connection to download/upload files, instead of the memory to convert all these files. Files would be done with conversion before another file is done downloading. This hypothesis has to be tested.

When a user sends an audio to the bot, the bot will ""receive"" an URL to the file, as processed in the code below in the main bot file `facebookbot.py`:

[**PhantomBot**](https://phantombot.github.io/PhantomBot) is a Twitch chat bot powered by Java. PhantomBot has many modern features out of the box such as a built-in webpanel, enhanced moderation, games, a point system, raffles, custom commands, a music player, and more. PhantomBot can also be integrated with many services such as [Discord](https://discordapp.com/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com), [TipeeeStream](https://tipeeestream.com), [StreamLabs](https://streamlabs.com) and [StreamElements](https://streamelements.com)!

Additional functionality is enabled through the use of third-party modules.

## Upgrading PhantomBot

Detailed upgrade instructions are listed on our [documentation](https://phantombot.github.io/PhantomBot/guides/#guide=content/setupbot/updatebot).

## License

PhantomBot is licensed under the [**GNU General Public License v3 (GPL-3)**](https://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html).

## Rollbar Exception Reporting
:information_source: ***Notice:*** As of Phantombot Nightly Build 49687f9 (July 4, 2021) and PhantomBot v3.5.0, we now use [Rollbar](https://rollbar.com) to automatically report exceptions to the dev team.

OAuth tokens, Client IDs, and API Secrets are **NOT** sent. All information is kept private.

Data is only sent when an exception occurs. Some very common, safe to ignore, exceptions are not sent, such as the ones that occur when shutting down the bot while an active panel connection exists.

Exceptions are sent through a server owned by @gmt2001 for additional filtering before continuing on to Rollbar. No data is saved on this server beyond normal logs used for DDOS mitigation. These logs may include IP addresses and are deleted after 5 weeks. IP addresses are **NOT** sent on to Rollbar.

The following values are sent from _botlogin.txt_:
- _allownonascii_ - Indicates if other config values in _botlogin.txt_ are allowed to use non-US-ASCII characters
- _baseport_ - Indicates the port that the built-in webserver listens on
- _channel_ - Indicates the Broadcaster's channel, where the bot interacts with Twitch viewers
- _datastore_ - Indicates which database backend is used
- _debugon_ - Indicates whether debug messages are printed to the console and logged
- _debuglog_ - Overrides the above to only log, but not print to console
- _helixdebug_ - Enables additional debug logging of Twitch Helix API requests and responses (Not including OAuth tokens)
- _ircdebug_ - Enables additional debug logging of incoming messages from Twitch Message Interface (TMI/IRC)
- _logtimezone_ - Indicates the timezone used by the bot
- _msglimit30_ - Indicates the self-imposed rate-limit on outgoing messages to TMI
- _musicenable_ - Indicates whether the YouTube player has been enabled at the _botlogin.txt_ level
- _owner_ - Indicates the bot owner (used for giving a non-broadcaster bot owner admin privileges)
- _proxybypasshttps_ - Overrides the SSL checks in the bot to pretend SSL is enabled, for use with a reverse proxy
- _reactordebug_ - Enables very verbose debug output to console from the Netty backend (Helix and Discord API)
- _reloadscripts_ - Indicates whether the bot is allowed to reload most JavaScript files when they are changed without a restart
- _rhinodebugger_ - Enables verbose debug output when JavaScript exceptions occur
- _rollbarid_ - A [GUIDv4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GUID#Version_4_(random)) which uniquely identifies the current PhantomBot installation, used for identifying when multiple exceptions are coming from the same bot
- _twitch\_tcp\_nodelay_ - The TCP_NODELAY flag for TMI. Makes TMI less bandwidth efficient but possibly a little faster on outbound messages
- _usehttps_ - Indicates whether SSL is enabled on the bots built-in webserver
- _user_ - The bots Twitch username
- _useeventsub_ - Indicates if EventSub is enabled
- _userollbar_ - Indicates if Rollbar exception reporting is enabled
- _webenable_ - Indicates if the bots built-in webserver is enabled
- _whisperlimit60_ - Indicates the self-imposed rate-limit on outgoing whispers to TMI
- _wsdebug_ - Enables debug output of WebSocket messages from the panel

For all other values in _botlogin.txt_, only an indicator of whether the value exists will be sent, but not the actual value itself.

The other data sent includes:
- _java.home_ - Indicates where Java is installed
- _java.specification.name_ - Indicates the specification of the Java Runtime Environment the Java installation adheres to
- _java.specification.vendor_ - Indicates the vendor of the above specification
- _java.specification.version_ - Indicates the version of the above specification
- _java.vendor_ - Indicates the vendor of the actual Java installation
- _java.version_ - Indicates the actual version of the Java installation
- _os.arch_ - Indicates 32-bit or 64-bit operating system
- _os.name_ - Indicates the name of the operating system
- _os.version_ - Indicates the version of the operating system
- The current state of _debugon_, even if set from the console
- The current state of _debuglog_, even if set from the console
- A boolean indicator of whether the OAuth is logged in as the Bot (but not the actual OAuth token)
- A boolean indicator of whether the API OAuth is logged in as the Broadcaster (but not the actual OAuth token)
- The full stack trace of the exception

To opt out of Rollbar exception reporting, add the following line to the _botlogin.txt_:
```
userollbar=false
```

Docker users can opt out using the above method, or by adding the following environment variable to the container:
```
PHANTOMBOT_USEROLLBAR=false
```

for docker-compose.yml
```
PHANTOMBOT_USEROLLBAR: ""false""
```

You must restart the bot after putting the opt-out for the change to take effect. Editing a Docker container or docker-compose may require more steps to apply the changes, consult your manual.

If you believe your data has already been sent and want to issue a GDPR delete request, please opt out as above and then send your bot name, broadcaster name, and  the _rollbarid_ from _botlogin.txt_ to: **gdpr** /A\T/ phantombot // hopto \\ org

We also accept requests for copies of your data. GDPR requests are accepted from all users, even those who do not live in a locale that has such laws.

Please note that the IP addresses in the DDOS logs can not be retrieved or deleted manually, but will be automatically deleted after 5 weeks by log rotation.

162,162,botlabs-gg/yagpdb,Go,"# YAGPDB - Yet Another General Purpose Discord Bot

YAGPDB is a multifunctional, modular Discord bot. It is modular in the sense that for most things plugins exist -- However, some plugins may depend on other plugins.

## Plugins

* YouTube Feed
* Stream Announcements
* Server Stats
* Soundboard
* Reputation
* Reminders
* Reddit Feed
* Notifications
* Moderation
* Logs
* Custom Commands
* And More!

## Useful Links

* [Homepage](https://yagpdb.xyz)
* [Support Server](https://discord.gg/4udtcA5)
* [Documentation](https://docs.yagpdb.xyz)

## Selfhosting

There are two ways of selfhosting this bot: [standalone](#Hosting-Standalone), or [dockerized](#Hosting-Dockerized).

### General Bot Setup

Directions on creating an app and getting credentials may be found
[here](https://github.com/reactiflux/discord-irc/wiki/Creating-a-discord-bot-&-getting-a-token).
	@@ -37,129 +36,82 @@ via the Control Panel.

In addition, you will need to add the following urls to the bot's ""REDIRECT URI(S)"" configuration:

* <https://YourHostNameHere/confirm_login>
* <https://YourHostNameHere/manage>

### Hosting Dockerized

If you have docker-compose installed, that might be the fastest route of getting the bot up and running:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/botlabs-gg/yagpdb
cp yagpdb/yagpdb_docker/{app.example.env,app.env}
cp yagpdb/yagpdb_docker/{db.example.env,db.env}
```

Edit both env files accordingly. Make sure ports 80 and 443 are accessible on your network and that you have a proper image in `docker-compose.yml`:

```shell
docker-compose -f yagpdb/yagpdb_docker/docker-compose.yml up
```

Alternatively, you can run the bot behind a proxy:

```shell
docker network create proxy-tier
docker-compose -p proxy yagpdb/yagpdb_docker/docker-compose.proxy.yml up
docker-compose -f yagpdb/yagpdb_docker/docker-compose.proxied.yml up
```

During development, use the `docker-compose.dev.yml` file:

```shell
docker-compose -f yagpdb/yagpdb_docker/docker-compose.dev.yml up
```

### Hosting Standalone

#### Requirements

* Golang 1.16 or above
* PostgreSQL 9.6 or later
* Redis version 3.x or later

#### Setting Up

Configure Redis and Postgres with your desired settings.

In postgres, create a new user `yagpdb` and database `yagpdb` and grant that user access to that database.

Set up the environment variables with the credentials from the [general setup](#General-Bot-Setup). See the [sample env file](cmd/yagpdb/sampleenvfile) for a list of all enviroment variables.

Afterwards, run the build script located at `/cmd/yagpdb/build.sh` and  start the bot using `./yagpdb`:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/botlabs-gg/yagpdb
cd yagpdb/cmd/yagpdb
sh build.sh
./yagpdb -all
```

See `./yagpdb -help` for all usable run flags. The webserver listens by default on ports 5000 (HTTP) and 5001 (HTTPS).

## Databases

YAGPDB uses Redis for light data and caching, and postgresql for most configurations and heavy data, such as logs.

### Updating

Updating with v1 and higher should migrate schemas automatically, but you should always make backups.

Breaking changes can be found in breaking_changes.md, which should always be consulted before updating.

## Contributing

Please view the [contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) before submitting any contributions.

See bot/plugin for info about bot plugins, web/plugin for web plugins and feeds/plugin for feeds if you wanna make a new fully fledged plugin.

Expect web, bot and feed instances to be run separately.

For basic utility/fun commands, you can just jam them in stdcommands. Use the existing commands there as an example of how to add one.

Please check CONTRIBUTING.md for further details."

# Twitter Bot

[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/rhiever/TwitterFollowBot](https://badges.gitter.im/rhiever/TwitterFollowBot.svg)](https://gitter.im/rhiever/TwitterFollowBot?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

A Python bot that automates several actions on Twitter, such as following users and favoriting tweets.

## Notice: Repository is no longer being maintained

Twitter has started cracking down heavily on users who use bots like this one to follow users or favorite tweets en masse. For that reason, I am no longer developing this code repository but will leave it up for anyone who wants to use it as a code base for future projects. Please respect the [software license](https://github.com/rhiever/TwitterFollowBot/blob/master/LICENSE) if you use the code from this repository.

## Disclaimer

I hold no liability for what you do with this bot or what happens to you by using this bot. Abusing this bot *can* get you banned from Twitter, so make sure to read up on [proper usage](https://support.twitter.com/articles/76915-automation-rules-and-best-practices) of the Twitter API.

## Installation

You can install the Twitter Follow Bot using `pip`:

    pip install TwitterFollowBot

## Dependencies

You will need to install Python's [python-twitter](https://github.com/sixohsix/twitter/) library:

    pip install twitter

Although this library should be installed along with the Twitter Follow Bot if you used `pip`.

You will also need to create an app account on https://dev.twitter.com/apps

1. Sign in with your Twitter account
2. Create a new app account
3. Modify the settings for that app account to allow read & write
4. Generate a new OAuth token with those permissions

Following these steps will create 4 tokens that you will need to place in the configuration file discussed below.

## Usage

### Configuring the bot

Before running the bot, you must first set it up so it can connect to the Twitter API. Create a config.txt file and fill in the following information:

    OAUTH_TOKEN:
    OAUTH_SECRET:
    CONSUMER_KEY:
    CONSUMER_SECRET:
    TWITTER_HANDLE:
    ALREADY_FOLLOWED_FILE:already-followed.txt
    FOLLOWERS_FILE:followers.txt
    FOLLOWS_FILE:following.txt
    USERS_KEEP_FOLLOWING:
    USERS_KEEP_UNMUTED:
    USERS_KEEP_MUTED:
    FOLLOW_BACKOFF_MIN_SECONDS:10
    FOLLOW_BACKOFF_MAX_SECONDS:60
    
`OAUTH_TOKEN`, `OAUTH_SECRET`, `CONSUMER_KEY`, `CONSUMER_SECRET` are your API keys that you received from creating your app account. `TWITTER_HANDLE` is your Twitter name, case-sensitive.

You can change the `FILE` entries if you want to store that information in a specific location on your computer. By default, the files will be created in your current directory.

Add comma-separated Twitter user IDs to the `USERS_KEEP` entries to:

* `USERS_KEEP_FOLLOWING`: Keep following these users even if they don't follow you back.

* `USERS_KEEP_UNMUTED`: Keep these users unmuted (i.e., you receive a mobile notification when they tweet)

* `USERS_KEEP_MUTED`: Keep these users muted (i.e., you don't receive a mobile notification when they tweet)

For example:

    ...
    FOLLOWS_FILE:following.txt
    USERS_KEEP_FOLLOWING:1234,1235,1236
    USERS_KEEP_UNMUTED:
    ...
    
You can look up a users' Twitter ID [here](http://tweeterid.com/).

### Create an instance of the bot

To create an instance of the bot:

    from TwitterFollowBot import TwitterBot
    
    my_bot = TwitterBot()
    
By default, the bot will look for a configuration file called `config.txt` in your current directory.
    
If you want to use a different configuration file, pass the configuration file to the bot as follows:

    from TwitterFollowBot import TwitterBot
    
    my_bot = TwitterBot(""my-other-bot-config.txt"")
    
Note that this allows you to run multiple instances of the bot with different configurations, for example if you run multiple Twitter accounts:

    from TwitterFollowBot import TwitterBot
    
    my_bot = TwitterBot()
    my_other_bot = TwitterBot(""my-other-bot-config.txt"")

### Syncing your Twitter following locally

Due to Twitter API rate limiting, the bot must maintain a local cache of all of your followers so it doesn't use all of your API time looking up your followers. It is highly recommended to sync the bot's local cache daily:

    from TwitterFollowBot import TwitterBot
    
    my_bot = TwitterBot()
    my_bot.sync_follows()
    
The bot will create cache files where you specified in the configuration file.
    
**DO NOT** delete the cache files (""followers.txt"", ""follows.txt"", and ""already-followed.txt"" by default) unless you want to start the bot over with a fresh cache.

### Automating Twitter actions with the bot

This bot has several functions for programmatically interacting with Twitter:

#### Automatically follow any users that tweet something with a specific phrase

    from TwitterFollowBot import TwitterBot
    
    my_bot = TwitterBot()
    my_bot.auto_follow(""phrase"")
    
You can also search based on hashtags:

    from TwitterFollowBot import TwitterBot
    
    my_bot = TwitterBot()
    my_bot.auto_follow(""#hashtag"")
  
By default, the bot looks up the 100 most recent tweets. You can change this number with the `count` parameter:

    from TwitterFollowBot import TwitterBot
    
    my_bot = TwitterBot()
    my_bot.auto_follow(""phrase"", count=1000)
    
#### Automatically follow any users that have followed you

    from TwitterFollowBot import TwitterBot
    
    my_bot = TwitterBot()
    my_bot.auto_follow_followers()

#### Automatically follow any users that follow a user
    
    from TwitterFollowBot import TwitterBot
    
    my_bot = TwitterBot() 
    my_bot.auto_follow_followers_of_user(""jack"", count=1000)

#### Automatically favorite any tweets that have a specific phrase

    from TwitterFollowBot import TwitterBot
    
    my_bot = TwitterBot()
    my_bot.auto_fav(""phrase"", count=1000)
    
#### Automatically retweet any tweets that have a specific phrase

    from TwitterFollowBot import TwitterBot
    
    my_bot = TwitterBot()
    my_bot.auto_rt(""phrase"", count=1000)

#### Automatically unfollow any users that have not followed you back

    from TwitterFollowBot import TwitterBot
    
    my_bot = TwitterBot()
    my_bot.auto_unfollow_nonfollowers()
  
If there are certain users that you would like to not unfollow, add their user id to the USERS_KEEP_FOLLOWING list.

You will need to manually edit the code if you want to add special users that you will keep following even if they don't follow you back.

#### Automatically unfollow all users.

    from TwitterFollowBot import TwitterBot
    
    my_bot = TwitterBot()
    my_bot.auto_unfollow_all_followers()
  


#### Automatically mute all users that you have followed

    from TwitterFollowBot import TwitterBot
    
    my_bot = TwitterBot()
    my_bot.auto_mute_following()

You will need to manually edit the code if you want to add special users that you will not mute.

#### Automatically unmute everyone you have muted

    from TwitterFollowBot import TwitterBot
    
    my_bot = TwitterBot()
    my_bot.auto_unmute()
    
You will need to manually edit the code if you want to add special users that will remain muted. 

#### Post a tweet on twitter

    from TwitterFollowBot import TwitterBot
    
    my_bot = TwitterBot()
    my_bot.send_tweet(""Hello world!"")

#### Automatically add users tweeting about something to one of your list

    from TwitterFollowBot import TwitterBot
    
    my_bot = TwitterBot()
    my_bot.auto_add_to_list(""#TwitterBot"", ""twitterbot-list"", count=10)
    
In the example above, the bot will try to add 10 users to the twitterbot-list that are tweeting #TwitterBot.

Remember that the max number of users in a list is 5000.
    
## Have questions? Need help with the bot?

If you're having issues with or have questions about the bot, [file an issue](https://github.com/rhiever/TwitterFollowBot/issues) in this repository so one of the project managers can get back to you. **Please [check the existing (and closed) issues](https://github.com/rhiever/TwitterFollowBot/issues?q=is%3Aissue) to make sure your issue hasn't already been addressed.**

You should be able to make the course materials by typing

make html (output in ./html directory)

or

make pdf (output in csbu.pdf)

Included for simplicity are the docbook dtds, xsl stylesheets and fop
distribution.  You need some other things for this to work out of the
box.  If you have the Debian packages

* java (1.8 ... 1.7 seems to have some issues with saxon; see
    https://sourceforge.net/p/docbook/bugs/1373/ )
* libxml2-utils
* jing
* transfig (for fig2dev)

you will probably be ok.

`movie_kb.1k.p` --- 94% success rate (for `user_goals_first_turn_template_subsets.v1.p`)<br/>
`movie_kb.v2.p` --- 36% success rate (for `user_goals_first_turn_template_subsets.v1.p`)

* User Goals<br/>
`user_goals_first_turn_template.v2.p` --- user goals extracted from the first user turn<br/>
`user_goals_first_turn_template.part.movie.v1.p` --- a subset of user goals [Please use this one, the upper bound success rate on movie_kb.1k.json is 0.9765.]

* NLG Rule Template<br/>
`dia_act_nl_pairs.v6.json` --- some predefined NLG rule templates for both User simulator and Agent.

## Evaluation
To evaluate the performance of agents, three metrics are available: success rate, average reward, average turns. Here we show the learning curve with success rate.

1. Plotting Learning Curve
``` python draw_learning_curve.py --result_file ./deep_dialog/checkpoints/rl_agent/noe2e/agt_9_performance_records.json```
2. Pull out the numbers and draw the curves in Excel

Should you be forking this repo then do not forget to star it - <img alt=""GitHub Repo stars"" src=""https://img.shields.io/github/stars/animekaizoku/saitamarobot?color=white&label=%F0%9F%8C%9F%20star"">

## Note:
Future updates on the code have been moved to a seperate repository that is now private and away from the toxic, ungrateful and cancerous marie community, we believe we have burned out blood enough for the leecher community that just wants to take, debate and laugh while bringing nothing progressive back to the repository, in lieu of the same we are now closed sourced. 

If you believe this is ""illegal or is violating the GPLv3"" license, I request you come to @OnePunchSupport on telegram WITH your lawyer to discuss the same.
Good day! 

## Support and Help:
We do not provide any support or help or take any questions or queries around this repo, if you want to deploy it you are on your own, learn to read or ask in some python dev group or stalkoverflow, the internet is your learning ground - but do NOT come our support group asking any help around the code or the repo, you will get immediately banned and just cussed at. 

We did not run this bot or this repo to feed every entititled user who demands our dedicated time and attention, we are tired of it and the horrible community around kangs.

# Introduction
Policy as Code Bot (PacBot) is a platform for continuous compliance monitoring, compliance reporting and security automation for the cloud. In PacBot, security and compliance policies are implemented as code. All resources discovered by PacBot are evaluated against these policies to gauge policy conformance. The PacBot auto-fix framework provides the ability to automatically respond to policy violations by taking predefined actions. PacBot packs in powerful visualization features, giving a simplified view of compliance and making it easy to analyze and remediate policy violations. PacBot is more than a tool to manage cloud misconfiguration, it is a generic platform that can be used to do continuous compliance monitoring and reporting for any domain.

## More Than Cloud Compliance Assessment
PacBot's plugin-based data ingestion architecture allows ingesting data from multiple sources. We have built plugins to pull data from Qualys Vulnerability Assessment Platform, Bitbucket, TrendMicro Deep Security, Tripwire, Venafi Certificate Management, Redhat Satellite, Spacewalk, Active Directory and several other custom-built internal solutions. We are working to open source these plugins and other tools as well. You could write rules based on data collected by these plugins to get a complete picture of your ecosystem and not just cloud misconfigurations. For example, within T-Mobile we have implemented a policy to mark all EC2 instances having one or more severity 5 (CVSS score > 7) vulnerabilities as non-compliant.

## Quick Demo

## How Does It Work?
**Assess -> Report -> Remediate -> Repeat**

Assess -> Report -> Remediate -> Repeat is PacBot's philosophy. PacBot discovers resources and assesses them against the policies implemented as code. All policy violations are recorded as an issue. Whenever an Auto-Fix hook is available with the policies, those auto-fixes are executed when the resources fail the evaluation. Policy violations cannot be closed manually, the issue has to be fixed at the source and PacBot will mark it closed in the next scan. Exceptions can be added to policy violations. Sticky exceptions (Exception based on resource attribute matching criteria) can be added to exempt similar resources that may be created in future.


PacBot's Asset Groups are a powerful way to visualize compliance. Asset Groups are created by defining one or more target resource's attribute matching criteria. For example, you could create an Asset Group of all running assets by defining criteria to match all EC2 instances with attribute instancestate.name=running. Any new EC2 instance launched after the creation of the Asset Group will be automatically included in the group. In PacBot UI you can select the scope of the portal to a specific asset group. All the data points shown in the PacBot portal will be confined to the selected Asset Group. Teams using cloud can set the scope of the portal to their application or org and focus only on their policy violations. This reduces noise and provides a clear picture to cloud users. At T-Mobile, we create an Asset Groups per stakeholder, per application, per AWS account, per Environment etc.

Asset groups can also be used to define the scope of rule executions as well. PacBot policies are implemented as one or more rules. These rules can be configured to run against all resources or a specific Asset Group. The rules will evaluate all resources in the asset group configured as the scope for the rule. This provides an opportunity to write policies which are very specific to an application or org. For example, some teams would like to enforce additional tagging standards apart from the global standards set for all of the cloud. They can implement such policies with custom rules and configure these rules to run only on their assets.

rustup update stable

# Option 1 - Download from releases and install
curl -LO https://github.com/ClementTsang/bottom/archive/0.6.8.tar.gz
tar -xzvf 0.6.8.tar.gz
cargo install --path .

# Option 2 - Clone from master and install manually
git clone https://github.com/ClementTsang/bottom
cd bottom
cargo install --path .

# Option 3 - Clone and install directly from the repo all via Cargo
cargo install --git https://github.com/ClementTsang/bottom
```

### Binaries

You can also try to use the generated release binaries and manually install on your system:

- [Latest stable release](https://github.com/ClementTsang/bottom/releases/latest), generated off of the release branch
- [Latest nightly release](https://github.com/ClementTsang/bottom/releases/tag/nightly), generated daily off of the master branch at 00:00 UTC

#### Auto-completion

The release binaries are packaged with shell auto-completion files for bash, fish, zsh, and Powershell. To install them:

- For bash, move `btm.bash` to `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/bash_completion or /etc/bash_completion.d/`.
- For fish, move `btm.fish` to `$HOME/.config/fish/completions/`.
- For zsh, move `_btm` to one of your `$fpath` directories.
- For PowerShell, add `. _btm.ps1` to your PowerShell
  [profile](<https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions//bb613488(v=vs.85)>).

## Usage

You can run bottom using `btm`.

- For help on flags, use `btm -h` for a quick overview or `btm --help` for more details.
- For info on key and mouse bindings, press `?` inside bottom or refer to the [documentation](https://clementtsang.github.io/bottom/nightly/).

You can find more information on usage in the [documentation](https://clementtsang.github.io/bottom/nightly/).

## Thanks

- This project is very much inspired by [gotop](https://github.com/xxxserxxx/gotop),
  [gtop](https://github.com/aksakalli/gtop), and [htop](https://github.com/htop-dev/htop/).

- This application was written with many, _many_ libraries, and built on the
  work of many talented people. This application would be impossible without their
  work. I used to thank them all individually but the list got too large...

- And of course, another round of thanks to all contributors and package maintainers!

## System dependencies

- [Node.js LTS or latest](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [Java 13](https://www.azul.com/downloads/?package=jdk#download-openjdk) (other versions have some issues with Lavalink)

### Installing the Node.js dependencies

After cloning the repository, navigate to the project's folder and run the command `npm i` to install all Node.js module dependencies.

## Setup

Create an [application.yml](https://github.com/freyacodes/lavalink/blob/master/LavalinkServer/application.yml.example) in the root directory of the project.

Download the latest Lavalink jar from [here](https://github.com/Cog-Creators/Lavalink-Jars/releases) and place it in the project's root directory (same directory as application.yml).

**Before running ```node index.js```, make sure to open a separate terminal in the root directory and run ```java -jar LavaLink.jar```**

Create a `config.json` file inside the 'src' directory with the following tokens:

### Minimum settings

This is the minimum amount of settings that need to be set for the core part (music) of the bot to work.

**Generate spotify client id and secret [here](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications)**

**If you're running the bot using Docker, set lava_host's value to ""lavalink"" in config.json and in application.yml at line 3**

```json
{
  ""client_id"": ""the-bots-client-id"",
  ""client_secret"": ""the-bots-client-secret"",
  ""token"": ""Your-Bot-Token"",
  ""lava_host"": ""0.0.0.0"",
  ""lava_pass"": ""youshallnotpass"",
  ""lava_port"": 2333,
  ""lava_secure"": false,
  ""invite_url"": ""discord-bot-invite"",
  ""spotify_client_id"": ""get-it-from-spotify-dev"",
  ""spotify_client_secret"": ""get-it-from-spotify-dev""
}
```

### Full settings

For full command support, including lyrics, GIFs, news, and others, - (which some of them are part of [Features to be added back](https://github.com/galnir/Master-Bot/issues/667)) - All of the following settings need to be added. You can also choose to add only the ones for the functionalities you want.

```json
{
  ""invite"": ""false"",
  ""geniusLyricsAPI"": ""genius-api-key"",
  ""tenorAPI"": ""tenor-API-key"",
  ""newsAPI"": ""news-api-key"",
  ""rawgAPI"": ""rawg-api-key""
}
```

NOTE: When setting `""invite"": true`, remember to enable the Public Bot option in the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/).

174,174,flashbots/simple-arbitrage,TypeScript,"simple-arbitrage
================
This repository contains a simple, mechanical system for discovering, evaluating, rating, and submitting arbitrage opportunities to the Flashbots bundle endpoint. This script is very unlikely to be profitable, as many users have access to it, and it is targeting well-known Ethereum opportunities.

We hope you will use this repository as an example of how to integrate Flashbots into your own Flashbot searcher (bot). For more information, see the [Flashbots Searcher FAQ](https://docs.flashbots.net/flashbots-auction/searchers/faq)

Environment Variables
=====================
- **ETHEREUM_RPC_URL** - Ethereum RPC endpoint. Can not be the same as FLASHBOTS_RPC_URL
- **PRIVATE_KEY** - Private key for the Ethereum EOA that will be submitting Flashbots Ethereum transactions
- **FLASHBOTS_RELAY_SIGNING_KEY** _[Optional, default: random]_ - Flashbots submissions require an Ethereum private key to sign transaction payloads. This newly-created account does not need to hold any funds or correlate to any on-chain activity, it just needs to be used across multiple Flashbots RPC requests to identify requests related to same searcher. Please see https://docs.flashbots.net/flashbots-auction/searchers/faq#do-i-need-authentication-to-access-the-flashbots-relay
- **HEALTHCHECK_URL** _[Optional]_ - Health check URL, hit only after successfully submitting a bundle.
- **MINER_REWARD_PERCENTAGE** _[Optional, default 80]_ - 0 -> 100, what percentage of overall profitability to send to miner.

Usage
======================
1. Generate a new bot wallet address and extract the private key into a raw 32-byte format.
2. Deploy the included BundleExecutor.sol to Ethereum, from a secured account, with the address of the newly created wallet as the constructor argument
3. Transfer WETH to the newly deployed BundleExecutor

_It is important to keep both the bot wallet private key and bundleExecutor owner private key secure. The bot wallet attempts to not lose WETH inside an arbitrage, but a malicious user would be able to drain the contract._

```
$ npm install
$ PRIVATE_KEY=__PRIVATE_KEY_FROM_ABOVE__ \
    BUNDLE_EXECUTOR_ADDRESS=__DEPLOYED_ADDRESS_FROM_ABOVE__ \
    FLASHBOTS_RELAY_SIGNING_KEY=__RANDOM_ETHEREUM_PRIVATE_KEY__ \
      npm run start
```

### Creating your bot

```java
TelegramBot bot = new TelegramBot(""BOT_TOKEN"");
```
Network operations based on [OkHttp](https://github.com/square/okhttp) library.  
You can build bot with custom OkHttpClient, for specific timeouts or interceptors.
```java
TelegramBot bot = new TelegramBot.Builder(""BOT_TOKEN"").okHttpClient(client).build();
```

### Making requests

Synchronous
```java
BaseResponse response = bot.execute(request);
```

Asynchronous
```java
bot.execute(request, new Callback() {
    @Override
    public void onResponse(BaseRequest request, BaseResponse response) {
    
    }
    @Override
    public void onFailure(BaseRequest request, IOException e) {
    
    }
});
```

Request [in response to update](https://core.telegram.org/bots/faq#how-can-i-make-requests-in-response-to-updates)
```java
String response = request.toWebhookResponse();
```

### Getting updates

You can use **getUpdates** request, parse incoming **Webhook** request, or set listener to receive updates.  
Update object just copies Telegram's response.

```java
class Update {
    Integer updateId();
    Message message();
    Message editedMessage();
    InlineQuery inlineQuery();
    ChosenInlineResult chosenInlineResult();
    CallbackQuery callbackQuery();
}
```

#### Get updates

Building request
```java
GetUpdates getUpdates = new GetUpdates().limit(100).offset(0).timeout(0);
```

The getUpdates method returns the earliest 100 unconfirmed updates. To confirm an update, use the offset parameter when calling getUpdates like this:
`offset = updateId of last processed update + 1`  
All updates with updateId less than offset will be marked as confirmed on the server and will no longer be returned.

Executing
```java
// sync
GetUpdatesResponse updatesResponse = bot.execute(getUpdates);
List<Update> updates = updatesResponse.updates();
...
Message message = update.message()


// async
bot.execute(getUpdates, new Callback<GetUpdates, GetUpdatesResponse>() {
    @Override
    public void onResponse(GetUpdates request, GetUpdatesResponse response) {
        List<Update> updates = response.updates();
    }
    
    @Override
    public void onFailure(GetUpdates request, IOException e) {
    
    }
});
```

#### Webhook

Building request
```java
SetWebhook request = new SetWebhook()
       .url(""url"")
       .certificate(new byte[]{}) // byte[]
       .certificate(new File(""path"")); // or file 
```

Executing
```java
// sync
BaseResponse response = bot.execute(request);
boolean ok = response.isOk();

// async
bot.execute(request, new Callback<SetWebhook, BaseResponse>() {
    @Override
    public void onResponse(SetWebhook request, BaseResponse response) {
    
    }
    @Override
    public void onFailure(SetWebhook request, IOException e) {
        
    }
});
```

Using Webhook you can parse request to Update
```java
Update update = BotUtils.parseUpdate(stringRequest); // from String
Update update = BotUtils.parseUpdate(reader); // or from java.io.Reader

Message message = update.message();
``` 

#### Updates Listener

You can set listener to receiving incoming updates as if using Webhook.  
This will trigger executing getUpdates requests in a loop.

```java
bot.setUpdatesListener(new UpdatesListener() {
    @Override
    public int process(List<Update> updates) {

        // process updates

        return UpdatesListener.CONFIRMED_UPDATES_ALL;
    }
});
```

Listener should return id of the last processed (confirmed) update.  
To confirm all updates return `UpdatesListener.CONFIRMED_UPDATES_ALL`, this should be enough in most cases.  
To not confirm any updates return `UpdatesListener.CONFIRMED_UPDATES_NONE`, these updates will be redelivered.  
To set specific update as last confirmed just return required updateId.

To stop receiving updates
```java
bot.removeGetUpdatesListener();
```

### Available types

All types have the same name as original ones.  
Type's fields are methods in lowerCamelCase.

Types used in responses **(Update, Message, User, Document...)** are in `com.pengrad.telegrambot.model` package. 

Types used in requests **(Keyboard, InlineQueryResult, ParseMode, InputMessageContent...)** are in `com.pengrad.telegrambot.model.request` package.  
When creating request's type required params should be passed in constructor, optional params can be added in chains.

```

Answer pre-checkout query
```java

BaseResponse response = bot.execute(answerPreCheckoutQuery);

// answer with error
AnswerPreCheckoutQuery answerCheckout = new AnswerPreCheckoutQuery(id, ""Sorry, item not available"");
BaseResponse response = bot.execute(answerPreCheckoutQuery);
```

### Telegram Passport

When the user confirms your request by pressing the ‘Authorize’ button, the Bot API sends an Update with the field passport_data to the bot that contains encrypted Telegram Passport data. [Telegram Passport Manual](https://core.telegram.org/passport#receiving-information)

#### Receiving information 
You can get encrypted Passport data from Update (via UpdatesListener or Webhook)
```java
PassportData passportData = update.message().passportData();
```
PassportData contains array of `EncryptedPassportElement` and `EncryptedCredentials`.  
You need to decrypt `Credentials` using private key (public key you uploaded to `@BotFather`)
```java
String privateKey = ""..."";
EncryptedCredentials encryptedCredentials = passportData.credentials();
Credentials credentials = encryptedCredentials.decrypt(privateKey);
```
These `Credentials` can be used to decrypt encrypted data in `EncryptedPassportElement`.
```java
EncryptedPassportElement[] encryptedPassportElements = passportData.data();
for (EncryptedPassportElement element : encryptedPassportElements) {
    DecryptedData decryptedData = element.decryptData(credentials);
    // DecryptedData can be cast to specific type by checking instanceOf 
    if (decryptedData instanceof PersonalDetails) {
        PersonalDetails personalDetails = (PersonalDetails) decryptedData;
    }
    // Or by checking type of passport element
    if (element.type() == EncryptedPassportElement.Type.address) {
        ResidentialAddress address = (ResidentialAddress) decryptedData;
    }
}
```
`EncryptedPassportElement` also contains array of `PassportFile` (file uploaded to Telegram Passport).  
You need to download them 1 by 1 and decrypt content.  
This library supports downloading and decryption, returns decrypted byte[]
```java
EncryptedPassportElement element = ...

// Combine all files 
List<PassportFile> files = new ArrayList<PassportFile>();
files.add(element.frontSide());
files.add(element.reverseSide());
files.add(element.selfie());
if (element.files() != null) {
    files.addAll(Arrays.asList(element.files()));
}
if (element.translation() != null) {
    files.addAll(Arrays.asList(element.translation()));
}

// Decrypt
for (PassportFile file : files) {
    if (file == null) continue;
    byte[] data = element.decryptFile(file, credentials, bot); // GetFile request and decrypt content
    // save to file if needed
    new FileOutputStream(""files/"" + element.type()).write(data);
}
```

#### Set Passport data errors
``` java
SetPassportDataErrors setPassportDataErrors = new SetPassportDataErrors(chatId,
        new PassportElementErrorDataField(""personal_details"", ""first_name"", ""dataHash"",
                ""Please enter a valid First name""),
        new PassportElementErrorSelfie(""driver_license"", ""fileHash"",
                ""Can't see your face on photo"")
);
bot.execute(setPassportDataErrors);
```

### Games

Send game
```java
SendResponse response = bot.execute(new SendGame(chatId, ""my_super_game""));
```

Set game score
```java
BaseResponse response = bot.execute(new SetGameScore(userId, score, chatId, messageId));
```

Get game high scores
```java
GetGameHighScoresResponse response = bot.execute(new GetGameHighScores(userId, chatId, messageId));
GameHighScore[] scores = response.result();
```

# Welcome

## Introduction

This guide makes a best effort attempt at humanizing the use of the Discord.js library, in its current version 13 iteration. It is maintained by York\#0001 and Discordaholic\#0001 \(""Evie.Codes""\), with the help of many precious contributors that enable us to keep updating and enhancing this guide.

It was born out of necessity - the first version of this guide for Discord.js version 7, more than 5 years ago, was the first of its kind because I \(Evie\) could not find any such beginner's guide and the documentation was \(and still is\) unfathomably difficult to navigate for anyone without a sufficiently advanced knowledge of JavaScript concepts.

In this guide we make every effort to _teach_ you how to use the library and how to extend it with your own code. We do, however expect you to have a basic understanding of JavaScript before attempting to write bots. Discord.js \(and other discord libraries\) require some median-to-advanced concepts that might be hard to grasp for anyone that doesn't have a good footing with the language.

## Get Support

If you have any questions after reading this guide, please don't hesitate to join us on our Discord server, ""An Idiot's Guide"". The link is located at the top of this page. If you wish to consult with the discord.js developers and official community, the Discord.js official discord is right next to ours, still at the top of the page!

# Installation

Ce bot est écrit pour fonctionner avec node.js. Allez voir : https://nodejs.org/en/download/

Une fois NodeJS installé, exécutez `npm install` depuis le répertoire du bot, cela devrait installer tous les fichiers nécessaires (packages npm). Si cette commande affiche des erreurs, le bot ne fonctionnera pas!



## Utilisateur windows
Notez que vous devez avoir un compileur C et Python dans le répertoire pour que
`npm install` fonctionne. Le bot a été testé sur Windows avec Visual Studio 2015 Community et Python 2.7, à l'exception de `!pullanddeploy`.

* [Visual Studio Community 2015](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/visual-studio-community-vs.aspx)
* [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

[Tuck 64 a fait une vidéo afin d'illustrer la procédure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-82S2jFOII)

## RSS
Vous pouvez créer un fichier rss.json en ajoutant des flux rss sous forme de commande. Allez voir rss.json.example pour plus de détails.

## Instructions spéciales pour paramétrer l'API google search et l'API youtube :

(merci à @SchwererKonigstiger)

1) Créez une recherche personnalisée sur : https://cse.google.com/cse/create/new

2) Laissez le premier champ vide, et saisissez ce que vous souhaitez pour le nom du moteur de recherche.

3) Cliquez sur ""Advanced Options"" et ensuite sur ImageObject.

4) C'est créé.

5) Sur la nouvelle page, autorisez la recherche d'image dans le menu.

6) Cliquez ensuite sur ""Search engine ID"" sous l'en-tête des détails.

7) Copiez ceci dans le fichier auth.json, dans la partie ""google_custom_search"".

Vérifiez que vous possédiez bien la clé d'API Google server, qui est située dans la partie ""youtube_api_key"", ou la recherche va échouer.

# Lancement
Avant de lancer le bot pour la première fois, vous devez créer un fichier `auth.json`. Un token ou une adresse mail avec mot de passe d'un compte discord sont requis. Les autres informations d'identification ne sont pas requises pour que le bot s'exécute, mais elles sont vivement recommandées car les commandes qui en dépendent risquent de mal fonctionner. Voir `auth.json.example`.

Pour lancer le bot, exécuter ceci :
`node discord_bot.js`.

# Mis à jour
Si vous mettez à jour le bot, exécutez `npm update` avant de le lancer à nouveau. Si vous avez des erreurs, essayez de supprimer le dossier node_modules et exécutez de nouveau
`npm install`. Allez à [Installation](#Installation).

# A Faire:
Paramétrer le bot !

# Help
Veuillez vérifier la page des bugs GitHub de ce projet. Nous recevons beaucoup de questions similaires, et il est probable que votre problème ait déjà été résolu.

182,182,alavers/smooch-bot-example,JavaScript,"# SmoochBot Examples

A set of example chat bots built on [smooch/smooch-bot](https://github.com/smooch/smooch-bot).

Before you get started with any of these samples, from this directory you should:

```
$ npm install
```

All of these samples use the same scipt defined in `script.js`. Feel free to play around with it as you go.

## Console Example (/console)

This is the simplest sample that runs via the command line and uses an in-memory store to track state.

![console](/img/console.gif)

To run it, simply:

```
$ node console
```

And start chatting with your bot on the command line.

## Heroku Example (/heroku)

This is an Express app that uses the Smooch web widget to provide the chat interface. The app makes use of `SmoochApiStore` and `SmoochApiBot` to persist conversation state and user properties via Smooch.

![heroku](/img/heroku.gif)

To deploy your own:

1. First, sign up for a free account at [smooch.io](https://app.smooch.io/signup)

1. With a new Smooch app created, go to the settings tab and take note of your App Token. Also, generate a new Secret Key, and take note of the key ID and secret.

    ![settings](/img/settings.png)

1. Deploy your app to Heroku using the button below. You'll need to specify your app token, key ID, and secret in the app's `SMOOCH_APP_TOKEN`, `SMOOCH_KEY_ID`, and `SMOOCH_SECRET` config settings.

    [![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/smooch/smooch-bot-example)

1. Your app should now be running on Heroku but you're not quite done yet. Take note of the URL where your heroku app is running, for example `https://foo-bar-4242.herokuapp.com`. You'll need to specify this in your heroku app `SERVICE_URL` config variable. You can do this in the Heroku control panel under *Settings* > *Config Variables*, or if you have the [Heroku Toolbelt](https://toolbelt.heroku.com/) installed you can do it like so:

        $ heroku config:set SERVICE_URL=https://foo-bar-4242.herokuapp.com -a foo-bar-4242

1. You should be all set. Open your Heroku app and start chatting with your new bot!

1. **Bonus:** Open the Smooch [control panel](https://app.smooch.io) and add more integrations. You can add new user channels like Twilio SMS, or you can add Slack or HipChat which will let you join in on the conversation along side your bot. Pretty neat!

# Troubleshooting your bot

Is your bot misbehaving? Not working? Here are some steps you can follow to figure out what's going wrong.

**Warning:** command line instructions incoming. You may not be accustomed to using the command line but don't worry, it's much easier than you think.


## Check your bot's logs on heroku

If there's a bug in your code, checking the heroku logs is the best way to figure out what's going wrong. Here's how:

1. Install the heroku toolbelt: https://toolbelt.heroku.com/ These are power tools that let you do a lot more than what Heroku dashboard alone allows.

2. Next, open your preferred terminal app. On OSX the default Terminal app will work fine here.

3. Log in to the heroku toolbelt with the following command:

        heroku login

    If the command heroku isn't found, try restarting your terminal app. Once logged in you should be able to list all of your heroku apps like so:

        heroku apps

    which should give you something like this:

        $ heroku apps
        === My Apps
        your-app

4. Now you can check the logs of your heroku app like so:

        heroku logs -a your-app

    This will give you a dump of your most recent app logs. They will look something like the following. Can you spot the error below?

    Did you notice the `SyntaxError` part? It looks like there's a problem in my script.json. If I inspect that file in github I'll see that indeed, I have a stray comma at the end if the second to last line.

    ![image](/img/script-error.png)

    After I remove that comma and redeploy, everything will return to normal.

## How do I deploy my fixes to Heroku?

Great question! Now that you've found your bug and fixed it, you want to redeploy your app. With Heroku you can trigger a deployment using git. Without going into detail, git is a code versioning system it's where github gets its name. Git is the software, github.com is a separate company that hosts git code repositories. If you're using a Mac you should already have git installed. Although git is a very complex tool, it's worth [learning if you're eager](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/what-is-git), but for this guide's purposes we'll be using only the most basic concepts of git, `pull`ing changes from a remote github repository, `commit`ing changes, and then `push`ing those changes out to a remote repository.

1. To deploy using git you first have to download a copy of your heroku app's code, like so:

        git clone https://github.com/your-github-username/your-app

    Note that git will prompt you to enter your github credentials.

2. This will create a new git copy of your code in a new folder. You can go into that folder like so:

        cd your-app

3. Now you can use the heroku toolbelt to link this git copy up to your heroku app with the following command:

        heroku git:remote -a your-app

4. Once that's done, you can now deploy to heroku directly from this directory. If you've made any fixes on github directly, be sure to sync them here like so:

        git pull origin master
        git push heroku master

5. You can also make changes to your local copy of the code. To do this, edit whatever file you wish in your preferred text editor, and then commit and push them up to github. You'll add a commit message, which is a short sentence decribing what you changed.

        git commit -a -m 'Your commit message'
        git push origin master

    Then, you can deploy those changes to heroku in the same way:

        git push heroku master

Pixelbot for Diablo 2 Resurrected. This project is for informational and educational purposes only and is not meant for online usage. Feel free to dig around, add stuff, make PRs, or ask questions should you get stuck!

[**Download here**](https://github.com/aeon0/botty/releases) and got to have a [**Discord**](https://discord.gg/Jf3J8cuXWg) nowadays I guess :man_shrugging:

## Getting started & Prequists
- D2r needs to be in English Language,
- Botty currently works with 720p D2r window (will be adjusted automatically on auto settings)

### 1) Graphics and Gameplay Settings

All settings will automatically be set when you execute `main.exe` and press the hotkey for ""Adjust D2R settings"" (default f9). It is not a 100% thing, in rare cases you might still have to fiddle around with your brightness. I suggest using the ""Graphic Debugger"" to verify your settings.
**Note**: Make sure that no other external programs adapt your graphics settings (HDR, Geforce Experience, etc.)

### 2) Supported builds

Check the documentation for **param.ini** further down. Different Sorc builds, Hammardin, Barb, Trapsin are already implemented to different extents. It is quite straightforward to implement new classes. Give it a go if you like!

### 3) Start Location

Open up D2R and wait till you are at the hero selection screen. Make sure the char you running with is selected and will be in any of Act 3, 4 or 5 in the respective difficulty you set in the **param.ini** once the bot starts the game.

### 4) Start Botty

You can either run from python. Follow [development.md](development.md) for that. Or you download the a prebuilt release [here](https://github.com/aeon0/botty/releases) (the .rar file!). Start `main.exe` in the botty folder. Focus your D2R window and press the start key (default f11). You can always force stop botty with f12. Note: Botty will use the /nopickup command in the first game to avoid pickup up trash while traversing. This command will only allow item pickup when ""show items"" is active.

## Graphic Debugger

To check if you graphic settings are good and if the bot would pick up items there is a **Graphic Debugger Mode**. Start botty and press F10 (Default key). This will open up a (mostly black) window. Start a game in D2R and go to A5. You should see some templates with blue circles detected and scores printed out to the console. To check item finding, throw some items of different types on the ground. The debug window should show the item names with black background. If you throw an item on the ground that should be picked up, it will have a red circle. The console will print out the scores for each item that would be picked up. Scores should be well above 0.9 for these items.</br>
<img src=""assets/docs/graphic_debugger.png"" width=""900"">

## Development

Check out the [development.md](development.md) docu for infos on how to build from source and details of the project structure and code.

## param.ini

All botty configuration files are located in the __config__ folder. To ease the switch to new botty versions, you can also overwrite any of the .ini fields in a **custom.ini** file. When a new version of botty is released you just copy the file to the new version without having to port all your **param.ini** changes to the new version. Example:

```ini
; custom.ini - overwrites 3 params in the param.ini
[general]
name=MyCustomName

[routes]
run_pindle=1
run_shenk=0

Alternative sites can be found [here](https://t.me/TeleBotHelpChat/272145), incase the top one doesn't work.

### The Normal Way

Simply clone the repository and run the main file:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/xditya/TeleBot
cd TeleBot
virtualenv -p /usr/bin/python3 venv
. ./venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
# <Create local_config.py with variables as given below>
python3 -m telebot
```

An example `local_config.py` file could be:

**Not All of the variables are mandatory**

__The Userbot should work by setting only the first two variables__

```python3
from heroku_config import Var

class Development(Var):
  APP_ID = 6
  API_HASH = ""eb06d4abfb49dc3eeb1aeb98ae0f581e""
```

**Heroku Configuration**
Simply just leave the Config as it is.

**Local Configuration**
Check [Line 111](https://github.com/Total-Noob-69/X-tra-Telegram/blob/master/userbot/uniborgConfig.py#L111) and start adding your vars there.
Fortunately there are no Mandatory vars for the UniBorg Support Config.

## Mandatory Vars

- Only two of the environment variables are mandatory.
- This is because of `telethon.errors.rpc_error_list.ApiIdPublishedFloodError`
    - `APP_ID`:   You can get this value from https://my.telegram.org
    - `API_HASH`:   You can get this value from https://my.telegram.org
- The userbot will not work without setting the mandatory vars.

# Disclaimer

/**
    	Improper use may lead to ban.
    	I am not responsible if you misuse this bot.

	If you spammed and got reported again and again, 
	and, at last got your account banned, and you
	point your fingers at me, I'll be rolling on the floor laughing at you.

A Node client for the [Facebook Messenger Platform](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform).

Requires Node >=4.0.0.

## Installation

```bash
npm install messenger-bot
```

## Example

See more examples in [the examples folder.](https://github.com/remixz/messenger-bot/tree/master/example)

Run this example in the cloud: [![Nitrous Quickstart](https://nitrous-image-icons.s3.amazonaws.com/quickstart.svg)](https://www.nitrous.io/quickstart)
* Setup `PAGE_TOKEN`, `VERIFY_TOKEN`, `APP_SECRET` and start the example by `Run > Start Messenger Echo Bot`.
* Your Webhook URL is available at `Preview > 3000` in the IDE.

```js
const http = require('http')
const Bot = require('messenger-bot')

let bot = new Bot({
  token: 'PAGE_TOKEN',
  verify: 'VERIFY_TOKEN',
  app_secret: 'APP_SECRET'
})

bot.on('error', (err) => {
  console.log(err.message)
})

bot.on('message', (payload, reply) => {
  let text = payload.message.text

  bot.getProfile(payload.sender.id, (err, profile) => {
    if (err) throw err

    reply({ text }, (err) => {
      if (err) throw err

      console.log(`Echoed back to ${profile.first_name} ${profile.last_name}: ${text}`)
    })
  })
})

http.createServer(bot.middleware()).listen(3000)
console.log('Echo bot server running at port 3000.')
```

## Usage

### Functions

#### `let bot = new Bot(opts)`

Returns a new Bot instance.

`opts` - Object

* `token` - String: Your Page Access Token, found in your App settings. Required.
* `verify` - String: A verification token for the first-time setup of your webhook. Optional, but will be required by Facebook when you first set up your webhook.
* `app_secret` - String: Your App Secret token used for message integrity check. If specified, every POST request  will be tested for spoofing. Optional.

#### `bot.middleware()`

The main middleware for your bot's webhook. Returns a function. Usage:

```js
const http = require('http')
const Bot = require('messenger-bot')

let bot = new Bot({
  token: 'PAGE_TOKEN',
  verify: 'VERIFY_TOKEN'
})

http.createServer(bot.middleware()).listen(3000)
```

As well, it mounts `/_status`, which will return `{""status"": ""ok""}` if the middleware is running. If `verify` is specified in the bot options, it will mount a handler for `GET` requests that verifies the webhook.

#### `bot.sendMessage(recipient, payload, [callback], [messagingType], [tag])`

Sends a message with the `payload` to the target `recipient`, and calls the callback if any. Returns a promise. See [Send API](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/send-api-reference#request).

* `recipient` - Number: The Facebook ID of the intended recipient.
* `payload` - Object: The message payload. Should follow the [Send API format](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/send-api-reference).
* `callback` - (Optional) Function: Called with `(err, info)` once the request has completed. `err` contains an error, if any, and `info` contains the response from Facebook, usually with the new message's ID.
* `messagingType` - (Optional) String: The message type. [Supported Messaging Type](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/send-messages#messaging_types).
* `tag` - (Optional) String: The tag's message. [Supported Tags](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/send-messages/message-tags#supported_tags).

#### `bot.getAttachmentUploadId(url, is_reusable, type, [callback])`

Sends the media to the Attachment Upload API and calls the callback if the upload is successful, including the `attachment_id`. See [Attachment Upload API](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/reference/attachment-upload-api).

* `url` - String: Link where can be fetched the media.
* `is_reusable` - Boolean: Defined if the saved asset will be sendable to other message recipients.
* `type` - String: The type of media. Can be one of: `image`, `video`, `audio`, `file`.
* `callback` - (Optional) Function: Called with `(err, info)` once the request has completed. `err` contains an error, if any, and `info` contains the response from Facebook, usually with the media's ID.

#### `bot.sendSenderAction(recipient, senderAction, [callback])`

Sends the sender action `senderAction` to the target `recipient`, and calls the callback if any. Returns a promise.

* `recipient` - Number: The Facebook ID of the intended recipient.
* `senderAction` - String: The sender action to execute. Can be one of: `typing_on`, 'typing_off', 'mark_seen'. See the [Sender Actions API reference](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/send-api-reference/sender-actions) for more information.

#### `bot.unlinkAccount(psid, [callback])`

Unlinks the user with the corresponding `psid`, and calls the callback if any. Returns a promise. See [Account Unlink Endpoint].(https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/identity/account-linking?locale=en_US#unlink)

* `psid` - Number: The Facebook ID of the user who has to be logged out.
* `callback` - (Optional) Function: Called with `(err, info)` once the request has completed. `err` contains an error, if any, and `info` contains the response from Facebook.

#### `bot.setGetStartedButton(payload, [callback])`
#### `bot.setPersistentMenu(payload, [callback])`

Sets settings for the Get Started Button / Persistent Menu. See the [Messenger Profile Reference](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/messenger-profile) for what to put in the `payload`.

187,187,peteanderson80/bottom-up-attention,Jupyter Notebook,"# bottom-up-attention

This code implements a bottom-up attention model, based on multi-gpu training of Faster R-CNN with ResNet-101, using object and attribute annotations from [Visual Genome](http://visualgenome.org/).

The pretrained model generates output features corresponding to salient image regions. These bottom-up attention features can typically be used as a drop-in replacement for CNN features in attention-based image captioning and visual question answering (VQA) models. This approach was used to achieve state-of-the-art image captioning performance on [MSCOCO](https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/3221#results) (**CIDEr 117.9**, **BLEU_4 36.9**) and to win the [2017 VQA Challenge](http://www.visualqa.org/workshop.html) (**70.3%** overall accuracy), as described in:
- [Bottom-Up and Top-Down Attention for Image Captioning and Visual Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.07998), and 
- [Tips and Tricks for Visual Question Answering: Learnings from the 2017 Challenge](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.02711). 

Some example object and attribute predictions for salient image regions are illustrated below.

### Pretrained features

For ease-of-use, we make pretrained features available for the entire [MSCOCO dataset](http://mscoco.org/dataset/#download). It is not necessary to clone or build this repo to use features downloaded from the links below. Features are stored in tsv (tab-separated-values) format that can be read with `tools/read_tsv.py`. 

**LINKS HAVE BEEN UPDATED TO GOOGLE CLOUD STORAGE (14 Feb 2021)**

10 to 100 features per image (adaptive):
- [2014 Train/Val Image Features (120K / 23GB)](https://storage.googleapis.com/up-down-attention/trainval.zip)
- [2014 Testing Image Features (40K / 7.3GB)](https://storage.googleapis.com/up-down-attention/test2014.zip)
- [2015 Testing Image Features (80K / 15GB)](https://storage.googleapis.com/up-down-attention/test2015.zip)

36 features per image (fixed):
- [2014 Train/Val Image Features (120K / 25GB)](https://storage.googleapis.com/up-down-attention/trainval_36.zip)
- [2014 Testing Image Features (40K / 9GB)](https://storage.googleapis.com/up-down-attention/test2014_36.zip)
- [2015 Testing Image Features (80K / 17GB)](https://storage.googleapis.com/up-down-attention/test2015_36.zip)

Both sets of features can be recreated by using `tools/generate_tsv.py` with the appropriate pretrained model and with MIN_BOXES/MAX_BOXES set to either 10/100 or 36/36 respectively - refer [Demo](#demo).

2. [Requirements: hardware](#requirements-hardware)
3. [Basic installation](#installation)
4. [Demo](#demo)
5. [Training](#training)
6. [Testing](#testing)

### Requirements: software

0. **`Important`** Please use the version of caffe contained within this repository.

1. Requirements for `Caffe` and `pycaffe` (see: [Caffe installation instructions](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/installation.html))

  **Note:** Caffe *must* be built with support for Python layers and NCCL!

  ```make
  # In your Makefile.config, make sure to have these lines uncommented
  WITH_PYTHON_LAYER := 1
  USE_NCCL := 1
  # Unrelatedly, it's also recommended that you use CUDNN
  USE_CUDNN := 1
  ```
2. Python packages you might not have: `cython`, `python-opencv`, `easydict`
3. Nvidia's NCCL library which is used for multi-GPU training https://github.com/NVIDIA/nccl

### Requirements: hardware

Any NVIDIA GPU with 12GB or larger memory is OK for training Faster R-CNN ResNet-101.

### Installation
1. Clone the repository
  ```Shell
  git clone https://github.com/peteanderson80/bottom-up-attention/
  ```

3. Build the Cython modules
    ```Shell
    cd $REPO_ROOT/lib
    make
    ```

4. Build Caffe and pycaffe
    ```Shell
    cd $REPO_ROOT/caffe
    # Now follow the Caffe installation instructions here:
    #   http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/installation.html

    # If you're experienced with Caffe and have all of the requirements installed
    # and your Makefile.config in place, then simply do:
    make -j8 && make pycaffe
   ```

### Demo

1.  Download [pretrained model](https://storage.googleapis.com/up-down-attention/resnet101_faster_rcnn_final.caffemodel), and put it under `data\faster_rcnn_models`.
   
2.  Run `tools/demo.ipynb` to show object and attribute detections on demo images.

3.  Run `tools/generate_tsv.py` to extract bounding box features to a tab-separated-values (tsv) file. This will require modifying the `load_image_ids` function to suit your data locations. To recreate the pretrained feature files with 10 to 100 features per image, set MIN_BOXES=10 and MAX_BOXES=100. To recreate the pretrained feature files with 36 features per image, set MIN_BOXES=36 and MAX_BOXES=36 use this [alternative pretrained model](https://storage.googleapis.com/bottom-up-attention/resnet101_faster_rcnn_final_iter_320000.caffemodel) instead. The alternative pretrained model was trained for fewer iterations but performance is similar.  

### Training

1. Download the Visual Genome dataset. Extract all the json files, as well as the image directories `VG_100K` and `VG_100K_2` into one folder `$VGdata`.

2. Create symlinks for the Visual Genome dataset

    ```Shell
    cd $REPO_ROOT/data
    ln -s $VGdata vg
    ``` 

3. Generate xml files for each image in the pascal voc format (this will take some time). This script will extract the top 2500/1000/500 objects/attributes/relations and also does basic cleanup of the visual genome data. Note however, that our training code actually only uses a subset of the annotations in the xml files, i.e., only 1600 object classes and 400 attribute classes, based on the hand-filtered vocabs found in `data/genome/1600-400-20`. The relevant part of the codebase is `lib/datasets/vg.py`. Relation labels can be included in the data layers but are currently not used.

    ```Shell
    cd $REPO_ROOT
    ./data/genome/setup_vg.py
    ``` 

4.  Please download the ImageNet-pre-trained ResNet-100 model manually, and put it into `$REPO_ROOT/data/imagenet_models`

5.  You can train your own model using `./experiments/scripts/faster_rcnn_end2end_multi_gpu_resnet_final.sh` (see instructions in file). The train (95k) / val (5k) / test (5k) splits are in `data/genome/{split}.txt` and have been determined using `data/genome/create_splits.py`. To avoid val / test set contamination when pre-training for MSCOCO tasks, for images in both datasets these splits match the 'Karpathy' COCO splits. 
  

    Trained Faster-RCNN snapshots are saved under:

    ```
    output/faster_rcnn_resnet/vg/
    ```

    Logging outputs are saved under:

    ```
    experiments/logs/
    ```

6.  Run `tools/review_training.ipynb` to visualize the training data and predictions.

### Testing 

1.  The model will be tested on the validation set at the end of training, or models can be tested directly using `tools/test_net.py`, e.g.:

    ```
    ./tools/test_net.py --gpu 0 --imdb vg_1600-400-20_val --def models/vg/ResNet-101/faster_rcnn_end2end_final/test.prototxt --cfg experiments/cfgs/faster_rcnn_end2end_resnet.yml --net data/faster_rcnn_models/resnet101_faster_rcnn_final.caffemodel > experiments/logs/eval.log 2<&1
    ```

    Mean AP is reported separately for object prediction and attibute prediction (given ground-truth object detections). Test outputs are saved under:

    ```
    output/faster_rcnn_resnet/vg_1600-400-20_val/<network snapshot name>/
    ```

#### Expected detection results for the pretrained model

|                   | objects mAP@0.5     | objects weighted mAP@0.5 | attributes mAP@0.5    | attributes weighted mAP@0.5 |
|-------------------|:-------------------:|:------------------------:|:---------------------:|:---------------------------:|
|Faster R-CNN, ResNet-101 | 10.2%  | 15.1% | 7.8%  | 27.8% |


Note that mAP is relatively low because many classes overlap (e.g. person / man / guy), some classes can't be precisely located (e.g. street, field) and separate classes exist for singular and plural objects (e.g. person / people). We focus on performance in downstream tasks (e.g. image captioning, VQA) rather than detection performance.

```

6. run with <code>npm run snipe </code>.

7. Wait the bot do his job, if success, you will see like this picture. <br>
   <img src=""./assets/botimg.PNG"">
   
8. Close bot with <code>ctrl + C</code>.

## WARNING
All this bot feature are free, I'm never sell this bot, and I'm never share my TG account. Please be careful and DWYOR!. Only this bot is free, not advanced bot.

## TROUBLESHOOT
* there are some reason if your tx failed :
- you haven't approve your BNB
- your gas price are to small
- your GWEI are to small (use 15+ for early token)
- your slippage are to small (use 30+ for early token)

* Error with node :
  
 <img src=""./assets/wss-error.png"">
  
Hi all, for now <code>wss://bsc-ws-node.nariox.org:443</code> it won't be able to use again forever. for that you can use private node or build your own node. it more faster than public node.
there is my recommend for private node : 
  1. https://getblock.io/en/
  2. https://www.quicknode.com/
  3. https://www.ankr.com/ <br>
   
We also rent a full node with cheapest and also faster speed, you will get installation guide and maintenance for that just for $70/month, you can compare with private node that I recommend. The different full node with private node is, full node build in our own vps, so we can manage the speed and performance. for more info you can contact on discord : <code>countdown#4008</code>

- [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- [FFMPEG](https://www.ffmpeg.org/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (optional)

## Getting started

First, make sure you have all the required tools installed on your local machine then continue with these steps.

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/TannerGabriel/discord-bot.git

# Enter into the directory
cd discord-bot/

# Install the dependencies
npm install
```

## Required permissions

**Important:** Make sure that your bot has the `applications.commands` application scope enabled, which can be found under the `OAuth2` tap on the [developer portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications/)

### Configuration

After cloning the project and installing all dependencies, you need to add your Discord API token in the config.json file.

### Starting the application

```bash
node index.js
```

### Starting the application using Docker

```bash
# Build the image
docker build --tag discordbot .

# Run the image
docker run -d discordbot
```

## Deploying commands

Before you can use the bots slash command you first need to add them to your Discord server. You can use the `!deploy` command to do so.

<img src=""./assets/deploy-commands.png"">

After deploying the commands you should be able to see and access them by typing a slash:

<img src=""./assets/commands.png"">

## Features & Commands

<img src=""./assets/playing_song.png"">

## Common errors

Here is a list of common errors and how you can fix them.

### Dependencies aren't up to date

The packages used in this repository get updated often, especially the ytdl-core package. That is why it is always worth a try updating those if you get an error like `invalid URL: undefined` or when the bot crashes when running the play command.

```bash
npm install ytdl-core@latest
```

### FFMPEG is not installed on the machine running the bot

The `play` command requires FFMPEG to be installed on the machine that is running the bot. You can download it on the official [FFMPEG website](https://www.ffmpeg.org/). Note: This isn't relevant if you use the Dockerfile because it will install FFMPEG inside of the container.

[![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/pdf-bot.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pdf-bot) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/esbenp/pdf-bot.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/esbenp/pdf-bot) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/esbenp/pdf-bot/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/esbenp/pdf-bot?branch=master)

Easily create a microservice for generating PDFs using headless Chrome.

`pdf-bot` is installed on a server and will receive URLs to turn into PDFs through its API or CLI. `pdf-bot` will manage a queue of PDF jobs. Once a PDF job has run it will notify you using a webhook so you can fetch the API. `pdf-bot` supports storing PDFs on S3 out of the box. Failed PDF generations and Webhook pings will be retried after a configurable decaying schedule.

![How to use the pdf-bot CLI](http://imgur.com/aRHye2l.gif)

`pdf-bot` uses [`html-pdf-chrome`](https://github.com/westy92/html-pdf-chrome) under the hood and supports all the settings that it supports. Major thanks to [@westy92](https://github.com/westy92/html-pdf-chrome) for making this possible.

## How does it work?

Imagine you have an app that creates invoices. You want to save those invoices as PDF. You install `pdf-bot` on a server as an API. Your app server sends the URL of the invoice to the `pdf-bot` server. A cronjob on the `pdf-bot` server keeps checking for new jobs, generates a PDF using headless Chrome and sends the location back to the application server using a webhook.

## Prerequisites

* Node.js v6 or later

## Installation

```bash
$ npm install -g pdf-bot
$ pdf-bot install
```

> Make sure the node path is in your $PATH

`pdf-bot install` will prompt for some basic configurations and then create a storage folder where your database and pdf files will be saved.

### Configuration

`pdf-bot` comes packaged with sensible defaults. At the very minimum you must have a config file in the same folder from which you are executing `pdf-bot` with a `storagePath` given. However, in reality what you probably want to do is use the `pdf-bot install` command to generate a configuration file and then use an alias `ALIAS pdf-bot = ""pdf-bot -c /home/pdf-bot.config.js""`

`pdf-bot.config.js`
```js
var htmlPdf = require('html-pdf-chrome')

module.exports = {
  api: {
    token: 'crazy-secret'
  },
  generator: {
    completionTrigger: new htmlPdf.CompletionTrigger.Timer(1000) // 1 sec timeout
  },
  storagePath: 'storage'
}
```

```bash
$ pdf-bot -c ./pdf-bot.config.js push https://esbenp.github.io
```

[See a full list of the available configuration options.](#options)

## Usage guide

### Structure and concept

`pdf-bot` is meant to be a microservice that runs a server to generate PDFs for you. That usually means you will send requests from your application server to the PDF server to request an url to be generated as a PDF. `pdf-bot` will manage a queue and retry failed generations. Once a job is successfully generated a path to it will be sent back to your application server.

Let us check out the flow for an app that generates PDF invoices.

```
1. (App server): An invoice is created ----> Send URL to invoice to pdf-bot server
2. (pdf-bot server): Put the URL in the queue
3. (pdf-bot server): PDF is generated using headless Chrome
4. (pdf-bot server): (if failed try again using 1 min, 3 min, 10 min, 30 min, 60 min delay)
5. (pdf-bot server): Upload PDF to storage (e.g. Amazon S3)
6. (pdf-bot server): Send S3 location of PDF back to the app server
7. (App server): Receive S3 location of PDF -> Check signature sum matches for security
8. (App server): Handle PDF however you see fit (move it, download it, save it etc.)
```

You can send meta data to the `pdf-bot` server that will be sent back to the application. This can help you identify what PDF you are receiving.

### Setup

On your `pdf-bot` server start by creating a config file `pdf-bot.config.js`. [You can see an example file here](https://github.com/esbenp/pdf-bot/blob/master/examples/pdf-bot.config.js)

`pdf-bot.config.js`
```js
module.exports = {
  api: {
    port: 3000,
    token: 'api-token'
  },
  storage: {
    's3': createS3Config({
      bucket: '',
      accessKeyId: '',
      region: '',
      secretAccessKey: ''
    })
  },
  webhook: {
    secret: '1234',
    url: 'http://localhost:3000/webhooks/pdf'
  }
}
```

As a minimum you should configure an access token for your API. This will be used to authenticate jobs sent to your `pdf-bot` server. You also need to add a `webhook` configuration to have pdf notifications sent back to your application server. You should add a `secret` that will be used to generate a signature used to check that the request has not been tampered with during transfer.

Start your API using

`pdf-bot -c ./pdf-bot.config.js api`

This will start an [express server](http://expressjs.com) that listens for new jobs on port `3000`.

#### Setting up Chrome

`pdf-bot` uses [html-pdf-chrome](https://github.com/westy92/html-pdf-chrome) which in turns uses [chrome-launcher](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/tree/master/chrome-launcher) to launch chrome. You should check out those two resources on how to properly setup Chrome. However, with `chrome-launcher` Chrome should be started automatically. Otherwise, `html-pdf-chrome` has a small guide on how to have it running as a process using `pm2`.

You can install chrome on Ubuntu using

```
sudo apt-get update && apt-get install chromium-browser
```

If you are testing things on OSX or similar, `chrome-launcher` should be able to find and automatically startup Chrome for you.

#### Setting up the receiving API

In the [examples folder](https://github.com/esbenp/pdf-bot/blob/master/examples/receiving-api.js) there is a small example on how the application API could look. Basically, you just have to define an endpoint that will receive the webhook and check that the signature matches.

```javascript
api.post('/hook', function (req, res) {
  var signature = req.get('X-PDF-Signature', 'sha1=')

  var bodyCrypted = require('crypto')
    .createHmac('sha1', '12345')
    .update(JSON.stringify(req.body))
    .digest('hex')

  if (bodyCrypted !== signature) {
    res.status(401).send()
    return
  }

  console.log('PDF webhook received', JSON.stringify(req.body))

  res.status(204).send()
})
```

### Setup production environment

[Follow the guide under `production/` to see how to setup `pdf-bot` using `pm2` and `nginx`](https://github.com/esbenp/pdf-bot/blob/master/production/README.md)

### Setup crontab

We setup our crontab to continuously look for jobs that have not yet been completed.

```bash
* * * * * node $(npm bin -g)/pdf-bot -c ./pdf-bot.config.js shift:all >> /var/log/pdfbot.log 2>&1
* * * * * node $(npm bin -g)/pdf-bot -c ./pdf-bot.config.js ping:retry-failed >> /var/log/pdfbot.log 2>&1
```

### Quick example using the CLI

Let us assume I want to generate a PDF for `https://esbenp.github.io`. I can add the job using the `pdf-bot` CLI.

```bash
$ pdf-bot -c ./pdf-bot.config.js push https://esbenp.github.io --meta '{""id"":1}'
```

Next, if my crontab is not setup to run it automatically I can run it using the `shift:all` command

```bash
$ pdf-bot -c ./pdf-bot.config.js shift:all
```

This will look for the oldest uncompleted job and run it.

### How can I generate PDFs for sites that use Javascript?

This is a common issue with PDF generation. Luckily, `html-pdf-chrome` has a really awesome API for dealing with Javascript. You can specify a timeout in milliseconds, wait for elements or custom events. To add a wait simply configure the `generator` key in your configuration. Below are a few examples.

**Wait for 5 seconds**

```javascript
var htmlPdf = require('html-pdf-chrome')

module.exports = {
  api: {
    token: 'api-token'
  },
  // html-pdf-chrome options
  generator: {
    completionTrigger: new htmlPdf.CompletionTrigger.Timer(5000), // waits for 5 sec
  },
  webhook: {
    secret: '1234',
    url: 'http://localhost:3000/webhooks/pdf'
  }
}
```

**Wait for event**

```javascript
var htmlPdf = require('html-pdf-chrome')

module.exports = {
  api: {
    token: 'api-token'
  },
  // html-pdf-chrome options
  generator: {
    completionTrigger: new htmlPdf.CompletionTrigger.Event(
      'myEvent', // name of the event to listen for
      '#myElement', // optional DOM element CSS selector to listen on, defaults to body
      5000 // optional timeout (milliseconds)
    )
  },
  webhook: {
    secret: '1234',
    url: 'http://localhost:3000/webhooks/pdf'
  }
}
```

In your Javascript trigger the event when rendering is complete

```javascript
document.getElementById('myElement').dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('myEvent'));
```

**Wait for variable**

```javascript
var htmlPdf = require('html-pdf-chrome')

module.exports = {
  api: {
    token: 'api-token'
  },
  // html-pdf-chrome options
  generator: {
    completionTrigger: new htmlPdf.CompletionTrigger.Variable(
      'myVarName', // optional, name of the variable to wait for.  Defaults to 'htmlPdfDone'
      5000 // optional, timeout (milliseconds)
    )
  },
  webhook: {
    secret: '1234',
    url: 'http://localhost:3000/webhooks/pdf'
  }
}
```

In your Javascript set the variable when the rendering is complete

```javascript
window.myVarName = true;
```

[You can find more completion triggers in html-pdf-chrome's documentation](https://github.com/westy92/html-pdf-chrome#trigger-render-completion)

## API

Below are given the endpoints that are exposed by `pdf-server`'s REST API

### Push URL to queue: POST /

key | type | required | description
--- | ---- | -------- | -----------
url | string | yes | The URL to generate a PDF from
meta | object | | Optional meta data object to send back to the webhook url

#### Example

```bash
curl -X POST -H 'Authorization: Bearer api-token' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' http://pdf-bot.com/ -d '
  {
    ""url"":""https://esbenp.github.io"",
    ""meta"":{
      ""type"":""invoice"",
      ""id"":1
    }
  }'
```

## Database

### LowDB (file-database) (default)

If you have low conurrency (run a job every now and then) you can use the default database driver that uses LowDB.

```javascript
var LowDB = require('pdf-bot/src/db/lowdb')

module.exports = {
  api: {
    token: 'api-token'
  },
  db: LowDB({
    lowDbOptions: {},
    path: '' // defaults to $storagePath/db/db.json
  }),
  webhook: {
    secret: '1234',
    url: 'http://localhost:3000/webhooks/pdf'
  }
}
```

### PostgreSQL

```javascript
var pgsql = require('pdf-bot/src/db/pgsql')

module.exports = {
  api: {
    token: 'api-token'
  },
  db: pgsql({
    database: 'pdfbot',
    username: 'pdfbot',
    password: 'pdfbot',
    port: 5432
  }),
  webhook: {
    secret: '1234',
    url: 'http://localhost:3000/webhooks/pdf'
  }
}
```

Optionally, you can specify a database url by specifying a `connectionString`.

To install the necessary database tables, run `db:migrate`. You can also destroy the database by running `db:destroy`.

## Storage

Currently `pdf-bot` comes bundled with build-in support for storing PDFs on Amazon S3.

[Feel free to contribute a PR if you want to see other storage plugins in `pdf-bot`](https://github.com/esbenp/pdf-bot/compare)!

### Amazon S3

To install S3 storage add a key to the `storage` configuration. Notice, you can add as many different locations you want by giving them different keys.

```javascript
var createS3Config = require('pdf-bot/src/storage/s3')

module.exports = {
  api: {
    token: 'api-token'
  },
  storage: {
    'my_s3': createS3Config({
      bucket: '[YOUR BUCKET NAME]',
      accessKeyId: '[YOUR ACCESS KEY ID]',
      region: '[YOUR REGION]',
      secretAccessKey: '[YOUR SECRET ACCESS KEY]'
    })
  },
  webhook: {
    secret: '1234',
    url: 'http://localhost:3000/webhooks/pdf'
  }
}

```

## Options

```javascript
var decaySchedule = [
  1000 * 60, // 1 minute
  1000 * 60 * 3, // 3 minutes
  1000 * 60 * 10, // 10 minutes
  1000 * 60 * 30, // 30 minutes
  1000 * 60 * 60 // 1 hour

    // The token used to validate requests to your API. Not required, but 100% recommended.
    token: 'api-token'
  },

    port: 9222
  },
  queue: {
    // How frequent should pdf-bot retry failed generations?
    // (default: 1 min, 3 min, 10 min, 30 min, 60 min)
    generationRetryStrategy: function(job, retries) {
      return decaySchedule[retries - 1] ? decaySchedule[retries - 1] : 0
    },
    // How many times should pdf-bot try to generate a PDF?
    // (default: 5)
    generationMaxTries: 5,
    // How many generations to run at the same time when using shift:all
    parallelism: 4,
    // How frequent should pdf-bot retry failed webhook pings?
    // (default: 1 min, 3 min, 10 min, 30 min, 60 min)
    webhookRetryStrategy: function(job, retries) {
      return decaySchedule[retries - 1] ? decaySchedule[retries - 1] : 0
    },
    // How many times should pdf-bot try to ping a webhook?
    // (default: 5)
    webhookMaxTries: 5
  },
  storage: {
    's3': createS3Config({
      bucket: '',
      accessKeyId: '',
      region: '',
      secretAccessKey: ''
    })
  },
  webhook: {
    // The prefix to add to all pdf-bot headers on the webhook response.
    // I.e. X-PDF-Transaction and X-PDF-Signature. (default: X-PDF-)
    headerNamespace: 'X-PDF-',
    // Extra request options to add to the Webhook ping.
    requestOptions: {

    },
    // The secret used to generate the hmac-sha1 signature hash.
    // !Not required, but should definitely be included!
    secret: '1234',
    // The endpoint to send PDF messages to.
    url: 'http://localhost:3000/webhooks/pdf'
  }
}
```

194,194,alexschimpf/Snkrs-Bot,Python,"# PLEASE READ!


This is a Selenium bot for buying a given sneaker from the Nike Snkrs website ON RELEASE DAY.
   It will not work for sneakers that are past their release day (or later in the release day).
   `Please note that this script was written with the US site in mind, so Nike sites for other countries will likely cause problems.`
   This is because the purchase page changes to where the buy button redirects to a seperate checkout page (as opposed to a direct buy popup during release).
It is a commandline script written solely in python. `Please run with python 3.7.`
There are 6 selenium drivers in the bin directory for both Chrome and Firefox on Linux, MacOS, and Winows. `The drivers for other operating systems need to be installed from the instructions below.`
I have found the Firefox driver for MacOS works best.

Ideally, some pieces (or all?) of this could be replaced with direct Nike API requests instead of Selenium. However, I've found that Nike APIs are not very straightforward.


# Getting started

There are a few requirements to run the bot. First, you'll need to install `Python 3.7` or greater. The instructions below show you how to do this in several operating systems

Next, we have provided the web drivers for MacOS, Linux, and Windows, but if they're not there, or you want something more up-to-date than the included drivers, you'll need to download them yourself with the instructions below

Finally, the program is run from the terminal (command line), so you should familiarize yourself with running python programs from the terminal [here](https://realpython.com/run-python-scripts/)

## Downloading python


This needs to be Python version `3.7` or up

MacOS
   * From Python's official website [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/mac-osx/)
   * If you have [brew](https://brew.sh) installed, you can just run the coommand `brew install python3`

Linux
   * From Python's official website [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/source/)
   * Using the package manager for your system. With Ubuntu, this command is `sudo apt install python3-dev`

Windows
   * From Python's official website [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/)
   * If you have the [Chocolatey package manager](https://chocolatey.org/) installed, you can run `choco install python`

1. The selenium webdrivers for your chosen browser


## Installing the web drivers

* The drivers for most browsers can be found on selenium's site [here](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/en/getting_started_with_webdriver/browsers/), although at the moment, only Firefox and Chrome are supported

* NOTE: There are already webdrivers for Chrome and Firefox, for MacOS, Linux, and Windows, which will be loaded if no other webdriver is specified manually

# Usage

1. Make sure that you have done all the Pre-installation requirements in the `Getting Started` section above

1. Clone this repository's source code
   1. If you have git installed, this can be done as easily as `git clone https://github.com/alexschimpf/Snkrs-Bot`
   1. Otherwise, download the zipped source code and unzip it

1. Navigate to the project's code
   * `cd path/to/downloaded/project`

1. Install all the Python dependencies by running
  * `pip install -r requirements.txt`

1. Run the bot
   * Replace all the fields in the command below with the options that you want, and any of the configuration options listed below
   ```bash
   python3 main.py --username myemail@gmail.com --password abc123 --url <your-shoes-url> --shoe-size 6 --driver-type chrome
   ```

# Configuration options

Here is a list and description of the different arguments to use for the script:

<b>--username</b>
* Username for login

<b>--password</b>
* Password for login

<b>--url</b>
* URL for desired shoe
* Size parameter can also be passed in (for example: https://www.nike.com/launch/t/kobe-5-protro-bruce-lee?size=11). In this case, `--shoe-size` and `--shoe-type` will be ignored
* DO NOT pass in size parameter with url on releases with ""Additional Size Ranges"" (i.e. children's shoes on same page) as it can lead to unexpected results

<b>--shoe-size</b>
* Self-explanatory

<b>--shoe-type</b>
* Men's (M), Women's (W), Youth (Y) or Child (C)
* For special releases (i.e. Air Presto), can pass in XXS, XS, S, M, L or XL. You do not need to pass in shoe size

<b>--cvv</b>
* Card Verification Value for your stored credit card
* May not be needed in some cases (for example, if you have previously purchased a release with a stored credit card)

<b>--shipping-option</b>
* STANDARD, TWO_DAY or NEXT_DAY

<b>--shipping-address</b>
* If given, the bot will attempt to add a new shipping address in some scenarios
* In some cases, checkout will not proceed without adding a new shipping address. If you are unsure, include it
* Must be in this format: '{""first_name"":""John"", ""last_name"":""Doe"", ""address"":""1313 Mockingbird Lane"", ""apt"":"""", ""city"":""Long Beach"", ""state"":""CA"", ""zip_code"":""90712"", ""phone_number"":""9999999999""}'

<b>--login-time</b>
* If given, the bot will pause until a specific time before it logs in (can be any datetime format)

<b>--release-time</b>
* If given, the bot will pause until a specific time before it purchase the sneaker (can be any datetime format)

<b>--screenshot-path</b>
* If given, the bot will take a screenshot of the page after purchasing and save it at the given file path (may be useful for debugging)

<b>--html-path</b>
* If given, the bot will take the page source after purchasing and save it at the given file path (may be useful for debugging)

<b>--page-load-timeout</b>
* This is used to limit the page load time (in seconds), which can be useful when the page is still loading, but the UI is nevertheless useable. This is pretty much a necessity as I've noticed Nike's pages hang all the time. I'd recommend using 1-3 seconds for this.

<b>--driver-type</b>
* Should be 'firefox' or 'chrome' (the OS will be determined for you)
* Defaults to `Firefox` if nothing is specified

<b>--webdriver-path</b>
* If specified, will use the specified driver instead of the defaults
* NOTE: The driver should match the browser specified in the `--driver-type` option (defaults to Firefox)

<b>--headless</b>
* This will run the driver in headless mode, which should make the bot quicker

<b>--select-payment</b>
* If you already have your payment options pre-saved on your Nike account, DO NOT use this. If for some reason you don't have it pre-saved (even though it will cost the bot more time) the bot will select the first payment option it finds.

<b>--purchase</b>
* If this argument is given, the bot WILL attempt to purchase the shoe so USE WITH CAUTION!

<b>--num-retries</b>
* If the bot fails for some reason, it will retry any number of times or until successful

<b>--dont-quit</b>
* Prevent browser from closing. Please note, if you are passing the `--purchase` parameter, it may be necessary to pass this parameter in

197,197,hartleybrody/fb-messenger-bot,Python,"# Facebook Messenger Bot
This is a simple python template that uses Flask to build a webhook for Facebook's Messenger Bot API.

Read more in my [tutorial that uses this repository](https://blog.hartleybrody.com/fb-messenger-bot/).

*New:* [Check out my Facebook Messenger Bot Course](https://facebook-messenger-bot.teachable.com/p/facebook-messenger-bot/). It walks you through the process of getting this bot hosted on heroku step-by-step, and also unlocks all the content that's hidden in this repo's branches.

## ""Callback verification failed""

![Facebook Error](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/18402893/21538944/f96fcd1e-cdc7-11e6-83ee-a866190d9080.png)

The #1 error that gets reported in issues is that facebook returns an error message (like above) when trying to add the heroku endpoint to your facebook chat application.

Our flask application intentionally returns a 403 Forbidden error if the token that facebook sends doesn't match the token you set using the heroku configuration variables.

If you're getting this error, it likely means that you didn't set your heroku config values properly. Run `heroku config` from the command line within your application and verify that there's a key called `VERIFY_TOKEN` that has been set, and that it's set to the same value as what you've typed into the window on facebook."

4. ***This step is optional and WILL NOT work on Windows.*** <br>The bot will automatically use uvloop (fastest event loop) if it's installed. To install uvloop, enter this into terminal:

    ```
    pip install -U uvloop
    ```

_Claudia Bot Builder_ helps developers create and deploy chat-bots for various platforms in minutes to AWS Lambda. It simplifies the messaging workflows, automatically sets up the correct web hooks, and guides you through configuration steps, so that you can focus on important business problems and not have to worry about infrastructure code.

| [🚀 Getting Started](https://claudiajs.com/tutorials/hello-world-chatbot.html) | [🛠 API Docs](docs/API.md) | [🤖 Example projects](https://github.com/claudiajs/example-projects#chat-bots) | [🤔 FAQ](#frequently-asked-questions) | [💬 Chat on Gitter](https://gitter.im/claudiajs/claudia) |
|-----------------|----------|------------------|-----|----|

Check out [this two minute video](https://youtu.be/NvCfEuD3Nk4) to see how you can create and deploy a bot quickly:

[![](https://claudiajs.com/assets/claudia-bot-builder-video.jpg)](https://youtu.be/NvCfEuD3Nk4)

Here's a simple example:

```javascript
const botBuilder = require('claudia-bot-builder');
const excuse = require('huh');

module.exports = botBuilder(function (message) {
  return 'Thanks for sending ' + message.text +
    'Your message is very important to us, but ' +
    excuse.get();
});
```

This code is enough to operate bots for all supported platforms. Claudia Bot Builder automatically parses the incoming messages into a common format, so you can handle it easily. It also automatically packages the response into the correct message template for the requesting bot, so you do not have to worry about individual bot protocols.

## Supported platforms

* Facebook Messenger
* Slack (channel slash commands and apps with slash commands)
* Skype
* Viber
* Telegram
* Twilio (messaging service)
* Amazon Alexa
* Line
* Kik
* GroupMe

## Creating bots

[![](https://nodei.co/npm/claudia-bot-builder.svg?downloads=true&downloadRank=true&stars=true)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/claudia-bot-builder)

Check out the [Getting Started](https://claudiajs.com/tutorials/hello-world-chatbot.html) guide for information on how to set up a simple bot in minutes and [API Documentation](docs/API.md) for detailed information on the API.

## Examples

See the [Chat-Bots section](https://github.com/claudiajs/example-projects#chat-bots) of the Claudia.js example projects list

## Frequently asked questions

1. **How to run it locally?**

   You can't. At least not easy. Claudia Bot Builder doesn't have a stand-alone http server in the background (such as Express, Hapi, etc.), instead it uses API Gateway and it's not trivial to simulate similar environment locally. Deploy it with `--version test` to create a separate test environment directly in AWS Lambda.

2. **How to test your bot?**

   Your chat bot is just a Lambda function, which means it is just a simple JavaScript function and you should be able to, at least in theory, run everything locally as simple automated tests.

   The most important thing is to design testable Lambda functions, [this guide](https://claudiajs.com/tutorials/designing-testable-lambdas.html) will help you to do that.

   Integration tests can be a bit more complex if you have some integrations with external or AWS services. Check [this guide](https://claudiajs.com/tutorials/testing-locally.html) to see how to write integration tests and run automated tests locally.

3. **My Facebook messenger bot responds to my messages only. Why it's not responding to everyone?**

   Facebook has [a review process](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/app-review) for chat bots. Make sure your bot is approved.

4. **Can I send Slack slash command delayed responses?**

   Yes, here's [the tutorial for that](https://claudiajs.com/tutorials/slack-delayed-responses.html).

5. **What's new in v2?**

   It's a new major version because of the dependencies - there are big improvements in the _Claudia API Builder_ and _Claudia_, so _Claudia Bot Builder_ v1.x is not compatible with them.  
   V2.x also brings support for many new platforms.

6. **How to speed up the deployment**

   You can use `claudia update` with `--cache-api-config` flag to cache the API Gateway config, for more info visit [docs page for claudia update](https://github.com/claudiajs/claudia/blob/master/docs/update.md).

   Also, from version 2.7.0, you can disable platforms that you are not using, check the full explanation in the [API docs](https://github.com/claudiajs/claudia-bot-builder/blob/master/docs/API.md#selecting-platforms).

Botflow
=======
0.2.0 alpha


* Dataflow programming framework
* Paralleled in coroutines and ThreadPool
* Type- and content-based route function
* Interactive programming with Jupyter Notebook

Requirements
------------
`Graphviz <http://brewformulas.org/Graphviz>`_.

Installing
----------

Install and update using ``pip``:

`pip install -U botflow`

Documentation
------------

http://botflow.readthedocs.io




What's dataflow programming?
===============================

All functions are connected by pipes (queues) and communicate by data.  

When data come in, the function will be called and return the result.

Think about the pipeline operation in unix: ``ls|grep|sed``.

Benefits:

#. Decouple data and functionality
#. Easy to reuse 

Botflow provides pipe and route. It makes dataflow programming and powerful data flow processes easier.


Botflow is...
=============

- **Simple**

Botflow is easy to use and maintain, *does not need configuration files*, and knows about ``asyncio`` and how to parallelize computation.

Here's one of the simple applications you can make:

_Load the price of Bitcoin every 2 seconds. Advantage price aggregator sample can be found `here <https://github.com/kkyon/Botflow/tree/master/examples>`_.


.. code-block:: python

    from botflow import *


    def main():
        Pipe(

            Timer(delay=2),  # send timer data to pipe every 2 seconds
            ""http://api.coindesk.com/v1/bpi/currentprice.json"",  # send url to pipe when timer trigger
            HttpLoader(),  # read url and load http response
            lambda r: r.json['bpi']['USD']['rate_float'],  # read http response and parse as json
            print,  # print out

        )

        Bot.render('ex_output/simple_bitcoin_price')
        Bot.run()
    main()

**Or write in chain style**


.. code-block:: python



    from botflow import *
    p_cd_bitcoin=Pipe().Timer(delay=2).Loop(""http://api.coindesk.com/v1/bpi/currentprice.json"")\
                .HttpLoader().Map(lambda r: r.json['bpi']['USD']['rate_float']).Map(print)

    p_cd_bitcoin.run()



 
- **Flow Graph**
With render function:
`Bot.render('bitcoin_arbitrage')`
Botflow will render the data flow network into a graphviz image.
below is the flow graph generated by Botflow.Aggreate 6 exchanges bitcoin price for trading.


.. image:: docs/bitcoin_arbitrage.png
    :width: 400  


 

- **Fast**
Nodes will be run in parallel, and they will perform well when processing stream data.
:Web Crawle: Botflow is 10x fatter than Scrapy


 

- **Replay-able**

With replay mode enabled:
``config.replay_mode=True``
when an exception is raised at step N, you don't need to run from setup 1 to N.
Botflow will replay the data from nearest completed node, usually step N-1.
It will save a lot of time in the development phase.

Release

:**0.2.0**: Milestone release.:

            # Jupyter support. Able to run inside Jupyter note book.

            # pipe can be nest in another Pipe.


            p1=Pipe(get_image)
            p2=Pipe(get_price)
            p_get_all=Pipe(Zip(p1,p2)).Filter

            # Support Chain style pipe line creating.

                Pipe(range(1,10)).Map(lambda x:x+1).Fiter(lambda x:x>2)

                same as :

                Pipe(range(1,10),lambda x:x+1,Filter(lambda x:x>2))



:**0.1.9**: Major change see below .:

            # Backpressure rate limit support

            # Httpserver support

            # new Node support. *Zip*, *SendTo* *Flat* for make loop and redirect the flow

            # Type hints support .for function type route

            # reorge the source code for readable.


:**0.1.8**: http://docs.botflow.org/en/latest/change/0.1.8.html .:
            
            #. Support parallel in ThreadPool for slow function.
            
            #. Loop Node  is  deprecated. raw value and Iterable value can be used directly.
            
            #. improve performance of BlockedJoin
            
:**0.1.7**: 


RoadMap
=======
- Will add Httpserver support(REST,Websocket).  
- Will support server machine learning Model online.
- Finshe the api reference doc.
- Rename project to Botflow.?

More about Botflow
===============

Data-
programming is typically applied to streams of structured data for filtering, transforming, aggregating (such as computing statistics), or calling other programs.

Botflow has a few basic concepts to implement Dataflow programming .

- **Source**
        It is feed stream data to the pipe.

    * **Timer**: It will send a message in the pipe by timer param. **delay**, **max_time** **until** some finished
    * **Pipe.run**: you can use Pipe.run to trigger the data into pipe. By default it will feed int **0**



- **Function**
        It is callable unit.Any callable function and object can work as Node. It is driven by data. Custom functions work as Map unit.
        There are some built-in nodes:

   

   * **Fetch**: (Alias:HttpLoader)  Get a url and return the HTTP response
   * **AioFile**: for file I/O.
   * **SpeedLimit**: limit the stream speed limit
   * **Delay**: delay in special second.
   * **Map**  : Work ad Convert unit.
   * **Filter** : Drop data from pipe if it does not match some condition
   * **Flat** : Drop data from pipe if it does not match some condition


- **Route**
        It will be used to create a complex data flow network, not just one main process. Botflow can nest Routes inside Routes.
        It is a powerful concept.
        There are some pre built-in Route:
    * **Pipe**: It is the main stream process of the program. All units will work inside.
    * **Tee** : (Alias:Branch) Duplicate data from parent pipe to a child pipe as branch.
    * **Zip** :   Combine multi pipes result to list.
    * **Link**: (Alias: LinkTo)  Route flow to any Node or Route for making loop , circle


All units (Pipe, Node, Route) communicate via queues and perform parallel computation in coroutines.
This is abstracted so that Botflow can be used with only limited knowledge of ``asyncio``.

# Important Notice

I'm no longer actively maintaining this project. If you are interested supporting it - [ping me on twitter](https://twitter.com/vesln).
The only thing that I will ask you is to not change the API drastically. If you are planning on doing that - better start a brand new project.

If you want me to transfer you only the name on npm, I'd be happy to only if the project **does not have any downloads on npm lately**. In case it's being
downloaded, there are people that depend on it and might step up and start maintaining, so I will not transfer it to you, regardless if you want to release
a new major version etc.

If you have any other questions, let me know.

Thanks!

Veselin

Android Support Library 23.2里的 Design Support Library新加了一个Bottom Sheets控件，一个底部表，就是我们经常在分享或者地图、音乐等app看到的效果

 <img src=""https://material-design.storage.googleapis.com/publish/material_v_4/material_ext_publish/0Bzhp5Z4wHba3VW9HUDhtTE5XZVk/components_bottomsheets_usage2.png"" width=""360"" height=""640"" />

昨天晚上Support Library 23.2包还没能更新，官方视频就已经透露出了，[视频地址](https://youtu.be/7E2lNBM38IE?list=PLWz5rJ2EKKc9e0d55YHgJFHXNZbGHEXJX),从视频看出Support Library 23.2包新增了:

* 1. Support Vector Drawables and Animated Vector Drawables
* 2. AppCompat DayNight theme
* 3. Design Support Library: Bottom Sheets
* 4. Support v4: MediaBrowserServiceCompat
* 5. RecyclerView
* 6. Custom Tabs
* 7. Leanback for Android TV

具体可以上官网博客看看。

这篇文章我给大家说说BottomSheetBehavior的使用及注意的地方

##Usage
###(1)在布局文件xml中
```xml
<?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""utf-8""?>
<android.support.design.widget.CoordinatorLayout
    xmlns:android=""http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android""
    xmlns:app=""http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto""
    android:id=""@+id/cl""
    android:layout_width=""match_parent""
    android:layout_height=""match_parent""
    android:fitsSystemWindows=""true""
    >

    <android.support.v4.widget.NestedScrollView
        android:id=""@+id/bottom_sheet""
        android:layout_width=""match_parent""
        android:layout_height=""wrap_content""
        app:behavior_hideable=""true""
        app:behavior_peekHeight=""50dp""
        app:layout_behavior=""@string/bottom_sheet_behavior""
        >
          <!-- NestedScrollView里设置你的底部表长什么样的-->
    </android.support.v4.widget.NestedScrollView>
</android.support.design.widget.CoordinatorLayout>

```
###(2)在java代码中
```java
  @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_ns);

        // The View with the BottomSheetBehavior
        CoordinatorLayout coordinatorLayout = (CoordinatorLayout) findViewById(R.id.cl);
        View bottomSheet = coordinatorLayout.findViewById(R.id.bottom_sheet);
        final BottomSheetBehavior behavior = BottomSheetBehavior.from(bottomSheet);
        behavior.setBottomSheetCallback(new BottomSheetBehavior.BottomSheetCallback() {
            @Override
            public void onStateChanged(@NonNull View bottomSheet, int newState) {
                //这里是bottomSheet 状态的改变回调
            }

            @Override
            public void onSlide(@NonNull View bottomSheet, float slideOffset) {
                //这里是拖拽中的回调，根据slideOffset可以做一些动画
            }
        });
    }
```

其实也挺简单的，我来解释一下。通过附加一个BottomSheetBehavior 给CoordinatorLayout的子视图，上文xml中的是NestedScrollView(adding app:layout_behavior = "" android.support.design.widget.BottomSheetBehavior”)，当然，RecyclerView也是可以的。如果需要BottomSheet View可以保持滚动，需要支持 nested scrolling (例如: NestedScrollView, RecyclerView, or ListView/ScrollView on API 21+).

```xml
     app:behavior_hideable=""true""
     app:behavior_peekHeight=""50dp""
```
这两个属性我说说，peekHeight是当Bottom Sheets关闭的时候，底部下表我们能看到的高度，hideable 是当我们拖拽下拉的时候，bottom sheet是否能全部隐藏。
如果你需要监听Bottom Sheets回调的状态，可以通过setBottomSheetCallback来实现，onSlide方法是拖拽中的回调，根据slideOffset可以做一些动画
onStateChanged方法可以监听到状态的改变,总共有5种

* STATE_COLLAPSED: 关闭Bottom Sheets,显示peekHeight的高度，默认是0
* STATE_DRAGGING:  用户拖拽Bottom Sheets时的状态
* STATE_SETTLING: 当Bottom Sheets view摆放时的状态。
* STATE_EXPANDED: 当Bottom Sheets 展开的状态
* STATE_HIDDEN: 当Bottom Sheets 隐藏的状态

我也简单的写了BottomSheetBehavior和BottomSheetDialog的demo，你可以看我源码是怎么用的
 <img src=""https://github.com/android-cjj/BottomSheets/blob/master/gif%2Fbs1.gif"" width=""240"" height=""360"" />
 <img src=""https://github.com/android-cjj/BottomSheets/blob/master/gif%2Fdialog.gif"" width=""240"" height=""360"" />
 <img src=""https://github.com/android-cjj/BottomSheets/blob/master/gif%2Fbs12.gif"" width=""240"" height=""360"" />

使用就这些了，接下来我们来讲讲该注意的地方，应该说怎样更好的使用它。

###（1）关闭Bottom Sheets的行为
可以通过下图的形式，拖拽、点击bottom sheet之外的地方和通过‘x’按钮

 <img src=""https://material-design.storage.googleapis.com/publish/material_v_4/material_ext_publish/0Bzhp5Z4wHba3a3Z2UGZJMkRWamM/components_bottomsheets_behavior1.png"" width=""240"" height=""240"" />
  <img src=""https://material-design.storage.googleapis.com/publish/material_v_4/material_ext_publish/0Bzhp5Z4wHba3cGt6TlA0ZzNLdDg/components_bottomsheets_behavior2.png"" width=""240"" height=""240"" />
   <img src=""https://material-design.storage.googleapis.com/publish/material_v_4/material_ext_publish/0Bzhp5Z4wHba3cTdiQWp2TkI0NEE/components_bottomsheets_behavior3.png"" width=""240"" height=""240"" />
   
###（2）合适的视图设计

 <img src=""https://material-design.storage.googleapis.com/publish/material_v_4/material_ext_publish/0Bzhp5Z4wHba3MC0zbFNZaU1lUkk/components_bottomsheets_modal9.png"" width=""360"" height=""640"" />
  <img src=""https://material-design.storage.googleapis.com/publish/material_v_4/material_ext_publish/0Bzhp5Z4wHba3TnJEQUF3Y0JVb2c/components_bottomsheets_modal10.png"" width=""360"" height=""640"" />
  
 上图你可明显的看到第二幅这种设计是不合适的，空白太多，不美观，对吧！
 
  <img src=""https://material-design.storage.googleapis.com/publish/material_v_4/material_ext_publish/0Bzhp5Z4wHba3Ym9QLTlfbUR4ekk/components_bottomsheets_modal11.png"" width=""360"" height=""640"" />
  <img src=""https://material-design.storage.googleapis.com/publish/material_v_4/material_ext_publish/0Bzhp5Z4wHba3YmVmTWVhMWtZbFk/components_bottomsheets_modal12.png"" width=""360"" height=""640"" />
  
  如果Bottom Sheets 展开或者上拉覆盖了ActionBar or ToolBar 这种方式也是不合适的.
  
###(3)尺寸的设计
为了符合Material Design 设计，我们对尺寸有严格的要求，当然，你想随意我也阻止不了

  <img src=""https://material-design.storage.googleapis.com/publish/material_v_4/material_ext_publish/0Bzhp5Z4wHba3dXNVNEpIZzZQdUU/components_bottomsheets_specs1.png"" width=""240"" height=""240"" />
   <img src=""https://material-design.storage.googleapis.com/publish/material_v_4/material_ext_publish/0Bzhp5Z4wHba3Q3NrbGhWQXJxSGs/components_bottomsheets_specs3.png"" width=""240"" height=""240"" />
  <img src=""https://material-design.storage.googleapis.com/publish/material_v_4/material_ext_publish/0Bzhp5Z4wHba3a2JBazEtX3R2Ulk/components_bottomsheets_specs7.png"" width=""240"" height=""240"" />
  
  我想说的就这些了，如果还有补充，欢迎PR!

# EASY AUTO CONFIGURATION INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE NGINX BAD BOT BLOCKER
## Please follow the instructions below step by step :exclamation:

- This is our new preferred method of installation which is now done through a set of shell scripts contributed to this repo and maintained by Stuart Cardall @itoffshore who is one of the Alpine Linux package maintainers. 

- The instructions below are for a quick and painfree installation process which downloads all required files for the blocker and the scripts include adding the required includes to your nginx.conf and nginx .vhost files. The setup script assumes your vhost config files are located in /etc/nginx/sites-available/ and each vhost config file ends with a file extension of .vhost

- For manual installation instructions please see - Please see: https://github.com/mitchellkrogza/nginx-ultimate-bad-bot-blocker/blob/master/MANUAL-CONFIGURATION.md

- setup-ngxblocker, install-ngxblocker and update-ngxblocker can all be configured with custom installation / update locations from the command line. **(See Step 11 of the instructions to show you how use these scripts and non-standard Nginx locations)**

- Run any of the setup, install or update scripts with --help or -h to view options.

> PLEASE NOTE: For those using Let's Encrypt SSL Certificates the preferred and 100% working method is to use the **Webroot Authenticator Method**. There appears to be some issues with people using the http challenge method but can confirm that webroot work flawlessly. We are uncertain at this point whether the http-01 challenge method is a certbot or nginx bug.

************************************************
<img src=""https://github.com/mitchellkrogza/nginx-ultimate-bad-bot-blocker/blob/master/.assets/step-1.png""/>

##### Linux

Download install-ngxblocker to your /usr/local/sbin/directory and make the script executable.

```sh
sudo wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mitchellkrogza/nginx-ultimate-bad-bot-blocker/master/install-ngxblocker -O /usr/local/sbin/install-ngxblocker
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/sbin/install-ngxblocker
```

If your Linux distribution does not have wget you can replace the wget command above using curl as follows:

```sh
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mitchellkrogza/nginx-ultimate-bad-bot-blocker/master/install-ngxblocker -o /usr/local/sbin/install-ngxblocker
```

##### FreeBSD

Install the package.

```sh
pkg install www/nginx-ultimate-bad-bot-blocker
```

Alternatively install via portmaster:

```sh
portmaster www/nginx-ultimate-bad-bot-blocker
```

************************************************
<img src=""https://github.com/mitchellkrogza/nginx-ultimate-bad-bot-blocker/blob/master/.assets/step-2.png""/>

Now run the install-ngxblocker script in DRY-MODE which will show you what changes it will make and what files it will download for you. This is only a DRY-RUN so no changes are being made yet. 

The install-ngxblocker downloads all required files including the setup and update scripts.

```sh
cd /usr/local/sbin
sudo ./install-ngxblocker
```

This will show you output as follows of the changes that will be made 
**(NOTE: this is only a DRY-RUN no changes have been made)**

All the required files have now been downloaded to the correct folders on Nginx for you direct from the repository.

**MAKE SURE you set your setup and update scripts to be executable by running the following two commands. This is important before continuing with Step 4 and onwards.**

```sh
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/sbin/setup-ngxblocker
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/sbin/update-ngxblocker
```

**setup-ngxblocker, install-ngxblocker and update-ngxblocker can all be configured with custom installation / update locations from the command line.** 

**Run any of the setup, install or update scripts with --help or -h to view options.**

************************************************
<img src=""https://github.com/mitchellkrogza/nginx-ultimate-bad-bot-blocker/blob/master/.assets/step-4.png""/>

Now run the setup-ngxblocker script in DRY-MODE which will show you what changes it will make and what files it will download for you. This is only a DRY-RUN so no changes are being made yet.

```sh
cd /usr/local/sbin/
sudo ./setup-ngxblocker
```

This will give you output as follows (this output below assumes your nginx.conf file already has the default include of /etc/nginx/conf.d/*)
All Nginx installations I know of have this default include in the nginx.conf file distributed with all versions.

```text
Checking url: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mitchellkrogza/nginx-ultimate-bad-bot-blocker/master/include_filelist.txt

** Dry Run ** | not updating files | run  as 'setup-ngxblocker -x' to setup files.

Whitelisting ip:  x.x.x.x  => /etc/nginx/bots.d/whitelist-ips.conf
```

This script also whitelists your IP in the whitelist-ips.conf file for you. 
Further IP's or IP ranges can be added to your customizable whitelits-ips.conf file located in /etc/nginx/bots.d/whitelist-ips.conf.

**setup-ngxblocker, install-ngxblocker and update-ngxblocker can all be configured with custom installation / update locations from the command line.** 

**Run any of the setup, install or update scripts with --help or -h to view options.**


************************************************
<img src=""https://github.com/mitchellkrogza/nginx-ultimate-bad-bot-blocker/blob/master/.assets/step-5.png""/>

Now run the setup script with the -x parameter to make all the necessary changes to your nginx.conf (if required) and also to add the required includes into all your vhost files. 

This setup-ngxblocker script assumes that all your vhost files located in /etc/nginx/sites-available end in an extension .vhost. It is good practice to make all your vhost config files end with a .vhost extension but if you prefer to stick what you already have eg .conf you can simply modify run setup-ngxblocker using the `-e` parameter to specify the extension you use for your vhost files.

For instance if your vhost files end in .conf you will change this execute setup-ngxblocker with an additional command line parameter as follows:

`sudo ./setup-ngxblocker -x -e conf`

So now let's run the setup script and let it make all the changes we need to make the Bot Blocker active on all your sites.

```sh
cd /usr/local/sbin/
sudo ./setup-ngxblocker -x
```

You will see output as follows:

```text
Checking url: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mitchellkrogza/nginx-ultimate-bad-bot-blocker/master/include_filelist.txt

INFO:      /etc/nginx/conf.d/* detected               => /etc/nginx/nginx.conf

Whitelisting ip:  x.x.x.x  => /etc/nginx/bots.d/whitelist-ips.conf
```

You will note it has done the includes in all the .vhost files on my test bed server and also whitelisted your own IP address in the whitelist-ips.conf file for you. Further IP's or IP ranges can be added to your customizable whitelits-ips.conf file located in /etc/nginx/bots.d/whitelist-ips.conf.

What this setup script has done has simply added the following include statements into your .vhost files for you, it also adds /etc/nginx/conf.d/* to the includes in nginx.conf (if not already in nginx.conf), otherwise, the whole script will fail.

```nginx
# Bad Bot Blocker
include /etc/nginx/bots.d/ddos.conf;
include /etc/nginx/bots.d/blockbots.conf;
```

**setup-ngxblocker, install-ngxblocker and update-ngxblocker can all be configured with custom installation / update locations from the command line.** 

**Run any of the setup, install or update scripts with --help or -h to view options.**

************************************************
<img src=""https://github.com/mitchellkrogza/nginx-ultimate-bad-bot-blocker/blob/master/.assets/step-6.png""/>

Now test your nginx configuration

`sudo nginx -t`

and you should see

```text
nginx: the configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf syntax is ok
nginx: configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf test is successful
```

************************************************
<img src=""https://github.com/mitchellkrogza/nginx-ultimate-bad-bot-blocker/blob/master/.assets/step-7.png""/>

Now simply reload / restart Nginx and the Bot Blocker will immediately be active and protecting all your web sites.

`sudo nginx -t && sudo nginx -s reload`

or

`sudo service nginx restart`

That's it, the blocker is now active and protecting your sites from thousands of malicious bots and domains.

************************************************
<img src=""https://github.com/mitchellkrogza/nginx-ultimate-bad-bot-blocker/blob/master/.assets/step-8.png""/>

Now setup cron to automatically update the blocker for you every day so you always have the latest up to date protection.

`sudo crontab -e`

Add the following line at the end of your crontab file. Note adding the `-e` command line parameter to specify your email address where the update report is sent to. Obviously substitute `yourname@youremail.com` with your real email address or you will not receive the email when the script has updated.

`00 22 * * * sudo /usr/local/sbin/update-ngxblocker -e yourname@youremail.com` 

This will update the blocker every night for you at 10 PM.

If you want it to update more frequently (as sometimes I push out 3-4 updates a day) you can set it as follows to run the cron every 8 hours, although just once a day is more than enough.

`00 */8 * * * sudo /usr/local/sbin/update-ngxblocker -e yourname@youremail.com`       

If you don't want any email notification after an update (not advisable in case Nginx ever has an EMERG when reloading), then simply run your cron as follows. 

`00 */8 * * * sudo /usr/local/sbin/update-ngxblocker -n`       

If you would rather send e-mail via <a href=""https://www.mailgun.com/"">mailgun</a> then run your cron as so:

`00 22 * * * sudo /usr/local/sbin/update-ngxblocker -g yourname@yourdomain.com -d yourdomain.com -a mailgun api key -f from@yourdomain.com`

That's it, the blocker will automatically keep itself up to date and also reload Nginx once it has downloaded the latest version of the globalblacklist.conf file.

************************************************
<img src=""https://github.com/mitchellkrogza/nginx-ultimate-bad-bot-blocker/blob/master/.assets/step-9.png""/>

You can now customize any of the following files below to suit your environment or requirements. These include files never get modified during an update using the auto update script above so whatever customizations you do here will never be overwritten during an update.

```text
/etc/nginx/bots.d/whitelist-ips.conf
/etc/nginx/bots.d/whitelist-domains.conf
/etc/nginx/bots.d/blockbots.conf
/etc/nginx/bots.d/blacklist-domains.conf
/etc/nginx/bots.d/blacklist-user-agents.conf
/etc/nginx/bots.d/blacklist-ips.conf
/etc/nginx/bots.d/bad-referrer-words.conf
/etc/nginx/bots.d/custom-bad-referrers.conf
/etc/nginx/bots.d/ddos.conf
```

Let's say for some ""obscure"" reason you actually want to block GoogleBot from accessing your site. You would simply add it to the /etc/nginx/bots.d/blacklist-user-agents.conf file and it will over-ride the default whitelist for GoogleBot. the same applies to any other bots that are whitelisted by default.

All include files are commented for your convenience.

(TEST THAT IT IS WORKING)

**TESTING**

Run the following commands one by one from a terminal on another linux machine against your own domain name. 

:exclamation: 
**substitute http:// yourdomain.com :exclamation: in the examples below with your own REAL domain name :exclamation:**

`curl -A ""Mozilla/5.0 (Linux; Android 6.0.1; Nexus 5X Build/MMB29P) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/41.0.2272.96 Mobile Safari/537.36 (compatible; Googlebot/2.1; +http://www.google.com/bot.html)"" -I http://yourdomain.com`

`curl -A ""Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; bingbot/2.0; +http://www.bing.com/bingbot.htm)"" -I http://yourdomain.com`

**Should respond with 200 OK**

- curl: (56) TCP connection reset by peer
- curl: (92) HTTP/2 stream 0 was not closed cleanly: PROTOCOL_ERROR (err 1)

The Nginx Ultimate Bot Blocker is now WORKING and PROTECTING your web sites !!!

<img src=""https://github.com/mitchellkrogza/nginx-ultimate-bad-bot-blocker/blob/master/.assets/nginx-ultimate-bad-bot-blocker-testing-instructions.jpg""/>

### NOTE to Cloudflare Users !!!

If you are a Cloudflare user who is using the Cloudflare CDN / Caching System you should always disable the Cloudflare CDN (set gray Cloud)

While testing you will get the correct response codes  results as below:
- curl: (52) Empty reply from server
- curl: (56) TCP connection reset by peer
- curl: (92) HTTP/2 stream 0 was not closed cleanly: PROTOCOL_ERROR (err 1)

This is by design. The CDN is doing its work, meaning, the first response from your server said to the bot, ""go away"" by issuing it `444` or `443` responses.

Cloudflare cache's that response and hence the second time you test you will get served a `520 Origin Error` origin error message.

While testing the blocker, disable the CDN / cacheing system and once you are happy with your tests, re-enable the CDN/Cache on your live environment as you do want the bots to get that response from Cloudflare. 

Most other CDN systems will probably show the same behavior so always disable a CDN during testing to rule out anything that will interfere with your testing. Always make sure to re-enable the CDN when done testing !!

Once you Enable Cloudflare CDN, test again.

While testing, you get
- curl: 520 Origin Error 

This means the CDN is working.

#### OPTIONAL
**INSTALLING THE BLOCKER TO NON-STANDARD NGINX FOLDER LOCATIONS**

Some people build Nginx themselves and do not end up having the standard nginx folder locations at `/etc/nginx`

For users like this you can run the install-ngxblocker, setup-ngxblocker and update-ngxblocker specifying your
folder location in the command lines as follows.

`sudo ./install-ngxblocker -x -c /usr/local/nginx/conf.d -b /usr/local/nginx/bots.d`

`sudo ./setup-ngxblocker -x -c /usr/local/nginx/conf.d -b /usr/local/nginx/bots.d`

`sudo ./update-ngxblocker -c /usr/local/nginx/conf.d -b /usr/local/nginx/bots.d -e yourname@youremail.com`

This will automatically put the files into the locations you specify, it will do the includes into your vhosts using your custom locations  and when update-ngxblocker pulls a new update it will also now automatically re-write the ""Include"" sections inside the globalblacklist.conf file your own custom locations. Thanks again to Stuart Cardall @itoffshore for his contributions of these excellent scripts.

************************************************
## Welcome to the Ultimate Nginx Bad Bot, User-Agent, Spam Referrer Blocker, Adware, Malware and Ransomware Blocker, Click-Jacking Blocker, Click-Redirect Blocker and Bad IP Blocker with Anti DDOS System, Nginx Rate Limiting and Wordpress Theme Detector Blocking.

Bots attempt to make themselves look like other software or web sites by disguising their user agent.  Their user agent names may look harmless, perfectly legitimate even. 

For example, ""^Java"" but according to Project Honeypot, it's actually one of the most dangerous BUT a lot of legitimate bots out there have ""Java"" in their user agent string so the approach taken by many to block ""Java"" is not only ignorant but also blocking out very legitimate crawlers including some of Google's and Bing's and makes it very clear to me that those people writing bot blocking scripts seldom ever test them. 

Spam Referrers and Spam Domain Names use very clever techniques to hop off your sites running very lucrative click-jacking and click-redirecting campaigns which serve ads to unsuspecting people browsing the web or even planting malware, adware or ransomware into their browsers which then become part of their lucrative network of bots. 

This Bot Blocker includes hundreds of domain names and IP addresses that most people will not even see in their Nginx logs. This comes as a result of all my sites running of SSL and using Content-Security-Policy (CSP) which blocks things before they even get to Nginx and I have picked up and continue to pick up some of the worst domains and bots out there. 

A massive amount of Porn, Gambling and Fake News web sites are also blocked in this blocker script which also grows at a rapid pace.

Unfortunately most bot blocker scripts out there are simply copy and pasted from other people's scripts and made  to look like their own work. This one  was inspired by the one created by https://github.com/mariusv and I  contributed to that project but went off into a totally new layout, cleaned it up big time and started from scratch. It is now a completely independent project. It's clean, it works and has been thoroughly tested.

************************************************
### THE BASICS

This nginx bad bot bot blocker list is designed to be a global Nginx include file and uses the Nginx map $http_user_agent, map $http_referer and geo $validate_client directives.

This way the .conf file is loaded once into memory by Nginx and is available to all web sites that you operate. You simply need to use an Include statement in an Nginx vhost conf file.

************************************************
### IT'S CENTRALISED:

The beauty of this is that it is one central file used by all your web sites. This means there is only place to make amendments ie. adding new bots that you discover in your log files. Any changes are applied immediately to all sites after a simple ""sudo service nginx reload"". But of course always do a sudo nginx -t to test any config changes before you reload.

************************************************
### IT IS TINY AND LIGHTWEIGHT

The file is tiny in size. At the time of this writing and the first public commit of this the file size including all the commenting ""which nginx ignores"" currently at **a mere 185 kb in size** and already containing over 5000 bad domains, bad bots and bad IP addresses. It is so lightweight that Nginx does not even know it's there. It already contains thousands of entries - total updated at the top of this README. 

************************************************
### IT IS ACCURATE AND IS FALSE POSITIVE PROOF

Unlike many other bad bot blockers out there for Nginx and Apache where people simply copy and paste lists from others, this list has been built from the ground up and tested thoroughly and I mean thoroughly for now over 10 months. It comes from actual server logs that are monitored daily and there are at least 3-10 new additions to this file almost daily.

It has also been throughly tested for false positives using months of constant and regular testing and monitoring of log files. 

All web sites listed in the bad referers are checked one by one before they are even added. Simply copying  anything that look suspicious in your log file and adding it to a blocker like this without actually seeing  what it is first .... well it's foolish to say the least.

************************************************
### DROP THEM AND THAT'S IT

Nginx has a lovely error called 444 which just literally drops the connection. All these rules issue a 444 response so if a rule matches, the requesting IP simply get's no response and it would appear that your  server does not exist to them or appears to be offline. 

A test with curl using one of the test command line's documented in the /conf.d/globalblacklist.conf file will give a simple ""curl: (52) Empty reply from server"" and that's the reply the bad referrers and bots get.

************************************************
### RATE LIMITING FUNCTIONALITY BUILT IN

For bot's or spiders that you still want to allow but want to limit their visitation rate, you can use the  built in rate limiting functions I have included. The file is extensively commented throughout so you should figure it out otherwise simply message me if you are having problems.

## FEATURES OF THE NGINX BAD BOT BLOCKER:

- Extensive Lists of Bad and Known Bad Bots and Scrapers (updated almost daily)
- Blocking of Spam Referrer Domains and Web Sites
- Blocking of SEO data collection companies like Semalt.com, Builtwith.com, WooRank.com and many others (updated regularly)
- Blocking of clickjacking Sites linked to Adware, Malware and Ransomware
- Blocking of Porn and Gambling Web Sites who use Lucrative Ways to Earn Money through Serving Ads by hopping off your domain names and web sites.
- Blocking of Bad Domains and IP's that you cannot even see in your Nginx Logs. Thanks to the Content Security Policy (CSP) on all my SSL sites I can see things trying to pull resources off my sites before they even get to Nginx and get blocked by the CSP.
- Anti DDOS Filter and Rate Limiting of Agressive Bots
- Alphabetically ordered for easier maintenance (Pull Requests Welcomed)
- Commented sections of certain important bots to be sure of before blocking
- Includes the IP range of Cyveillance who are known to ignore robots.txt rules
  and snoop around all over the Internet.
- Whitelisting of Google, Bing and Cloudflare IP Ranges
- Whitelisting of your own IP Ranges that you want to avoid blocking by mistake.
- Ability to add other IP ranges and IP blocks that you want to block out.
- If its out there and it's bad it's already in here and BLOCKED !!

************************************************
### UNDERSTANDS PUNYCODE / IDN DOMAIN NAMES

A lot of lists out there put funny domains into their hosts file. Your hosts file and DNS will not understand this. This list uses converted domains which are in the correct DNS format to be understood by any operating system. **Avoid using lists** that do not put the correctly formatted domain structure into their lists.

For instance
The domain:

`lifehacĸer.com` (note the K)

actually translates to:

`xn--lifehacer-1rb.com`

You can do an nslookup on any operating system and it will resolve correctly.

`nslookup xn--lifehacer-1rb.com`

```xn--lifehacer-1rb.com
	origin = dns1.yandex.net
	mail addr = iskalko.yandex.ru
	serial = 2016120703
	refresh = 14400
	retry = 900
	expire = 1209600
	minimum = 14400
xn--lifehacer-1rb.com	mail exchanger = 10 mx.yandex.net.
Name:	xn--lifehacer-1rb.com
Address: 78.110.60.230
xn--lifehacer-1rb.com	nameserver = dns2.yandex.net.
xn--lifehacer-1rb.com	text = ""v=spf1 redirect=_spf.yandex.net""
xn--lifehacer-1rb.com	nameserver = dns1.yandex.net.
```

- Look at: https://www.charset.org/punycode for more info on this.

************************************************
## ALWAYS MONITOR WHAT YOU ARE DOING:

**MAKE SURE to monitor your web site logs** after implementing this. I suggest you first load this into one site and monitor it for any possible false positives before putting this into production on all your web sites.

Do not sit like an ostrich with your head in the sand, being a responsible server operator and web site owner means you must monitor your logs frequently. A reason many of you ended up here in the first place because you saw nasty looking stuff in your Nginx log files.
 
Also monitor your logs daily for new bad referers and user-agent strings that you want to block. Your best source of adding to this list is your own server logs, not mine.
 
Feel free to contribute bad referers from your own logs to this project by sending a Pull Request (PR). You can however rely on this list to keep out 99% of the baddies out there.
 
************************************************
## HOW TO MONITOR YOUR LOGS DAILY (The Easy Way):

**With great thanks and appreciation to**

https://blog.nexcess.net/2011/01/21/one-liners-for-apache-log-files/

To monitor your top referer's for a web site's log file's on a daily basis use the following simple cron jobs which will email you a list of top referer's / user agents every morning from a particular web site's log files. This is an example for just one cron job for one site. Set up multiple one's for each one you want to monitor. Here is a cron that runs at 8am every morning and emails me the stripped down log of referers. When I say stripped down, the domain of the site and other referers like Google and Bing are stripped from the results. Of course you must change the log file name, domain name and your email address in the examples below. The second cron for collecting User agents does not do any stripping out of any referers but you can add that functionality if you like copying the awk statement !~ from the first example.

##### Cron for Monitoring Daily Referers on Nginx

`00 08 * * * tail -10000 /var/log/nginx/mydomain-access.log | awk '$11 !~ /google|bing|yahoo|yandex|mywebsite.com/' | awk '{print $11}' | tr -d '""' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head -1000 | mail -s ""Top 1000 Referers for Mydomain.com"" me@mydomain.com`

This emails you a daily list of referrers using an awk command to exclude domains like google, bing and your own domain name.

##### Cron for Monitoring Daily User Agents on Nginx

`00 08 * * * tail -50000 /var/log/nginx/mydomain-access.log | awk '{print $12}' | tr -d '""' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head -1000 | mail -s ""Top 1000 Agents for Mydomain.com"" me@mydomain.com`

This emails you a list of top User-Agents who visited your site in the last 24 hours, helpful for spotting any rogue or suspicious looking User-Agents strings.

## BLOCK AGGRESSIVE BOTS AT FIREWALL LEVEL USING FAIL2BAN:

I have added a custom Fail2Ban filter and action that I have written which monitors your Nginx logs for bots that generate a large number of 444 errors. This custom jail for Fail2Ban will scan logs over a 1 week period and ban the offender for 24 hours.
It helps a great deal in keeping out some repeat offenders and preventing them from filling up your log files with 444 errors.
See the Fail2Ban folder for instructions on configuring this great add on for the Nginx Bad Bot Blocker.

************************************************
## STOPPING GOOGLE ANALYTICS ""GHOST"" SPAM:

Simply using the Nginx blocker does not stop Google Analytics ghost referral spam because they are hitting Analytics directly and not always necessarily touching your website. 

You should use regex filters in Analytics to prevent ghost referral spam.

For this there are several google-exclude-0*.txt files which have been created for you and they are updated at the same time when the Nginx Blocker is updated. As the list grows there will be more exclude files created.

************************************************
## TO STOP ""GHOST"" SPAM ON GOOGLE ANALYTICS FOLLOW THE SIMPLE VISUAL GUIDE BELOW

Follow the step by step visual instructions below to add these google-exclude files as segments to your web site.

## BLOCKING SPAM DOMAINS USING GOOGLE SEARCH CONSOLE / WEBMASTER TOOLS 
(How to use the google-disavow.txt file)

I have added the creation of a Google Disavow text file called google-disavow.txt. This file can be used in Google's Webmaster Tools to block all these domains out as spammy or bad links. Use with caution.

************************************************
## ROBOTS.txt VERSION for those who cannot use this full blocker?

Lots of people are at the peril of their hosting company and do not have root access to the server running behind their web site. If this is your situation check out the automatically generated robots.txt file which will help you to some degree to keep a lot of Bad Bots and User-Agents out of your sites.

************************************************
## .htaccess VERSIONS for those who cannot use this full blocker?

Lots of people are at the peril of their hosting company and do not have root access to the server running behind their web site. 

If this is your situation check out the automatically generated .htaccess versions of the Spam Referrer Blocker which can be found in <a href=""https://github.com/mitchellkrogza/apache-ultimate-bad-bot-blocker/tree/master/.htaccess"">this repository</a> this .htaccess method (FOR APACHE SITES ONLY) will help you to keep all the Spam Referrers in this blocker out of your site. 

This is merely mentioned here as a lot of people using CPanel systems think they are sitting behind an Nginx server but in reality are actually running on an Apache Server sitting behind an Nginx Proxy Server. .htaccess does not work on Nginx sites.

Not Using Nginx Web Server? See the [![Get the APACHE ULTIMATE BAD BOT BLOCKER](https://img.shields.io/badge/APACHE%20-%20ULTIMATE%20BAD%20BOT%20BLOCKER%20%E2%9B%94-blue.svg)](https://github.com/mitchellkrogza/apache-ultimate-bad-bot-blocker)

211,211,osdnk/react-native-reanimated-bottom-sheet,TypeScript,"# Reanimated Bottom Sheet
Highly configurable component imitating [native bottom sheet behavior](https://material.io/design/components/sheets-bottom.html#standard-bottom-sheet), with fully native 60 FPS animations!

Built from scratch with [react-native-gesture-handler](https://github.com/kmagiera/react-native-gesture-handler) and [react-native-reanimated](https://github.com/kmagiera/react-native-reanimated).

Usable with Expo with no extra native dependencies!

![](gifs/1.gif)  |  ![](gifs/2.gif) |  ![](gifs/3.gif)  |  ![](gifs/4.gif)  |
:---------------:|:----------------:|:-----------------:|:-----------------:|


## Installation

Open a Terminal in the project root and run:

```sh
yarn add reanimated-bottom-sheet
```

Or if you use npm:

```sh
npm install reanimated-bottom-sheet
```

Now we need to install [`react-native-gesture-handler`](https://github.com/kmagiera/react-native-gesture-handler) and [`react-native-reanimated`](https://github.com/kmagiera/react-native-reanimated).

If you are using Expo, to ensure that you get the compatible versions of the libraries, run:

```sh
expo install react-native-gesture-handler react-native-reanimated
```

If you are not using Expo, run the following:

```sh
yarn add react-native-reanimated react-native-gesture-handler
```

Or if you use npm:

```sh
npm install react-native-reanimated react-native-gesture-handler
```

We're done! Now you can build and run the app on your device/simulator.

## Usage

```javascript
import * as React from 'react';
import { StyleSheet, Text, View, Button } from 'react-native';
import Animated from 'react-native-reanimated';
import BottomSheet from 'reanimated-bottom-sheet';

export default function App() {
  const renderContent = () => (
    <View
      style={{
        backgroundColor: 'white',
        padding: 16,
        height: 450,
      }}
    >
      <Text>Swipe down to close</Text>
    </View>
  );

  const sheetRef = React.useRef(null);

  return (
    <>
      <View
        style={{
          flex: 1,
          backgroundColor: 'papayawhip',
          alignItems: 'center',
          justifyContent: 'center',
        }}
      >
        <Button
          title=""Open Bottom Sheet""
          onPress={() => sheetRef.current.snapTo(0)}
        />
      </View>
      <BottomSheet
        ref={sheetRef}
        snapPoints={[450, 300, 0]}
        borderRadius={10}
        renderContent={renderContent}
      />
    </>
  );
}
```

## Methods

### `snapTo(index)`

Imperative method on for snapping to snap point in given index. E.g.

```javascript
// Snap to the snap point at index 0 (e.g. 450 in [450, 300, 0])
this.bottomSheetRef.current.snapTo(0)
```

Here `this.bottomSheetRef` refers [to the `ref`](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-api.html#reactcreateref) passed to the `BottomSheet` component.

## Example

More complex examples can be found in the `Example` folder. To view the examples in the [Expo app](https://expo.io/), open a Terminal and run:

```sh
yarn
yarn prepare
cd Example
yarn
expo start
```

The example app is also available on [Expo](https://expo.io/@osdnk/reanimated-bottomsheet-expample).

## Todo

It's not finished and some work has to be done yet.

1. Play with magic config values
2. Horizontal mode
3. Deal with GH in inner scrollView
4. Cleanup code (e.g. measuring of components)

"
212,212,out386/aria-telegram-mirror-bot,TypeScript,"# aria-telegram-mirror-bot

This is a Telegram bot that uses [aria2](https://github.com/aria2/aria2) to download files over BitTorrent / HTTP(S) and uploads them to your Google Drive. This can be useful for downloading from slow servers. Parallel downloading and download queuing are supported. There are some features to try to reduce piracy.

## Limitations

This bot is meant to be used in small, closed groups. So, once deployed, it only works in whitelisted groups.

## Warning

There is very little preventing users from using this to mirror pirated content. Hence, make sure that only trusted groups are whitelisted in `AUTHORIZED_CHATS`.

## Bot commands

* `/mirror <url>`: Download from the given URL and upload it to Google Drive. <url> can be HTTP(S), a BitTorrent magnet, or a HTTP(S) url to a BitTorrent .torrent file. A status message will be shown and updated while downloading.
* `/mirrorTar <url>`: Same as `/mirror`, but archive multiple files into a tar before uploading it.
* `/mirrorStatus`: Send a status message about all active and queued downloads.
* `/cancelMirror`: Cancel a particular mirroring task. To use this, send it as a reply to the message that started the download that you want to cancel. Only the person who started the task, SUDO_USERS, and chat admins can use this command.
* `/cancelAll`: Cancel all mirroring tasks in all chats if a [SUDO_USERS](#Constants-description) member uses it, or cancel all mirroring tasks for a particular chat if one of that chat's admins use it. No one else can use this command.
* `/list <filename>` : Send links to downloads with the `filename` substring in the name. In case of too many downloads, only show the most recent few. 
* `/getfolder` : Send link of drive mirror folder.

#### Notes

* **All commands except** `list` **can have the bot's username appended to them. See** `COMMANDS_USE_BOT_NAME` **under [constants description](#Constants-description).** This is useful if you have multiple instances of this bot in the same group.

* While creating a Telegram bot in the [pre-installation](#Pre-installation]) section below, you might want to add the above commands to your new bot by using `/setcommand` in BotFather, make sure all the commands are in lower case. This will cause a list of available bot commands to pop up in chats when you type `/`, and you can long press one of them to select it instead of typing out the entire command.

## Migrating from v1.0.0

Aria-telegram-mirror-bot is now written in TypeScript. If you are migrating from v1.0.0, move your existing `.constants.js` to `src/.constants.js`, and re-read the [installation section](#Installation) and the [section on updating](#Updating), as some steps have changed.

## Pre-installation

1. [Create a new bot](https://core.telegram.org/bots#3-how-do-i-create-a-bot) using Telegram's BotFather and copy your TOKEN.

2. Add the bot to your groups and optionally, give it the permission to delete messages. This permission is used to clean up status request messages from users. Not granting it will quickly fill the chat with useless messages from users.

3. Install [aria2](https://github.com/aria2/aria2).
   * For Ubuntu:
     `sudo apt install aria2`

4. Get Drive folder ID:

   * Visit [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com).
   * Create a new folder. The bot will upload files inside this folder.
   * Open the folder.
   * The URL will be something like `https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/012a_345bcdefghijk`. Copy the part after `folders/` (`012a_345bcdefghijk`). This is the `GDRIVE_PARENT_DIR_ID` that you'll need in step 5 of the Installation section.

## Installation

1. Clone the repo:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/out386/aria-telegram-mirror-bot
   cd aria-telegram-mirror-bot
   ```

3. Run `npm install`

4. Copy the example files:

   ```bash
   cp src/.constants.js.example src/.constants.js
   cp aria.sh.example aria.sh
   ```

5. Configure the aria2 startup script:

   * `nano aria.sh`
   * `ARIA_RPC_SECRET` is the secret (password) used to connect to aria2. Set this to whatever you want, and save the file with `ctrl + x`.
   * `MAX_CONCURRENT_DOWNLOADS` is the number of download jobs that can be active at the same time. Note that this does not affect the number of concurrent uploads. There is currently no limit for the number of concurrent uploads.

6. Configure the bot:

   * `nano src/.constants.js`
   * Now replace the placeholder values in this file with your values. Use the [Constants description](#Constants-description) section below for reference.

8. Set up OAuth:

   * Visit the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials)
   * Go to the OAuth Consent tab, fill it, and save.
   * Go to the Credentials tab and click Create Credentials -> OAuth Client ID
   * Choose Other and Create.
   * Use the download button to download your credentials.
   * Move that file to the root of aria-telegram-mirror-bot, and rename it to `client_secret.json`

9. Enable the Drive API:

   * Visit the [Google API Library](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/library) page.
   * Search for Drive.
   * Make sure that it's enabled. Enable it if not.

10. Start aria2 with `./aria.sh`

11. Start the bot with `npm start`

12. Open Telegram, and send `/mirror https://raw.githubusercontent.com/out386/aria-telegram-mirror-bot/master/README.md` to the bot.

11. In the terminal, it'll ask you to visit an authentication URL. Visit it, grant access, copy the code on that page, and paste it in the terminal.

That's it.

## Constants description

This is a description of the fields in src/.constants.js:

* `TOKEN`: This is the Telegram bot token that you will get from Botfather in step 1 of Pre-installation.
* `ARIA_SECRET`: This is the password used to connect to the aria2 RPC. You will get this from step 4 of Installation.
* `ARIA_DOWNLOAD_LOCATION`: This is the directory that aria2 will download files into, before uploading them. Make sure that there is no trailing ""/"" in this path. The suggested path is `/path/to/aria-telegram-mirror-bot/downloads`
* `ARIA_DOWNLOAD_LOCATION_ROOT`: This is the mountpoint that contains ARIA_DOWNLOAD_LOCATION. This is used internally to calculate the space available before downloading.
* `ARIA_FILTERED_DOMAINS`: The bot will refuse to download files from these domains. Can be an empty list.
* `ARIA_FILTERED_FILENAMES`: The bot will refuse to completely download (or if already downloaded, then upload) files with any of these substrings in the file/top level directory name. Can be an empty list or left undefined.
* `ARIA_PORT`: The port for the Aria2c RPC server. If you change this, make sure to update your aria.sh as well. Safe to leave this at the default value unless something else on your system is using that port.
* `GDRIVE_PARENT_DIR_ID`: This is the ID of the Google Drive folder that files will be uploaded into. You will get this from step 4 of Pre-installation.
* `SUDO_USERS`: This is a list of Telegram user IDs. These users can use the bot in any chat. Can be an empty list, if AUTHORIZED_CHATS is not empty.
* `AUTHORIZED_CHATS`: This is a list of Telegram Chat IDs. Anyone in these chats can use the bot in that particular chat. Anyone not in one of these chats and not in SUDO_USERS cannot use the bot. Someone in one of the chats in this list can use the bot only in that chat, not elsewhere. Can be an empty list, if SUDO_USERS is not empty.
* `STATUS_UPDATE_INTERVAL_MS`: Set the time in milliseconds between status updates. A smaller number will update status messages faster, but Telegram will rate limit the bot if it sends/edits more than around 20 messages/minute/chat. As that quota includes messages other than status updates, do not decrease this number if you get rate limit messages in the logs.
* `DRIVE_FILE_PRIVATE`: Files uploaded can either be visible to everyone (public), or be private.
  * `ENABLED`: Set this to `true` to make the uploaded files private. `false` makes uploaded files public.
  * `EMAILS`: An array of email addresses that read access will be granted to. Set this to `[]` to grant access only to the Drive user the bot is set up with.
* `DOWNLOAD_NOTIFY_TARGET`: The fields here are used to notify an external web server once a download is complete. See the [section on notifications below](#Notifying-an-external-webserver-on-download-completion) for details.
   * `enabled`: Set this to `true` to enable this feature.
   * `host`: The address of the web server to notify.
   * `port`: The server port ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
   * `path`: The server path ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
* `COMMANDS_USE_BOT_NAME`: The fields here decide whether to append the bot's usename to the end of commands or not. This works only for group chats, and gets ignored if you PM the bot.
  * `ENABLED`: If `true`, all bot commands have to have the bot's username (as below) appended to them. For example, `/mirror https://someweb.site/resource.tar` will become `/mirror@botName_bot https://someweb.site/resource.tar`. The only exception to this is the `/list` command, which will not have the bot's name appended. This allows having multiple non-conflicting mirror bots in the same group, and have them all reply to `/list`.
  * `NAME`: The username of the bot, as given in BotFather. Include the leading ""@"".
* `IS_TEAM_DRIVE`: Set to `true` if you are mirroring to a Shared Drive.

## Starting after installation

After the initial installation, use these instructions to (re)start the bot.

### Using tmux

1. Start aria2 by running `./aria.sh`
2. Start a new tmux session with `tmux new -s tgbot`, or connect to an existing session with `tmux a -t tgbot`. Running the bot inside tmux will let you disconnect from the server without terminating the bot. You can also use nohup instead.
3. Start the bot with `npm start`

### Using systemd

1. Install the systemd unit file `sudo cp -v contrib/mirror-bot.service /etc/systemd/system/`
2. Open `/etc/systemd/system/mirror-bot.service` with an editor of your choice and modify the path and user as per your environment.
3. Reload the systemctl daemon so it can see your new systemd unit `sudo systemctl daemon-reload`
4. Start the service `sudo systemctl start mirror-bot`
5. If you want the bot to automatically start on boot, run `sudo systemctl enable mirror-bot`

## Notifying an external webserver on download completion

This bot can make an HTTP request to an external web server once a download is complete. This can be when a download fails to start, fails to download, is cancelled, or completes successfully. See the section [on constants](#Constants-description) for details on how to configure it.

Your web server should listen for a POST request containing the following JSON data:

```
{
    'successful': boolean,
    'file': {
        'name': string,
        'driveURL': string,
        'size': string
    },
    originGroup: number
}
```

* `successful`: `true` if the download completed successfully, `false` otherwise
* `file`: Details about the file.
   * `name`: The name of the file. Might or might not be present if `successful` is `false`.
   * `driveURL`: The Google Drive download link to the downloaded file. Might or might not be present if `successful` is `false`.
   * `size`: A human-readable file size. Might or might not be present if `successful` is `false`.
* `originGroup`:  The Telegram chat ID for the chat the download was started in

If `successful` is false, any or all of the fields of `file` might be absent. However, if present, they are correct/reliable.

## Updating

Run `git pull`, then run `tsc`. After compilation has finished, you can start the bot as described in [the above section](#Starting-after-installation).

## Common issues

* **`tsc` silently dies, says, ""Killed"", or stays stuck forever:** Your machine does not have enough RAM. tsc needs at least 1GB. Increase your RAM if running on the cloud, or try  setting up a [swap](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-add-swap-space-on-ubuntu-16-04) with a high swappiness.

* **Trying to download anything gives a ""Failed to start the download. Unauthorized"" message:** [See #38](https://github.com/out386/aria-telegram-mirror-bot/issues/38). If it still doesn't work, something else might be running an aria2 RPC at the same port as the bot. Change [`ARIA_PORT`](#Constants-description) and try [#38](https://github.com/out386/aria-telegram-mirror-bot/issues/38) again.

* **`tsc` gives errors like `Property 'SOMETHING' does not exist on type<...>` with red lines under `constants.<...>`:** Some new configs were added to [constants](#Constants-description) after you set up the bot, but your existing `./src/.constants.js` does not have them. Re-read [the constants section](#Constants-description), and add whatever property was added. Usually, you can also just ignore these particular errors and keep using the bot, because `tsc` will compile anyway, and there are default options that are used if you did not update your `.constants.js`.

* **Cannot get public links for folders if using Shared Drives**: Shared Drives do not support sharing folders to non members. The download link the bot gives only works for members of the Shared drive. If you need public links, use `/mirrorTar` to mirror the folder as a single file instead.  
<font size=2>This feature is planned. See [upcoming releases](https://support.google.com/a/table/7539891) (search for ""Folder sharing in shared drives"").</font>

Lorem ipsum i am too lazy figure what it does yourself

You might be lazy too so here ya go:

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/patheticGeek/torrent-aio-bot)

Please dont start a test torrent download on my website it works you dont need to just wastes my drive space. Be careful when adding torrents to my deployment as it is deployed everytime i commit code here so your downloads may be interrupted.

#### The search section is currently unmaintained due to the inconsistency between proxy sites and their uptimes

## TODO after deploy

### To disable website

If you only want telegram bot to be workinh set value of DISABLE_WEB env var to true.

### To get torrent download working:

Set a variable with key ""SITE"" and value is the link of your site. eg. ""https://\<project name>.herokuapp.com"". This is important to keep bot alive or server will stop after 30 min of inactivity.

### To start a torrent bot:

Set a enviorment variable with key ""TELEGRAM_TOKEN"" and token of your bot as value. [How to get token](https://core.telegram.org/bots/#creating-a-new-bot)
To set a enviorment variable go to heroku dashboard open the app then go to Settings > Config vars > Reveal Config vars.

### To get search working:

The library used for web scrapping the torrent sites requires a custom buildpack on heroku. By default the search will happen on your deployment and you will need to configure the buildpack as described below. But if you don't want to do that you can specify and env SEARCH_SITE and set value to https://torrent-aio-bot.herokuapp.com/ . The frwd slash at end is necessary. This will make all the searches go thru my deployment and you don't need to configure buildpack.

Go to the build packs section in settings and click add buildpack and enter ""https://github.com/jontewks/puppeteer-heroku-buildpack.git"" as buildpack url then click save changes. And then do a dummy git commit so that heroku will buid it using the buildpack this time. Then set the SEARCH_SITE env to same value as SITE.

### To get gdrive upload:

1. Go to https://developers.google.com/drive/api/v3/quickstart/nodejs and click on Enable the Drive API
   copy client id and set an enviorment variable in heroku with name CLIENT_ID then copy client secret and set another env named CLIENT_SECRET.
2. Goto https://\<project name>.herokuapp.com/drivehelp and paste your client id and secret and click ""Get auth code"", it will redirect you to login and you'll get a auth code after login paste that auth code in the auth code feild and click ""Generate token"" it'll give you a token. now set these as env variable CLIENT_ID, CLIENT_SECRET, AUTH_CODE and TOKEN.
3. By default files are uploaded in the root of drive if you dont want to upload in root folder make a folder copy its id and set a env var GDRIVE_PARENT_FOLDER and value id of desired folder. The folder id will be the last part of the url such as in url ""https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1rpk7tGWs_lv_kZ_W4EPaKj8brfFVLOH-"" the folder id is ""1rpk7tGWs_lv_kZ_W4EPaKj8brfFVLOH-"".
4. If you want team drive support open your teamdrive and copy the folder id from url eg. https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/0ABZHZpfYfdVCUk9PVA this is link of a team drive copy the last part ""0ABZHZpfYfdVCUk9PVA"" this will be your GDRIVE_PARENT_FOLDER. If you want them in a folder in teamdrive open the folder and use that folder's id instead.
5. You're good to go. The gdrive status will be shown in gdrive.txt file when you click Open on the website downloads page. Bot wil automatically send you drive link when its uploaded.

> Use this torrent for testing or when downloading to setup drive it is well seeded and downloads in ~10s
>
> magnet:?xt=urn:btih:dd8255ecdc7ca55fb0bbf81323d87062db1f6d1c&dn=Big+Buck+Bunny

## Changing the sites used for searching

To change the pirate bay site, visit the site you would like to use search something there, copy the url eg. https://thepiratebay.org/search/whatisearched and replace the search with {term} so the url looks like https://thepiratebay.org/search/{term} ans set this to env var PIRATEBAY_SITE

Same, if you want to change the limetorrents site visit the site you want to use and search for something, then replace the thing you searched for with {term} so final url looks like https://limetorrents.at/search?search={term} and set this value to env var LIMETORRENT_SITE

Simillarly the enviorment variable for 1337x is O337X_SITE

## API Endpoints

Prefix: https://\<project name>.herokuapp.com/api/v1

### For downloading:

| Endpoint          |    Params    |                                                                Return |

There are also other packages maintained by our community, like Fedora, 
[AUR (bottles-git)](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/bottles-git/), [CachyOS AUR](https://github.com/CachyOS/linux-cachyos#we-are-providing-a-repo-which-includes-all-kernels-in-generic-v3-and-generic-and-more-optimized-packages), and MX Linux.

Read [here](https://docs.usebottles.com/getting-started/installation) how to
install Bottles on your distribution.

### Notices for package maintainers
We are happy to see packaged Bottles but we ask you to respect some small rules:
- The package must be `bottles`, in other distributions it is possible to use suffixes (e.g. `bottles-git` on Arch Linux for the git based package) while on others the RDNN format is required (e.g. `com.usebottles.bottles` on elementary OS and Flathub repository). All other nomenclatures are discouraged.
- In the current development phase, the version corresponds to the formula (`2.commit`, e.g. 2.a005f01), where possible use this formula throughout the development phase. For stable and 'stable development' release you can use the version in the VERSION file and its release. Please don't travel into the future with releases. It might confuse users.
- Do not package external files and do not make changes to the code, no hard script. Obviously with the exception of files essential for packaging.
Once the package is published, you can open a [Pull Request](https://github.com/bottlesdevs/Bottles/pulls) to add it to the packages table above! Thanks :heart:!

## The new BF CLI replaces legacy standalone tools

The Bot Framework SDK team is happy to announce the General Availability of the consolidated bot framework CLI tool [bf-cli](https://aka.ms/bfcli). The new BF CLI tool will replace legacy standalone tools to manage Bot Framework bots and related services. The old tools will be ported over in phases and all new features, bug fixes, and further investments will focus on the new BF CLI.  Old tools will still work for the time being, but they are going to be deprecated in future releases.

Upon the release of Bot Framework SDK version 4.6 the following legacy tools have been ported: Chatdown, QnAMaker, LuisGen, and LuDown.  Dispatch CLI is on the path to be deprecated and replaced with [Orchestrator](https://aka.ms/bf-orchestrator).

To learn more about the BF CLI please visit the [BF CLI github repository](https://aka.ms/bfcli).

__The following page is about the legacy tools.__

# Bot Framework Tools 
[![Build Status](https://fuselabs.visualstudio.com/SDK_v4/_apis/build/status/Tools/Botbuilder-tools-js-daily?branchName=master)](https://fuselabs.visualstudio.com/SDK_v4/_build/latest?definitionId=467&branchName=master) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/Microsoft/botbuilder-tools/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/Microsoft/botbuilder-tools?branch=master) [![lerna](https://img.shields.io/badge/maintained%20with-lerna-cc00ff.svg)](https://lernajs.io/)

The Bot Framework tools are a collection of cross-platform command line tools designed to cover end-to-end bot development workflow. This repo is part of the [Microsoft Bot Framework](https://github.com/Microsoft/botframework) -  a comprehensive framework for building enterprise-grade conversational AI experiences.

## Install CLI tools:
Pre-requisite:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) version 10.14.1 or higher
- [.NET Core SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download) version 2.1.403 or higher

```
npm install -g chatdown msbot ludown luis-apis qnamaker botdispatch luisgen
```

## Overview

- Please see [here](https://aka.ms/BotBuilderOverview) for an overview of the end-to-end bot development workflow.
- Please see [here](./tools-overview.md) for an overview of using Bot Builder tools throughout various phases of bot development.

Bot Builder tools are designed to work with
- Bot Builder V4 SDK - [C# SDK](https://github.com/microsoft/botbuilder-dotnet), [JS SDK](https://github.com/microsoft/botbuilder-js)
- [Bot Builder V3 SDK](https://github.com/microsoft/botbuilder-v3)
- [Bot Framework Emulator V4](https://github.com/Microsoft/BotFramework-Emulator/releases)

Before writing code, review the [bot design guidelines](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/bot-service-design-principles) for best practices and identify the needs for your bot: will a basic bot be enough or whether it should have more sophisticated capabilities, such as speech, language understanding, QnA, or the ability to extract knowledge from different sources and provide intelligent answers. This is also the phase where you might want to create mockup of conversations between the user and the bot for the specific scenarios your bot will support. [Chatdown](https://github.com/Microsoft/botbuilder-tools/tree/master/packages/Chatdown) is the tool built for this purpose. You can author .chat files that mockup the conversations and then use chatdown CLI to convert them into rich transcripts.

As you build your bot, you may also need to integrate AI services like [LUIS.ai](http://luis.ai) for language understanding, [QnAMaker.ai](http://qnamaker.ai) for your bot to respond to simple questions in a Q&A format, and more. You can bootstrap language understanding for your bot using [LUDown](https://github.com/Microsoft/botbuilder-tools/tree/master/packages/Ludown).

The tools are designed to work together. You can then use [LUIS](https://github.com/Microsoft/botbuilder-tools/tree/master/packages/LUIS) CLI and/or the [QnAMaker](https://github.com/Microsoft/botbuilder-tools/tree/master/packages/QnAMaker) CLI tools to create your LUIS.ai models and QnAMaker knowledge base.

As your bot grows in sophistication, [Dispatch](https://github.com/Microsoft/botbuilder-tools/tree/master/packages/Dispatch) CLI can help create and evaluate LUIS models used to dispatch intent across multiple bot modules such as LUIS models, QnA knowledge bases and others (added to dispatch as a file type).

Throughout the Build phase, you can use [MSBot](https://github.com/Microsoft/botbuilder-tools/tree/master/packages/MSBot) CLI to create and keep your bot configuration file updated with all relevant service references.

To test and refine your bot, you can use the new [V4 Bot Framework Emulator](https://github.com/Microsoft/BotFramework-Emulator/releases). The Bot Framework Emulator is a cross-platform [Electron](https://electronjs.org/) application that enables you to test and debug your bots on local machine or in the cloud. The new emulator includes features like faster load times, an improved dynamic layout model, support for multiple bot configurations, simple bot components management, and the ability to inspect responses from connected services such as LUIS and QnA. The Bot Framework Emulator also deepens links to different parts used by the bot. The Bot Framework Emulator new functionality enables you to debug bots based on transcript logs and to view previous chat in presentation mode. The Bot Framework Emulator is available as open source on [Github](https://github.com/Microsoft/BotFramework-Emulator).

With the [Azure CLI Bot extension](./AzureCli), you can create, download, publish, configure channels with the [Azure Bot Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/bot-service/). Azure CLI Bot extension requires [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest) (version 2.0.45 or higher]

## Building the tools

In order to build the SDK, ensure that you have [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed.

Run the following commands to build all tools.

```
npm install
npm run build
```

Run the following command to verify your installation.

```
npm run test
```

This repository uses [lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna) to manage the packages included. This allows you to execute scripts for all packages or only for some packages. For instance, `lerna run test` will run all tests in each package, but `lerna run test --scope chatdown` will run the tests of chatdown.

To use lerna, install it as a global package with `npm install lerna --global`.



## Nightly builds

Nightly builds are generated using the latest code. Therefore, they may not be stable, and most likely lack up to date documentation. These builds are better suited for more experienced users, although everyone is welcome to use them and provide feedback.

You can get the latest nightly build of MSBot from the [BotBuilder MyGet](https://botbuilder.myget.org/gallery) feed. To install the nightly -

```shell
npm config set registry https://botbuilder.myget.org/F/botbuilder-tools-daily/npm/
```

Install using npm:
```shell
npm i -g chatdown msbot ludown luis-apis qnamaker botdispatch luisgen
```

To reset registry:
```shell
npm config set registry https://registry.npmjs.org/
```

This repository contains code for the JavaScript version of the [Microsoft Bot Framework SDK](https://github.com/Microsoft/botframework-sdk), which is part of the Microsoft Bot Framework - a comprehensive framework for building enterprise-grade conversational AI experiences.

This SDK enables developers to model conversation and build sophisticated bot applications using JavaScript. SDKs for [.NET](https://github.com/Microsoft/botbuilder-dotnet), [Python](https://github.com/Microsoft/botbuilder-python) and [Java (preview)](https://github.com/Microsoft/botbuilder-java) are also available.

To get started building bots using the SDK, see the [Azure Bot Service Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/?view=azure-bot-service-4.0).  If you are an existing user, then you can also [find out what's new with Bot Framework](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/what-is-new?view=azure-bot-service-4.0).

To view package interdependencies, see the [dependency graph](https://botbuildersdkblobstorag2.blob.core.windows.net/sdk-js-dependency-reports/latest/InterdependencyGraph.html).

## Getting Started

To get started building bots using the SDK, see the [Azure Bot Service Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/?view=azure-bot-service-4.0).

The [Bot Framework Samples](https://github.com/microsoft/botbuilder-samples) includes a rich set of samples repository.

If you want to debug an issue, would like to [contribute](#Contributing-and-our-code-of-conduct), or understand how the Bot Builder SDK works, instructions for building and testing the SDK are below.

### Prerequisites
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Yarn 1.x](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/)
- Your favorite code-editor for example [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

### Clone

Clone a copy of the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/botbuilder-js.git
```

Change to the SDK's directory:

```bash
cd botbuilder-js
```

### Build and test locally

Install the prerequisites.

```bash
yarn
```

Then use the following command to build the SDK.

```bash
yarn build
```

### Running unit tests

Use the following command to run the unit tests.

```bash
yarn test
```

The `prep-test.cmd` command is run to install test keys and start the [Azure Storage Emulator](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-use-emulator) if its installed. Any unit tests needing test keys or the storage emulator are designed to be skipped if their dependencies are missing so most developers won't need to worry about running this command.

If you have a need to re-generate the LUIS or connector clients using the latest swagger you'll need to install `autorest` (requires Node 7.10.0 or higher), which you can do with the following command.

```bash
yarn global add global autorest
```

[![Docker Pulls](https://img.shields.io/docker/pulls/metalmatze/alertmanager-bot.svg?maxAge=604800)](https://hub.docker.com/r/metalmatze/alertmanager-bot)
[![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/metalmatze/alertmanager-bot)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/metalmatze/alertmanager-bot)


This is the [Alertmanager](https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/alertmanager/) bot for
[Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) that notifies you on alerts.  
Just configure the Alertmanager to send Webhooks to the bot and that's it.

Additionally you can always **send commands** to get up-to-date information from the alertmanager.

### Why?

Alertmanager already integrates a lot of different messengers as receivers for alerts.  
I want to extend this basic functionality.

Previously the Alertmanager could only talk to you via a chat, but now you can talk back via [commands](#commands).  
You can ask about current ongoing [alerts](#alerts) and [silences](#silences).  
In the future I plan to also support silencing via the chat, so you can silences after getting an alert from within the chat.  
A lot of other things can be added!

## Messengers

Right now it supports [Telegram](https://telegram.org/), but I'd like to [add more](#more-messengers) in the future.

## Commands

###### /start

> Hey, Matthias! I will now keep you up to date!

#### Authentication

Additional users may be allowed to command the bot by giving multiple instances
of the `--telegram.admin` command line option or by specifying a
newline-separated list of telegram user IDs in the `TELEGRAM_ADMIN` environment
variable.
```
- TELEGRAM_ADMIN=""**********\n************""
--telegram.admin=1 --telegram.admin=2
```
#### Alertmanager Configuration

Now you need to connect the Alertmanager to send alerts to the bot.  
A webhook is used for that, so make sure your `LISTEN_ADDR` is reachable for the Alertmanager.

For example add this to your `alertmanager.yml` configuration:
```yaml
receivers:
- name: 'alertmanager-bot'
  webhook_configs:
  - send_resolved: true
    url: 'http://alertmanager-bot:8080'
```

## Development

Build the binary using `make`:

```
make
```

In case you have `$GOPATH/bin` in your `$PATH` you can now simply start the bot by running:

```bash
alertmanager-bot
```

## Missing

##### Commands

* `/silence` - show a specific silence  
* `/silence_del` - delete a silence by command  
* `/silence_add` - add a silence for a alert by command

##### More Messengers

At the moment I only implemented Telegram, because it's so freakin' easy to do.

Messengers considered to add in the future:

* [Slack](https://slack.com/)
* [Mattermost](https://about.mattermost.com/)
* [Matrix](https://matrix.org/)

If one is missing for you just open an issue.

219,219,confluentinc/bottledwater-pg,C,"NOTE: Bottled Water is unmaintained
===================================

**Please note that Bottled Water is no longer being actively developed.**

Bottled Water pioneered change data capture from PostgreSQL into Kafka using the logical decoding
API, but now other projects have adopted the technique and are continuing to develop it. Please see
the following resources for supported solutions for CDC from PostgreSQL into Kafka:

* The [Kafka Connector list](https://www.confluent.io/product/connectors/) provides an overview
  of projects that integrate databases with the
  [Kafka Connect framework](http://docs.confluent.io/current/connect/index.html).
* [Debezium](http://debezium.io/) integrates PostgreSQL with Kafka in a way that is similar to
  Bottled Water.

The remaining README is kept here for historical interest.


Bottled Water for PostgreSQL
============================

How do you export water from your country? Well, you first go to your reservoir, pump out all the
water, and fill it into bottles. You then go to the streams of clear mountain water flowing into
the reservoir, and tap into them, filling the fresh water into bottles as it arrives. Then you
ship those bottles all around the world.

How do you export data from your database? Well, you first take a consistent snapshot of your
entire database, and encode it in a language-independent format. You then look at the stream of
transactions writing to your database, and parse the transaction log, encoding the
inserts/updates/deletes into the same language-independent format as they happen. Then you take
that data and ship it to your other systems: build search indexes, update caches, load it into
a data warehouse, calculate analytics, monitor it for fraud, and so on.

* [Blog post explaining the background](http://blog.confluent.io/2015/04/23/bottled-water-real-time-integration-of-postgresql-and-kafka/)
* [Watch a short demo!](http://showterm.io/fde6260d684ee3a6ee692)


How it works
------------

Bottled Water uses the [logical decoding](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.5/static/logicaldecoding.html)
feature (introduced in PostgreSQL 9.4) to extract a consistent snapshot and a continuous stream
of change events from a database. The data is extracted at a row level, and encoded using
[Avro](http://avro.apache.org/). A client program connects to your database, extracts this data,
and relays it to [Kafka](http://kafka.apache.org/) (you could also integrate it with other systems
if you wish, but Kafka is pretty awesome).

Key features of Bottled Water are:

* Works with any PostgreSQL database (version 9.4 or later). There are no restrictions on your
  database schema.
* No schema changes are required, no triggers or additional tables. (However, you do need to be
  able to install a PostgreSQL extension on the database server. More on this below.)
* Negligible impact on database performance.
* Transactionally consistent output. That means: writes appear only when they are committed to the
  database (writes by aborted transactions are discarded), writes appear in the same order as they
  were committed (no race conditions).
* Fault-tolerant: does not lose data, even if processes crash, machines die, the network is
  interrupted, etc.


Quickstart
----------

There are several possible ways of installing and trying Bottled Water:

* [Running in Docker](#running-in-docker) is the fastest way of getting started, but currently
  only recommended for development environments.
* [Building from source](#building-from-source) is the most flexible, but also a bit fiddly.
* There are also [Ubuntu packages](https://launchpad.net/~stub/+archive/ubuntu/bottledwater),
  built by Stuart Bishop (Canonical).


Running in Docker
-----------------

The easiest way to try Bottled Water is to use the [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) images we have
prepared. You need at least 2GB of memory to run this demo, so if you're running inside a virtual
machine (such as [Boot2docker](http://boot2docker.io/) on a Mac), please check that it is big
enough.

First, install:

* [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/installation/), which is used to run the
  individual services/containers, and
* [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/), which is used to
  orchestrate the interaction between services.

After the prerequisite applications are installed, you need to build the Docker containers for Bottled Water and Postgres:

    $ make docker-compose

Once the build process finishes, set up some required environment variables,
then start up Postgres, Kafka and the [Confluent schema
registry](http://confluent.io/docs/current/schema-registry/docs/intro.html) by
running `docker-compose` as follows:

    $ export KAFKA_ADVERTISED_HOST_NAME=$(docker run --rm debian:jessie ip route | awk '/^default via / { print $3 }') \
             KAFKA_LOG_CLEANUP_POLICY=compact \
             KAFKA_AUTO_CREATE_TOPICS_ENABLE=true
    $ docker-compose up -d kafka schema-registry postgres

The `postgres-bw` image extends the
[official Postgres docker image](https://registry.hub.docker.com/_/postgres/) and adds
Bottled Water support. However, before Bottled Water can be used, it first needs to be
enabled. To do this, start a `psql` shell for the Postgres database:

    $ docker-compose run --rm psql

When the prompt appears, enable the `bottledwater` extension, and create a database with
some test data, for example:

    create extension bottledwater;
    create table test (id serial primary key, value text);
    insert into test (value) values('hello world!');

You can keep the psql terminal open, and run the following in a new terminal.

The next step is to start the Bottled Water client, which relays data from Postgres to Kafka.
You start it like this:

    $ docker-compose up -d bottledwater-avro

You can run `docker-compose logs bottledwater-avro` to see what it's doing. Now Bottled
Water has taken the snapshot, and continues to watch Postgres for any data changes. You can
see the data that has been extracted from Postgres by consuming from Kafka (the topic name
`test` must match up with the name of the table you created earlier):

    $ docker-compose run --rm kafka-avro-console-consumer \
        --from-beginning --property print.key=true --topic test

This should print out the contents of the `test` table in JSON format (key/value separated
by tab). Now go back to the `psql` terminal, and change some data — insert, update or delete
some rows in the `test` table. You should see the changes swiftly appear in the Kafka
consumer terminal.

When you're done testing, you can destroy the cluster and it's associated data volumes with:

    $ docker-compose stop
    $ docker-compose rm -vf

Building from source
--------------------

To compile Bottled Water is just a matter of:

    make && make install

For that to work, you need the following dependencies installed:

* [PostgreSQL 9.5](http://www.postgresql.org/) development libraries (PGXS and libpq).
  (Homebrew: `brew install postgresql`;
  Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install postgresql-server-dev-9.5 libpq-dev`)
* [libsnappy](https://code.google.com/p/snappy/), a dependency of Avro.
  (Homebrew: `brew install snappy`; Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install libsnappy-dev`)
* [avro-c](http://avro.apache.org/) (1.8.0 or later), the C implementation of Avro.
  (Homebrew: `brew install avro-c`; others: build from source)
* [Jansson](http://www.digip.org/jansson/), a JSON parser.
  (Homebrew: `brew install jansson`; Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install libjansson-dev`)
* [libcurl](http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/), a HTTP client.
  (Homebrew: `brew install curl`; Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install libcurl4-openssl-dev`)
* [librdkafka](https://github.com/edenhill/librdkafka) (0.9.1 or later), a Kafka client.
  (Ubuntu universe: `sudo apt-get install librdkafka-dev`, but see [known gotchas](#known-gotchas-with-older-dependencies); others: build from source)

You can see the Dockerfile for
[building the quickstart images](https://github.com/ept/bottledwater-pg/blob/master/build/Dockerfile.build)
as an example of building Bottled Water and its dependencies on Debian.

If you get errors about *Package libsnappy was not found in the pkg-config search path*,
and you have Snappy installed, you may need to create `/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig/libsnappy.pc`
with contents something like the following (be sure to check which version of _libsnappy_
is installed in your system):

    Name: libsnappy
    Description: Snappy is a compression library
    Version: 1.1.2
    URL: https://google.github.io/snappy/
    Libs: -L/usr/local/lib -lsnappy
    Cflags: -I/usr/local/include


Configuration
-------------

The `make install` command above installs an extension into the Postgres installation on
your machine, which does all the work of encoding change data into Avro. There's then a
separate client program which connects to Postgres, fetches the data, and pushes it to Kafka.

To configure Bottled Water, you need to set the following in `postgresql.conf`: (If you're
using Homebrew, you can probably find it in `/usr/local/var/postgres`. On Linux, it's
probably in `/etc/postgres`.)

    wal_level = logical
    max_wal_senders = 8
    wal_keep_segments = 4
    max_replication_slots = 4

You'll also need to give yourself the replication privileges for the database. You can do
this by adding the following to `pg_hba.conf` (in the same directory, replacing `<user>`
with your login username):

    local   replication     <user>                 trust
    host    replication     <user>  127.0.0.1/32   trust
    host    replication     <user>  ::1/128        trust

Restart Postgres for the changes to take effect. Next, enable the Postgres extension that
`make install` installed previously. Start `psql -h localhost` and run:

    create extension bottledwater;

That should be all the setup on the Postgres side. Next, make sure you're running Kafka
and the [Confluent schema registry](http://confluent.io/docs/current/schema-registry/docs/index.html),
for example by following the [quickstart](http://confluent.io/docs/current/quickstart.html).

Assuming that everything is running on the default ports on localhost, you can start
Bottled Water as follows:

    ./kafka/bottledwater --postgres=postgres://localhost

The first time this runs, it will create a replication slot called `bottledwater`,
take a consistent snapshot of your database, and send it to Kafka. (You can change the
name of the replication slot with the `--slot` [command line
flag](#command-line-options).) When the snapshot is complete, it switches to consuming
the replication stream.

If the slot already exists, the tool assumes that no snapshot is needed, and simply
resumes the replication stream where it last left off.

In some scenarios, if you only care about streaming ongoing changes (and not
replicating the existing database contents into Kafka), you may want to skip the
snapshot - e.g. to avoid the performance overhead of taking the snapshot, or because
you are repointing Bottled Water at a newly promoted replica.  In that case, you can
pass `--skip-snapshot` at the [command line](#command-line-options).  (This option is
ignored if the replication slot already exists.)

When you no longer want to run Bottled Water, you have to drop its replication slot
(otherwise you'll eventually run out of disk space, as the open replication slot
prevents the WAL from getting garbage-collected). You can do this by opening `psql`
again and running:

    select pg_drop_replication_slot('bottledwater');


### Error handling

If Bottled Water encounters an error - such as failure to communicate with Kafka or
the Schema Registry - its default behaviour is for the client to exit, halting the
flow of data into Kafka.  This may seem like an odd default, but since Postgres will
retain and replay the logical replication stream until Bottled Water acknowledges it,
it ensures that:

 * it will never miss an update (every update made in Postgres will eventually be
   written to Kafka) - _provided_ that whatever caused the error is resolved
   externally (e.g.  restoring connectivity to Kafka) and the Bottled Water client is
   then restarted;

 * it will never write corrupted data to Kafka: e.g. if unable to obtain a schema id
   from the Schema Registry for the current update, rather than writing to Kafka
   without a schema id (which would leave consumers unable to parse the update), it
   will wait until the problem is resolved.

However, in some scenarios, exiting on the first error may not be desirable:

 * if there is an error publishing for one table (e.g. if Kafka is configured not to
   autocreate topics and the corresponding topic has not been explicitly created), you
   may not want to halt updates for all other tables.

 * if the reason for the error cannot be resolved quickly (e.g. Kafka misconfiguration
   or prolonged outage), Bottled Water may threaten the stability of the Postgres
   server.  This is because Postgres will store WAL on disk for all updates made since
   Bottled Water last acknowledged (i.e. successfully published) an update.  If
   Postgres has a high write throughput, Bottled Water being unavailable may cause the
   disk on the Postgres server to fill up, likely causing Postgres to crash.

To support these scenarios, Bottled Water supports an alternative error handling
policy where it will simply log that the error occurred and drop the update it was
attempting to process, acknowledging the update so that Postgres can stop retaining
WAL.  This policy can be enabled via the `--on-error` [command-line
switch](#command-line-options).  N.B. that in this mode Bottled Water can no longer
guarantee to never miss an update.


Consuming data
--------------

Bottled Water creates one Kafka topic per database table, with the same name as the
table. The messages in the topic use the table's primary key (or replica identity
index, if set) as key, and the entire table row as value. With inserts and updates,
the message value is the new contents of the row. With deletes, the message value
is null, which allows Kafka's [log compaction](http://kafka.apache.org/documentation.html#compaction)
to garbage-collect deleted values.

If a table doesn't have a primary key or replica identity index, Bottled Water will
complain and refuse to start. You can override this with the `--allow-unkeyed`
[option](#command-line-options).  Any inserts and updates to tables without primary
key or replica identity will be sent to Kafka as messages without a key. Deletes to
such tables are not sent to Kafka.

Messages are written to Kafka by default in a binary Avro encoding, which is
efficient, but not human-readable. To view the contents of a Kafka topic, you can use
the Avro console consumer:

    ./bin/kafka-avro-console-consumer --topic test --zookeeper localhost:2181 \
        --property print.key=true


### Output formats

Bottled Water currently supports writing messages to Kafka in one of two output
formats: Avro, or JSON.  The output format is configured via the `--output-format`
[command-line switch](#command-line-options).

Avro is recommended for large scale use, since it uses a much more efficient binary
encoding for messages, defines rules for [schema
evolution](http://docs.confluent.io/1.0/avro.html), and is able to faithfully
represent a wide range of column types.  Avro output requires an instance of the
[Confluent Schema
Registry](http://docs.confluent.io/1.0/schema-registry/docs/intro.html) to be running,
and consumers will need to query the schema registry in order to decode messages.

JSON is ideal for evaluation and prototyping, or integration with languages
without good Avro library support.  JSON is human readable, and widely supported among
programming languages.  JSON output does not require a schema registry.


### Topic names

For each table being streamed, Bottled Water publishes messages to a corresponding
Kafka topic.  The naming convention for topics is
*\[topic_prefix\].\[postgres_schema_name\].table_name*:

 * *table_name* is the name of the table in Postgres.
 * *postgres_schema_name* is the name of the Postgres
   [schema](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/sql-createschema.html) the
   table belongs to; this is omitted if the schema is ""public"" (the default schema
   under the default Postgres configuration).  N.B. this requires the avro-c library
   to be [at least version 0.8.0](#avro-c--080-schema-omitted-from-topic-name).
 * *topic_prefix* is omitted by default, but may be configured via the
   `--topic-prefix` [command-line option](#command-line-options).  A prefix is useful:
       * to prevent name collisions with other topics, if the Kafka broker is also
         being used for other purposes besides Bottled Water.
       * if you want to stream several databases into the same broker, using a
         separate Bottled Water instance with a different prefix for each database.
       * to make it easier for a Kafka consumer to consume updates from all Postgres
         tables, by using a topic regex that matches the prefix.

For example:

 * with no prefix configured, a table named ""users"" in the public (default) schema
   would be streamed to a topic named ""users"".
 * with `--topic-prefix=bottledwater`, a table named ""transactions"" in the
   ""point-of-sale"" schema would be streamed to a topic named
   ""bottledwater.point-of-sale.transactions"".

(Support for [namespaces in
Kafka](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-37+-+Add+Namespaces+to+Kafka)
has been proposed that would replace this sort of ad-hoc prefixing, but it's still
under discussion.)


Known gotchas with older dependencies
-------------------------------------

It is recommended to compile Bottled Water against the versions of librdkafka and
avro-c specified [above](#building-from-source).  However, Bottled Water may work with
older versions, with degraded functionality.

At time of writing, the librdkafka-dev packages in the official Ubuntu repositories
(for all releases up to 15.10) contain a release prior to 0.8.6.  This means if you
are building on Ubuntu, building librdkafka from source is recommended, until an
updated librdkafka package is available.

### librdkafka &lt; 0.8.6: empty messages sent for deletes

As noted [above](#consuming-data), Bottled Water sends a null message to represent a
row deletion.  librdkafka only added [support for null
messages](https://github.com/edenhill/librdkafka/pull/200) in [release 0.8.6](https://github.com/edenhill/librdkafka/releases/tag/0.8.6).  If Bottled Water
is compiled against a version of librdkafka prior to 0.8.6, deletes will instead be
represented by *empty* messages, i.e. a message whose payload is an empty byte
sequence.  This means that Kafka will not garbage-collect deleted values on log
compaction, and also may confuse consumers that expect all non-null message payloads
to begin with a header.

### librdkafka &lt; 0.9.0: messages partitioned randomly

librdkafka 0.9.0+ provides a ""consistent partitioner"", which assigns messages to
partitions based on the hash of the key.  Bottled Water takes advantage of this
to ensure that all inserts, updates and deletes for a given key get sent to the
same partition.

If Bottled Water is compiled against a version of librdkafka prior to 0.9.0,
messages will instead be assigned randomly to partitions.  If the topic
corresponding to a given table has more than one partition, this will lead to
incorrect log compaction behaviour (e.g. if the initial insert for row 42 goes
to partition 0, then a subsequent delete for row 42 goes to partition 1, then
log compaction will be unable to garbage-collect the insert).  It will also
break any consumer relying on seeing all updates relating to a given key (e.g.
for a stream-table join).

### avro-c &lt; 0.8.0: schema omitted from topic name

Bottled Water encodes the Postgres schema to which tables belong in the Avro schema
namespace.  Support for accessing the schema namespace was added to the Avro C library
in version 0.8.0, so prior releases do not have access to this information.

If Bottled Water is compiled against a version of avro-c prior to 0.8.0, the schema
will be omitted from the [Kafka topic name](#topic-names).  This means that tables
with the same names in different schemas will have changes streamed to the same topic.


Command-line options
--------------------

This serves as a reference for the various command-line options accepted by the
Bottled Water client, annotated with links to the relevant areas of documentation.
If this disagrees with the output of `bottledwater --help`, then `--help` is correct
(and please file a pull request to update this reference!).


 * `-d`, `--postgres=postgres://user:pass@host:port/dbname` **(required)**:
   Connection string or URI of the PostgreSQL server.

 * `-s`, `--slot=slotname` *(default: bottledwater)*:
   Name of [replication slot](#configuration).  The slot is automatically created on
   first use.

 * `-b`, `--broker=host1[:port1],host2[:port2]...` *(default: localhost:9092)*:
   Comma-separated list of Kafka broker hosts/ports.

 * `-r`, `--schema-registry=http://hostname:port` *(default: http://localhost:8081)*:
   URL of the service where Avro schemas are registered.  (Used only for
   `--output-format=avro`.  Omit when `--output-format=json`.)

 * `-f`, `--output-format=[avro|json]` *(default: avro)*:
   How to encode the messages for writing to Kafka.  See discussion of [output
   formats](#output-formats).

 * `-u`, `--allow-unkeyed`:
   Allow export of tables that don't have a primary key.  This is [disallowed by
   default](#consuming-data), because updates and deletes need a primary key to
   identify their row.

 * `-p`, `--topic-prefix=prefix`:
   String to prepend to all [topic names](#topic-names).  e.g. with
   `--topic-prefix=postgres`, updates from table ""users"" will be written to topic
   ""postgres.users"".

 * `-e`, `--on-error=[log|exit]` *(default: exit)*:
   What to do in case of a transient error, such as failure to publish to Kafka.  See
   discussion of [error handling](#error-handling).

 * `-x`, `--skip-snapshot`:
   Skip taking a [consistent snapshot](#configuration) of the existing database
   contents and just start streaming any new updates.  (Ignored if the replication
   slot already exists.)

 * `-C`, `--kafka-config property=value`:
   Set global configuration property for Kafka producer (see [librdkafka
   docs](https://github.com/edenhill/librdkafka/blob/master/CONFIGURATION.md)).

 * `-T`, `--topic-config property=value`:
   Set topic configuration property for Kafka producer (see [librdkafka
   docs](https://github.com/edenhill/librdkafka/blob/master/CONFIGURATION.md)).

 * `--config-help`:
   Print the list of Kafka configuration properties.

 * `-h`, `--help`: Print this help text.


Developing
----------

If you want to work on the Bottled Water codebase, the [Docker setup](#running-in-docker) is
a good place to start.

Bottled Water ships with a [test suite](spec) that [verifies basic
functionality](spec/functional/message_spec.rb), [documents supported Postgres
types](spec/functional/type_specs.rb) and [tests message publishing
semantics](spec/functional/partitioning_spec.rb).  The test suite also relies on Docker and
Docker Compose.  To run it:

 1. Install Docker and Docker Compose (see [Docker setup](#running-in-docker))
 2. Install Ruby 2.2.4 (see [ruby-lang.org](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/))
    (required to run the tests)
 3. Install Bundler: `gem install bundler`
 4. Build the Docker images: `make docker-compose`
 5. Run the tests: `make test`

If submitting a pull request, particularly one that adds new functionality, it is highly
encouraged to include tests that exercise the changed code!


Status
------

Bottled Water has been tested on a variety of use cases and Postgres schemas, and is
believed to be fairly stable.  In particular, because of its design, it is unlikely to
corrupt the data in Postgres. However, it has not yet been run on large production
databases, or for long periods of time, so proceed with caution if you intend to use
it in production.  See [this discussion about production
readiness](https://github.com/confluentinc/bottledwater-pg/issues/96), and [Github
issues](https://github.com/confluentinc/bottledwater-pg/issues) for a list of known
issues.

Bug reports and pull requests welcome.

Note that Bottled Water has nothing to do with
[Sparkling Water](https://github.com/h2oai/sparkling-water), a machine learning
engine for Spark.

## Status of this repo
This repo is no longer maintained and is not ready to work Discord's new intent system. FredBoat is still being actively developed in private by me as part of [BotLabs](https://botlabs.gg/).

In the end, FredBoat was never very good for selfhosting, and this has shown with the decrease in engagement in this repo. At some point in the future, I might create a self-contained stripped-down version of FredBoat intended for this purpose. Please email me if you'd be interested in using or collaborating on such a project.

Thanks to all contributors over the years! I am still grateful for all the help I've received.

224,224,cinchrb/cinch,Ruby,"Cinch - The IRC Bot Building Framework
=====================================

**The Cinch project is no longer maintained. No new features will be
added, and no bugs will be fixed. The repository has been archived. If
you wish to continue developing Cinch, please fork the project. I am
not accepting new maintainers for this project.**

Description
-----------

Cinch is an IRC Bot Building Framework for quickly creating IRC bots in
Ruby with minimal effort. It provides a simple interface based on plugins and
rules. It's as easy as creating a plugin, defining a rule, and watching your
profits flourish.

Cinch will do all of the hard work for you, so you can spend time creating cool
plugins and extensions to wow your internet peers.

For general support, join #cinch channel on Freenode server (irc://irc.freenode.org/cinch) – but
please don't bring any bots.

Installation
------------

### RubyGems

You can install the latest Cinch gem using RubyGems

```
gem install cinch
```

### GitHub

Alternatively you can check out the latest code directly from Github

```
git clone http://github.com/cinchrb/cinch.git
```

Example
-------

Your typical Hello, World application in Cinch would go something like this:

```ruby
require 'cinch'

bot = Cinch::Bot.new do
  configure do |c|
    c.server = ""irc.freenode.org""
    c.channels = [""#cinch-bots""]
  end

  on :message, ""hello"" do |m|
    m.reply ""Hello, #{m.user.nick}""
  end
end

bot.start
```

More examples can be found in the `examples` directory.

Features
--------

### Documentation

Cinch provides a documented API, which is online for your viewing pleasure
[here](http://rubydoc.info/gems/cinch/frames).

### Object Oriented

Many IRC bots (and there are, **so** many) are great, but we see so little of
them take advantage of the awesome Object Oriented Interface which most Ruby
programmers will have become accustomed to and grown to love.

Well, Cinch uses this functionality to its advantage. Rather than having to
pass around a reference to a channel or a user, to another method, which then
passes it to another method (by which time you're confused about what's
going on) -- Cinch provides an OOP interface for even the simpliest of tasks,
making your code simple and easy to comprehend.

### Threaded

Unlike a lot of popular IRC frameworks, Cinch is threaded. But wait, don't let
that scare you. It's totally easy to grasp.

Each of Cinch's plugins and handlers are executed in their own personal thread.
This means the main thread can stay focused on what it does best, providing
non-blocking reading and writing to an IRC server. This will prevent your bot
from locking up when one of your plugins starts doing some intense operations.
Damn that's handy.

### Plugins

That's right folks, Cinch provides a modular based plugin system. This is a
feature many people have bugged us about for a long time. It's finally here,
and it's as awesome as you had hoped!

This system allows you to create feature packed plugins without interfering with
any of the Cinch internals. Everything in your plugin is self contained, meaning
you can share your favorite plugins among your friends and release a ton of
your own plugins for others to use

Want to see the same Hello, World application in plugin form? Sure you do!

```ruby
require 'cinch'

class Hello
  include Cinch::Plugin

  match ""hello""

  def execute(m)
    m.reply ""Hello, #{m.user.nick}""
  end
end

bot = Cinch::Bot.new do
  configure do |c|
    c.server = ""irc.freenode.org""
    c.channels = [""#cinch-bots""]
    c.plugins.plugins = [Hello]
  end
end

bot.start
```

Note: Plugins take a default prefix of `/^!/` which means the actual match is `!hello`.

More information can be found in the {Cinch::Plugin} documentation.

### Numeric Replies

Do you know what IRC code 401 represents? How about 376? or perhaps 502?
Sure you don't (and if you do, you're as geeky as us!). Cinch doesn't expect you
to store the entire IRC RFC code set in your head, and rightfully so!

That's exactly why Cinch has a ton of constants representing these numbers
so you don't have to remember them. We're so nice.

### Pretty Output

Ever get fed up of watching those boring, frankly unreadable lines
flicker down your terminal screen whilst your bot is online? Help is
at hand! By default, Cinch will colorize all text it sends to a
terminal, meaning you get some pretty damn awesome readable coloured
text. Cinch also provides a way for your plugins to log custom
messages:

```ruby
on :message, /hello/ do |m|
  debug ""Someone said hello""
end
```

Contribute
----------

Love Cinch? Love Ruby? Love helping? Of course you do! If you feel like Cinch
is missing that awesome jaw-dropping feature and you want to be the one to
make this magic happen, you can!

Please note that although we very much appreciate all of your efforts, Cinch
will not accept patches in aid of Ruby 1.8 compatibility. We have no intention
of supporting Ruby versions below 1.9.1.

Fork the project, implement your awesome feature in its own branch, and send
a pull request to one of the Cinch collaborators. We'll be more than happy
to check it out.

  <summary>Click to expand</summary>

   1. Check `🎶 Music Requirements` that you started lavalink / use a valid public lavalink station
   2. Fill in all required data in `./botconfig/config.json` **NOTE:** *If you're on replit.com, it is exposed to everyone!(use .env instead)*
   3. Fill in all required data in the `.json` Files in `./social_log/` (`./social_log/streamconfig.json` & `./social_log/twitter.json`), if you want the SOCIAL LOGS to work! (the key `authToken` in streamconfig is not needed to be filled in!)
   4. You can adjust some settings in the other `./botconfig/*.json` Files, **BUT PLEASE __KEEP__ MY CREDITS & ADS!** This is the only way on how my hard work is ""revenued""
   5. Now start the bot by typing opening a cmd in that folder and type: `node index.js` or `npm start`
     * If you don't want to keep the terminal open or if you're on linux, check out [pm2 (and my tutorial)](https://github.com/Tomato6966/Debian-Cheat-Sheet-Setup/wiki/4-pm2-tutorial) and type: `pm2 start --name Bot_Name index.js`

### *The project where anything goes, as long as the code allows it.*

A bot will automatically merge any PR on this repo that gets enough votes from the community. PRs can contain anything, *even changes to the bot's voting code*.

## Getting Started

* View the [open Pull Requests](https://github.com/botwillacceptanything/botwillacceptanything/pulls) to see what changes have been proposed
* :star: **Star the repo**, or else your votes won't get counted
* On a pull request thread, add your vote along with a short explanation and/or feedback to the author. The string `:+1:` (:+1:) anywhere within the comment makes the comment count as a vote *for* the PR to pass; conversely, the string `:-1:` (:-1:) anywhere within the comment makes the comment count as a vote *against* the PR.

## Contributing

Anyone can create a pull request, and it is greatly appreciated by the community. In order for a pull request to be accepted, the bot has requested that it meets the criteria in its [Definition of Done](https://github.com/botwillacceptanything/botwillacceptanything/blob/master/DoD.md). If you're looking for ideas, please look at [ideas.md](https://github.com/botwillacceptanything/botwillacceptanything/blob/master/ideas.md), and join us in our [IRC](http://kiwiirc.com/client/irc.freenode.net/anythingbot) for ideas or advice on how to implement something.

## Community

[![Visit our IRC channel](https://kiwiirc.com/buttons/irc.freenode.net/anythingbot.png)](https://kiwiirc.com/client/irc.freenode.net/#anythingbot)

The bot is [**@anythingbot** on Twitter.](https://twitter.com/anythingbot/)

## Running Servers

The bot runs on a 1GB DigitalOcean VPS in SF at [botwillacceptanything.com](http://botwillacceptanything.com) without root access. Port 80 is a proxy to port 3000 via nginx.

## Bot Webserver Paths

The bot has a built-in webserver for monitoring its current state.

## Running the bot locally to test changes

1. Fork this repo.
1. Get yourself an OAuth token for github at https://github.com/settings/tokens/new. (TODO what scopes are required?)
1. Copy configs/template.js -> configs/custom.js and modify accordingly.
1. Disable any items in the mocks section that you would like to function normally.

```javascript
$ cp configs/template.js configs/custom.js
$ vim configs/custom.js
$ cat configs/custom.js
(function () {
    'use strict';

    module.exports = {
        webserver: {
            port: 3000
        },
        user: ""YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME"",
        repo: ""botwillacceptanything"",
        githubAuth: {
            type: ""oauth"",
            token: ""YOUR_OAUTH_TOKEN""
        },
        mocks: {
            twitter: true,
        },
    };
}());

```
1. (Optional) Set up GitHub Webhooks by following the next section.
1. (Optional) Install node-foreman with npm. The package prefers a 
global install but a non-global one will work if the 'nf' command can be 
found in the PATH.
1. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
1. Run `node main.js` to start the bot. Alternatively, if you installed 
foreman earlier, `nf start` will also 
start the bot as well as giving slightly prettier console output.

## Setting up GitHub Webhooks

1. Go to your repository settings, and click **Webhooks & Services**
1. Create a new webhook with the following settings:
  * Payload URL: Externally accessible address with a path of /webhook/github
    * http://example.com:3000/webhook/github
  * Content type: *application/json*
  * Secret: **Copy this secret. It is used in the config.**
  * Which events: *Send me **everything**.*
1. Add the Webhook Secret into config.js like this:
```javascript
exports.githubAuth.webhookSecret = 'rsvz9ytsjMpYfKW8CO8SQPSoxiJsVb03';
```

## FAQ

### <a name='q1'> 1. Issue with installing packages</a>
If you couldnt install binary bot with a different node version, try cleaning npm cache.
 - To clear a cache in npm, we need to run the ```npm cache clean --force``` command in our terminal.
 - Delete cache directory. The default cache directory is ~/.npm on Posix (mac or linux), or %AppData%/npm-cache on Windows.
 - Run ```rm -rf ~/.npm``` 
 - Run ```npm install```

### <a name='q2'> 2. Getting Permission Denied Error on localhost</a>
Try ```sudo npm start```instead of ```npm start```

### <a name='q3'>3. Cannot access the site</a>
 Make sure to use HTTP instead of HTTPS: https://localbot.binary.sx/bot.html  => http://localbot.binary.sx/bot.html

Make bots in Java.

__JBot__ is a java framework _(inspired by [Howdyai's Botkit](https://github.com/howdyai/botkit))_ to
make Slack and Facebook bots in minutes. It provides all the boilerplate code needed so that you
can make your bot live right away.

## Why use JBot?

* Provides you with __all the boilerplate code__ which handles underlying websocket connections and other complexities.
* Supports __extra events__ in addition to all the events supported by Slack/Facebook which makes your work a lot more easier.
* __Receiving & sending messages__ is as easy as defining a `@Controller` and calling `reply()`.
* __Conversation feature__ of JBot makes talking to your bot a breeze. This feature makes JBot different than rest of the Java frameworks out there.
* __Well tested__ with good coverage unit tests.
* And many other features which can't just be mentioned here.

**Not satisfied?** Read on...

* JBot got more than __400 stars__ in just 2 days after release.
* It is in the [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12239667) 50 club.
* Chosen by [DZone daily picks](http://mailer.dzone.com/display.php?M=15184241&C=dcebb6887365120539df1fbf19a071ed&S=9043&L=658&N=4604).
* Last but not the least, it's listed on [Slack.com](https://api.slack.com/community)

**Still worried?** Open an [issue on Github](https://github.com/rampatra/jbot/issues) and we can discuss.

## JBot for Slack

**Running your SlackBot is just 4 easy steps:**
  
1. Clone this project `$ git clone https://github.com/rampatra/jbot.git`.  
2. [Create a slack bot](https://my.slack.com/services/new/bot) and get your slack token.  
3. Paste the token in [application.properties](/jbot-example/src/main/resources/application.properties) file.  
4. Run the example application by running `JBotApplication` in your IDE or via commandline: 
    ```bash
    $ cd jbot
    $ mvn clean install
    $ cd jbot-example
    $ mvn spring-boot:run
    ```

You can now start talking with your bot ;)

Read the detailed [Slack documentation](https://blog.rampatra.com/how-to-make-a-slack-bot-in-java) to learn more.

## JBot for Facebook

**Similar to Slack, Facebook is simple too but has few extra steps:**

1. Clone this project `$ git clone git@github.com:rampatra/jbot.git`.
2. Create a [facebook app](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/apps/register#create-app) and a 
[page](https://www.facebook.com/pages/create).
3. Generate a Page Access Token for the page (inside app's messenger settings).
4. Paste the token created above in [application.properties](/jbot-example/src/main/resources/application.properties) file.
5. Run the example application by running `JBotApplication` in your IDE or via commandline: 
    ```bash
    $ cd jbot
    $ mvn clean install
    $ cd jbot-example
    $ mvn spring-boot:run
    ```
6. Setup webhook to receive messages and other events. You need to have a public address to setup webhook. You may use
[localtunnel.me](https://localtunnel.me) to generate a public address if you're running locally on your machine.
7. Specify the address created above in ""Callback Url"" field under ""Webooks"" setting and give the verify token 
as `fb_token_for_jbot` and click ""Verify and Save"".

You can now start messaging your bot by going to the facebook page and clicking on the ""Send message"" button. 

_If you're too lazy to start now and just want to play around, you can try `jbot-example` by visiting 
[JBot facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/jbotframework/) and clicking on the ""Send Message"" button._

230,230,CharlieHess/slack-poker-bot,JavaScript,"## Slack Poker Bot [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/CharlieHess/slack-poker-bot.png)](https://travis-ci.org/CharlieHess/slack-poker-bot)

A bot that turns Slack into a legitimate Texas Hold'em client. Start a game in any channel or private group with 2-10 players. PokerBot will deal hands, direct message players with their hole cards, query players for their action, determine the winning hand, and handle the pot.

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/f.cl.ly/items/3w3k222T0A1o2e0d033Q/Image%202015-09-01%20at%2011.41.33%20PM.png)
![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/f.cl.ly/items/2a073W0Q1Y2N0O2U1i3p/Image%202015-09-01%20at%2011.39.28%20PM.png)

See it [in action](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Joku-PKUObE).

## Getting Started
1. Create a new [bot integration](https://my.slack.com/services/new/bot)
1. Follow the steps to deploy the bot to Heroku or run it locally
1. Once the bot is running, start a game with: `@<your-bot-name>: deal`

#### One-Click Heroku
Click this button:

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.png)](https://heroku.com/deploy)

#### Manual Heroku
1. Install [Heroku toolbelt](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs#set-up)
1. Create a new bot integration (as above)
1. `heroku create`
1. `heroku config:set SLACK_POKER_BOT_TOKEN=[Your API token]`
1. `git push heroku master`

#### To Run Locally
1. Create a `token.txt` file and paste your API token there
1. `npm install`
1. `node src/main.js`

## Directions
* To start a game, `@<your-bot-name>: deal`.
* To end a game, `@<your-bot-name>: quit game`. The game will end once the current hand finishes.
Note that any player can end a game at any time with this command, so Be Honorable™.
* To configure some bot options, `@<your-bot-name>: config <name-of-option>=<value>`. The supported options are:
```
timeout: Sets the duration (in seconds) before a player times out. 
Set to 0 to specify no timeout.
```
So, to start a game without any player timeout, say:
```
@<your-bot-name>: config timeout=0
@<your-bot-name>: deal
```

Check the open issues for some planned enhancements.

### AI Players
Although this client was built for managing human players in a Slack channel, it has some support for AI players. To add a bot player:

1. Add a bot class under the `ai/` folder
1. Implement `getAction`, which is called whenever it is the bot's turn
1. Modify the `addBotPlayers` method in `src/bot.js` to add your bot to every game

### Test All The Things
To run tests, simply do:

1. `gulp`

The tests produce legible output that matches what users in Slack would see. This is the same test suite that is run on each pull request. This is very helpful when diagnosing a logic bug:
![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/f.cl.ly/items/2L0Y2Y3d3g0i1x171n2V/Image%202015-09-08%20at%207.00.40%20PM.png)

### Dependencies
* [NodeJS Slack Client](https://github.com/slackhq/node-slack-client)
`node-slack-client` abstracts the basics of a Slack bot, including authentication, getting messages from players, and posting messages or attachments to the channel.

* [RxJS](https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS)
The majority of this client is written using `RxJS`. It simplifies many of the complex player polling interactions, that would otherwise be Death By Timers, into very legible code.

* [Imgur](https://github.com/kaimallea/node-imgur) / [Lightweight Image Processor](https://github.com/EyalAr/lwip)
Each card is a separate image, and board images are created on the fly by pasting several cards onto a single canvas (with the help of  `lwip`). The resulting image is than uploaded to `imgur`, which gives us a single URL that can be passed as an attachment to the Slack API. This route was chosen to avoid uploading 318,505,200 images to the cloud, and allows us to modify the card assets easily.

* [Poker Evaluator](https://github.com/chenosaurus/poker-evaluator)
`poker-evaluator` is used for evaluating the winning hand when it comes time to show down. Here it has been extended to calculate the best 5-card hand from any 7-card hand.

```
TESTED REPO WORKING FINE FOR ME ABUSE=BAN ON Her*ku...
```

A Telegram Torrent (and youtube-dl) Leecher based on [Pyrogram](https://github.com/pyrogram/pyrogram)

## installing

### The Easy Way

Do Not Abuse 🥺, Better Use Public Leech Groups

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy)


### The Eas(iest) Way

- Install Docker by following the [official docker docs](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/debian/)

- Start docker daemon [skip if already running]:
```sh
dockerd
```
- Build Docker image:
```sh
docker build . -t public-leech
```
- Run the image:
```sh
docker run public-leech
```

IF You want to Use this Bot Use in Closed Supergroup Avoid Giving Access to Untrusted Personal.


### The Legacy Way
Simply clone the repository and run the main file:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Omkar47/AutoLeecher.git
cd AutoLeecher
virtualenv -p /usr/bin/python3 venv
. ./venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
# <Create conf.py appropriately>
python3 -m apdbot
```

### an example for creating conf.py 👇
```py
from apdbot.sample_con import Config

class Config(Config):
  BOT_TOKEN = """"
  APP_ID = 6
  API_HASH = ""eb06d4abfb49dc3eeb1aeb98ae0f581e""
  AUTH = [-1001234567890, -1001234567891]
```

# Pokétwo 

:bangbang: | Pokétwo is currently undergoing a full rewrite—if you're looking to contribute, please be advised that I do not intend to make too many changes to the current version.
:---: | :---

A Pokémon-oriented Discord bot that lets you collect pokémon. Catch pokémon in the wild, level your pokémon, compete with your friends, and more.

The source code here is provided for educational purposes. I would recommend against running your own instance of this bot. Instead, use `p!invite` and [click the link](https://invite.poketwo.net) to add the bot to your server.

## Contributing

I'm open to contributions. Please, however, make an issue first if you want to contribute to the bot.

Right now, the code's still quite convoluted. I am working on refactoring and reorganizing the project.

## Roadmap

I'm looking to add the following major features to the bot, in addition to QoL fixes and small updates:

- Pokémon
	- The rest of the forms
	- Gender differences
	- More customizations options, like Pokéballs
- Battling
	- Different modes (1v1, 3v3, team battles, etc.)
	- TMs and HMs
	- Abilities
	- Fully implementing status moves
	- A way to train EVs
	- Cosmetics like custom backgrounds
- Other
	- Daily/weekly quests with rewards
	- Achievements/profile badges
	- Egg hatching/breeding
	- Generally more customization options

## FAQ
> Q: What protocols is jeeves running on?

A: Jeeves is running on WeChat web protocols.

> Q: How is jeeves different from other WeChat bots?

A: Jeeves is aimed to disguise itself as a normal web WeChat app. So we value **details**. Jeeves not only submits requests which are essential to login process, but also submits those are used for cross-platform status synchronization, status report and so on. The more details jeeves imitate, the safer your account is. Jeeves provides the following imitations.
* Jeeves starts login process with requesting the login page (default as https://wx.qq.com) while most other bots skip directly to getting uuid.
* Jeeves stores all the cookies carefully. It evens brings cookies in a request for getting images, which makes the request look like it's from a real browser. 
* During the login process, when the QR code is expired, jeeves will start over the whole login process to get a new QR code. But in the following requests, a `refreshTimes` cookie is inserted, which indicates how many times that jeeves has started over. This is the way a **real** web WeChat app works.
* Jeeves knows how to generate a random code/timestamp just as web WeChat do. We've studied some javascript code of web WeChat.
* A `statusNotify` request with `StatusNotifyCode.READED` is used to notify the mobile WeChat app that all the messages in a given conversation have been read. Jeeves takes care of it for you. When you send a plain text message to a contact, jeeves would check if there're any unread messages in the conversation between you and the contact. If true, jeeves will first send out `statusNotify` to mark all these message read prior to the message request, which makes sense in a real world case.

> Q: What can I do using jeeves?

A: Jeeves is a perfect tool if you'd like to store all the messages locally. As a mischief, you can send the messages that others have recalled back to chatroom. Use your imagination!

> Q: What can't jeeves do?

A: Jeeves is still in masterelopment. Some complicated features such as sending an image is still in the todo list. Find all the available events and apis in the [Usages](#usages).

> Q: Can jeeves prevent itself from disconnecting from server?

A: Jeeves can't guarantee it. We're still working on it. Usually jeeves can stay for hours, up to 2 days. To stay connected as long as possible, **DON'T** have any unusual behaviors that real humans don't have. For example, sending 100 messages in one second.

> Q: Why is my account blocked on web WeChat?

A: It depends on lots of factors. Tencent has statistics of all the behaviors and data of your account. Some unusual behaviors would put your account in risk. For example, sending messages to a person doesn't exist or you're not allowed to chat with. Additionally, Tencent has a list of the limits on all kinds of actions that an account can take. If your account exceeds the boundary, it could be blocked. For example, too many times of login in a short time.

## Known Issues
* Jeeves is using [ZXing](https://github.com/zxing/zxing) for printing QR in terminal. It's seldom that `com.google.zxing.NotFoundException` is thrown. We're still investigating into it. To workaround it, just restart jeeves.

## Warning
Using any WeChat bots, including jeeves, could cause your account be blocked. It's at your own risk.

[![Version](https://img.shields.io/travis/lionheart/bottlenose.svg?style=flat)](https://travis-ci.org/lionheart/bottlenose)
[![Version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/bottlenose.svg?style=flat)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/bottlenose)

Bottlenose is a thin, well-tested, maintained, and powerful Python wrapper over the Amazon Product Advertising API.  There is practically no overhead, and no magic (unless you add it yourself).

Before you get started, make sure you have both Amazon Product Advertising and AWS accounts. `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` and `AWS_ASSOCIATE_TAG` are all from your Amazon Associate Account.

## Features

* [x] Compatible with Python versions 2.4 and up
* [x] Support for AU, BR, CA, CN, DE, ES, FR, IN, IT, JP, MX, UK, and US Amazon Product Advertising API endpoints
* [x] No requirements, except simplejson for Python versions before 2.6
* [x] Configurable query parsing
* [x] Configurable throttling for batches of queries
* [x] Configurable query caching
* [x] Configurable error handling and retries

## Usage

### [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/)

    pip install bottlenose

or

    python3 -m pip install bottlenose

Then, using your `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, and `AWS_ASSOCIATE_TAG`:

```python
import bottlenose
amazon = bottlenose.Amazon(AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY, AWS_ASSOCIATE_TAG)
response = amazon.ItemLookup(ItemId=""B007OZNUCE"")
```

You can then parse the `response` output to view item information.

## Troubleshooting

* If you need help or would like to ask a general question, use [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/bottlenose). Apply the 'bottlenose' tag to your question to get help faster.
* If you found a bug or have a feature request, open an issue.
* If you want to contribute, submit a pull request. If it's a big change, please open an issue first to discuss implementation.

## Advanced Usage

#### 1. Available Search Methods

##### Region Endpoint

The default `Region` is set to `US` (`webservices.amazon.com`). To specify another endpoint,
simply set the `Region` parameter with the request. For example, to specify the French
endpoint (`webservices.amazon.fr`), set the Region parameter to `FR`:

```python
amazon = bottlenose.Amazon(AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY, AWS_ASSOCIATE_TAG, Region='FR')
```
Supported values for the Region parameter are `CA`, `CN`, `DE`, `ES`, `FR`, `IN`, `IT`, `JP`, `UK`, and `US` (default).

Your Amazon Product Advertising account (`AWS_ASSOCIATE_TAG`) must exist for the given endpoint, otherwise, you'll get an HTTP 400 error ('Bad Request').

##### Search for a Specific Item

```python
response = amazon.ItemLookup(ItemId=""B007OZNUCE"")
```

##### Search for Items by Keywords

```python
response = amazon.ItemSearch(Keywords=""Kindle 3G"", SearchIndex=""All"")
```

##### Search for Images for an item

```python
response = amazon.ItemLookup(ItemId=""1449372422"", ResponseGroup=""Images"")
```

##### Search for Similar Items

```python
response = amazon.SimilarityLookup(ItemId=""B007OZNUCE"")
```

#### 2. Available Shopping Related Methods

##### Required

```python
amazon = bottlenose.Amazon(AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY, AWS_ASSOCIATE_TAG)
```

##### Create a cart

```python
response = amazon.CartCreate(...)
```

##### Adding to a cart

```python
response = amazon.CartAdd(CartId, ...)
```

##### Get a cart by ID

```python
response = amazon.CartGet(CartId, ...)
```

##### Modifying a cart

```python
response = amazon.CartModify(ASIN, CartId,...)
```

##### Clearing a cart

```python
response = amazon.CartClear(CartId, ...)
```

#### 3. Sample Code

```python
import bottlenose
amazon = bottlenose.Amazon(AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY, AWS_ASSOCIATE_TAG)
response = amazon.ItemLookup(ItemId=""0596520999"", ResponseGroup=""Images"",
    SearchIndex=""Books"", IdType=""ISBN"")
print(response)
# <?xml version=""1.0"" ?><ItemLookupResponse xmlns=""http://webservices.amazon...
```

Here is another example.

```python
response = amazon.ItemSearch(Keywords=""Kindle 3G"", SearchIndex=""All"")
# <?xml version=""1.0"" ?><ItemSearchResponse xmlns=""http://webservices.amazon...
```

Bottlenose can also read your credentials from the environment automatically;
just set `$AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `$AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` and
`$AWS_ASSOCIATE_TAG`.

Any valid API call from the following is supported (in addition to any others
that may be added in the future). Just plug in appropriate request parameters
for the operation you'd like to call, and you're good to go.

    BrowseNodeLookup
    CartAdd
    CartClear
    CartCreate
    CartGet
    CartModify
    ItemLookup
    ItemSearch
    SimilarityLookup

You can refer here for a full listing of API calls to be made from Amazon.
- [Amazon API Quick Reference Card](http://s3.amazonaws.com/awsdocs/Associates/latest/prod-adv-api-qrc.pdf)

-------

For more information about these calls, please consult the [Product Advertising
API Developer Guide](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSECommerceService/latest/DG/Welcome.html).

## Parsing

By default, API calls return the response as a raw bytestring. You can change
this with the `Parser` constructor argument. The parser is a callable that
takes a single argument, the response as a raw bytestring, and returns the
parsed response in a format of your choice.

For example, to parse responses with BeautifulSoup:

```python
import bottlenose
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

amazon = bottlenose.Amazon(
    AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY, AWS_ASSOCIATE_TAG,
    Parser=lambda text: BeautifulSoup(text, 'xml')
)
results = amazon.ItemLookup(ItemId=""0198596790"", ResponseGroup=""SalesRank"")

print(results.find('SalesRank').string)
# 168088
```

## Throttling/Batch Mode

Amazon strictly limits the query rate on its API (by default, one query
per second per associate tag). If you have a batch of non-urgent queries, you
can use the `MaxQPS` argument to limit them to no more than a certain rate;
any faster, and bottlenose will `sleep()` until it is time to make the next
API call.

Generally, you want to be just under the query limit, for example:

```python
amazon = bottlenose.Amazon(MaxQPS=0.9)
```

If some other code is also querying the API with your associate tag (for
example, a website backend), you'll want to choose an even lower value
for MaxQPS.

## Caching

You can often get a major speedup by caching API queries. Use the `CacheWriter`
and `CacheReader` constructor arguments.

`CacheWriter` is a callable that takes two arguments, a cache url, and the
raw response (a bytestring). It will only be called after successful queries.

`CacheReader` is a callable that takes a single argument, a cache url, and
returns a (cached) raw response, or `None` if there is nothing cached.

The cache url is the actual query URL with authentication information removed.
For example:

    http://webservices.amazon.com/onca/xml?Keywords=vacuums&Operation=ItemSearch&Region=US&ResponseGroup=SearchBins&SearchIndex=All&Service=AWSECommerceService&Version=2013-08-01

Example code:

```python
def write_query_to_db(cache_url, data):
    ...

def read_query_from_db(cache_url):
    ...

amazon = bottlenose.Amazon(CacheWriter=write_query_to_db,
                           CacheReader=read_query_from_db)
```

Note that Amazon's [Product Advertising API Agreement](https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/gp/advertising/api/detail/agreement.html)
only allows you to cache queries for up to 24 hours.

## Error Handling

Sometimes the Amazon API returns errors; for example, if you have gone over
your query limit, you'll get a 503. The `ErrorHandler` constructor argument
gives you a way to keep track of such errors, and to retry queries when you
receive a transient error.

`ErrorHandler` should be a callable that takes a single argument, a dictionary
with these keys:

 * api_url: the actual URL used to call the API
 * cache_url: `api_url` minus authentication information
 * exception: the exception raised (usually an `HTTPError` or `URLError`)

If your `ErrorHandler` returns true, the query will be retried. Here's some
example code that does exponential backoff after throttling:

```python
import random
import time
from urllib2 import HTTPError

def error_handler(err):
    ex = err['exception']
    if isinstance(ex, HTTPError) and ex.code == 503:
        time.sleep(random.expovariate(0.1))
        return True

amazon = bottlenose.Amazon(ErrorHandler=error_handler)
```

C-REAL is currently the **FASTEST** and **FREE** open source nuke bot out here. All commands will be focused on nuking-related.

Join our discord if you need help, see plans for the future updates, suggestions, or beta testing a newer version of the bot: [https://discord.gg/REMwN7s68S](https://discord.gg/REMwN7s68S)

We have combined threading, queue, requests, and discord.py API to make the commands run as fast as possible. If you are seeing rate limiting logged in your console while using this script, then that is simply because <ins>it runs too fast</ins>.

Python version 3.8.0 or higher is required if you are going to run the file from source code.

[All 51 commands](manual.md)

```
[addRole] [addChannel] [autoNick] [addVoiceChannel] [autoStatus] 
[addEmoji] [addCategory] [banAll] [bans] [ban] [channelBomb] 
[categoryBomb] [config] [checkRolePermissions] [connect] [categories] 
[changeStatus] [channels] [deleteRole] [deleteChannel] 
[deleteVoiceChannel] [deleteCategory] [deleteCC] [deleteEmoji] 
[deleteAllRoles] [deleteAllChannels] [disableCommunityMode] 
[deleteAllEmojis] [deleteAllWebhooks] [emojis] [grantAllPerm] 
[help] [joinNuke] [kaboom] [leave] [leaveAll] [link] [moveRole] 
[members] [nuke] [off] [purge] [roles] [roleBomb] [roleTo] [servers] 
[serverIcon] [serverName] [unban] [voiceChannels] [webhook] 
```

# IMPORTANT: 
* We will not take any responsibility over whatever you are going to do with this bot.
* The bot will still have to obey the [server limitings](https://discordia.me/en/server-limits) because of that in discord, there are rate limitings. You will see a lot of rate limiting in the console while using some commands. (because the bot is too fast on creating or deleting.)
* Also, since we are using HTTP requests, unlike other nuke bot out there, C-REAL spam creating channel, role, and category(CRC) can create beyond the 250 limit for CRC that the old nuking bots have.

## Messages
* cyxl: wow.

* Message to those coding masters out there, if you see something we can improve in our code, feel free to make a pull request. This will really help us a lot. ╰(✿´⌣\`✿)╯♡

* TKperson: I got the idea of creating the C-REAL bot from [Cerealwithnomilk](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxX7O68badw2sBbcvQK0wBQ); the bot is named after this guy.

## Immigrate from verision 2.3.x to 2.4.0
1. Make a new folder named ""data"" next to your c-realv2.exe or c-realV2.py file
2. put your old default.json into the data folder
3. start running the bot again.

## Why did my computer say it's a dangerous file/containing virus?
* I'm going to make myself clear here - it's not a virus.
* There is another way for people that don't trust the released versions, and dont't want to download python to run the bot. Use https://repl.it/, make an account, choose ""new repl"" in the top left corner, choose python, click ""create repl"", copy and paste the [source code](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TKperson/Nuking-Discord-Server-Bot-Nuke-Bot/master/c-realV2.py) into repl, and click on the run button at the top.  

## Main Usage (Please read `.config` command below before contacting me)
`.nuke <true or false>` - It's a combination of a few commands: `.deleteAllChannels`, `.deleteAllEmojis`, `.deleteAllRoles`, `.banAll`, and `.deleteAllWebhooks`. True or false is an optional argument that is set to true by default and used for disabling after commands. (This command doesn't need to be configed with `.config`, Note: you can also use all the commands listed above seperately)
* `.kaboom <#of bombs> <wordlist>` - Mass create text channels, roles, and categories(CRC). Number of bombs is just how many CRCs you want to spam create. There are 3 word lists, 2 built in, and 1 from user inputs: `fixed` - random text chosen from user inputs, `b64` - random base64 characters, `an` -  random alphanumeral characters. (Use `.config bomb_messages <args...>` to see how to set up the bomb commands)
* `.check <userID|tag,|ping>` - Checks for the permissions that the bot has in a server.
* `.autoNick` - Nicks the bot itselfs every few moments to bounce around the member list, making it harder for admins to kick the bot.
* `.autoStatus` - changes from online to offline and offline to online every few moments to bounce around the member list.
* `.config <feature> <args...>` - if you just type out `.config` it will show you all the features that you can config and it will guide you with text in the `.config` command. For example, if you want to add webhook spammer names to config webhook spam, you first want to type `.config webhook_spam`. The bot will send out a description of the webhook_spam feature and the config commands you can use to config the webhook_spam feature. From there you should be able to find something like `webhook <type> add <text>` for adding something into the `<type>` in this case you want to choose the username for the spammers, so you can type `.config webhook_spam usernames add TKperson` for adding usernames to  webhook_spam.

## Guides
### 2.4 setup
* Run the .exe or the .py
* You will see the ""Enter token"" message. You can enter a selfbot token or normal bot token
* Next you will see ""Enter user ID or tag"", you should enter the user ID or tag that you wanted to command the bot with. All command permissions will be granted to the user with the ID or tag you entered here.
* If you want to know what commmands are there, then run `.help`
* If you want to config any settings like the after commands or the webhook spam commands, you have to use `.config`. For more information on how to config will be in the `.config` command.
* If you are having problems, feel free to make a issue in this github page.  

### 2.4 tutorials

* [kaboom and nuke](https://youtu.be/PkPsdUHFhXI)
* [How to use the config command](https://youtu.be/Ci2Ly5yhT-U)

## Problems/issues
* If you are experiencing crashing, please report it to ""issues"" on the [github page](https://github.com/TKperson/Nuking-Discord-Server-Bot-Nuke-Bot).
* If the bot doesn't respond to any of the commands, check if the console is in highlighting/mark mode. If it's highlighting/mark mode, click the console then press any key on your keyboard, and it'll resolve.
* If you see a bunch of white worded errors displaying in the console, and then crashed that means it's 90% a bug. So please make a new issue about it.

238,238,LeoWuVinci/agar.io-bot,JavaScript,"# UPDATE 2021 - DO NOT USE.  
This framework was built to foster an environment where players and bots can live together. 
It encouraged the possibility of a client-side API where players and bots played on equal ground.  A WIN-WIN situation.

As proof where real players and bots can coexist, look no further than MOBA minions, Titanfall, and ALMOST EVERY SINGLE PLAYER GAME.

Instead, the agario team actively created obstacles.  Thereby encouraged communicating directly with the server protocol
which encourages a feeder-bot community that is always fighting with the game devs. A LOSE-LOSE situation.


# agario-bot-framework
Agar.io Bot Framework for others to create their own bots.

*Hacks? Cheats?* None of that here. Just bots trying to get along with humans.

You can try out the sample bot included for **free in the [chrome store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/agario-bot-framework/jlnlogedhgopimklhbhmpnliaclegdhg)**.

Even though the bot included has many different algorithms such
as genetic algorithms and velocity prediction, it is just
an example and isn't optimized to get on the leaderboard.
Please consider it as a sample of what is possible.

Feel free to fork this project and create your own custom bot

See the latest bot in action as well as development while streaming at

http://twitch.tv/gamerlio or http://livecoding.tv/heyitsleo

## How to Install from GitHub
1. Click the ""Download ZIP"" button on the right panel of https://github.com/leomwu/agario-bot
2. Unzip anywhere you want.
3. Go to ""chrome://extensions"" in your chrome browser
4. Checkbox ""Developer mode""
5. Click on ""Load unpacked extension..."" and find your unzipped file and go to the ""src"" folder

Now you can see it in action when you go to agar.io

If you modify the script, remember to reload the extension.

## Purpose
The purpose of this bot is to explore decision-making based on statistics instead of
hard-coded rules.  This is not a bot to enhance normal gameplay.  There's also no team-related features.  Considerations should be fairly simple and not need to consider more than one other organism at a time.  This effectly excludes any ""advance"" strategies.  The code is designed to be
""forked"" easily so everything is kept at the bare necessities.  If you want to (for example)
create a better pathfinder, forking the code would be the best choice.

## Main Components
* Binding to Original Game Code
* Action Generators - Generates move, split, and shoot actions.
* Considerations - Game strategies broken down into small pieces.
* Distance-Delayed Best-First Searching
* Bot Intuition - Weighted Averages of considerations.

### How can the bot be improved?
1. Datastructure for making more advance proximity-based considerations
2. More action generators
3. More consideration functions

### Fun Fork Ideas
* Hide'n'seek
* Sniper
* Bet the score
* VIP

[![Python Test](https://github.com/ShailChoksi/lichess-bot/actions/workflows/python-test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ShailChoksi/lichess-bot/actions/workflows/python-test.yml)

A bridge between [Lichess Bot API](https://lichess.org/api#tag/Bot) and bots.

## How to Install
### Mac/Linux:
- **NOTE: Only Python 3.7 or later is supported!**
- Download the repo into lichess-bot directory.
- Navigate to the directory in cmd/Terminal: `cd lichess-bot`.
- Install pip: `apt install python3-pip`.
- Install virtualenv: `pip install virtualenv`.
- Setup virtualenv: `apt install python3-venv`.
```python
python3 -m venv venv # If this fails you probably need to add Python3 to your PATH.
virtualenv venv -p python3 # If this fails you probably need to add Python3 to your PATH.
source ./venv/bin/activate
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
- Copy `config.yml.default` to `config.yml`.
- Edit the variants: `supported_variants` and time controls: `supported_tc` from the `config.yml` file as necessary.

### Windows:
- [Here is a video on how to install the bot](https://youtu.be/w-aJFk00POQ). Or you may proceed to the following steps.
- **NOTE: Only Python 3.7 or later is supported!**
- If you don't have Python, you may [download it here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). When installing it, enable ""add Python to PATH"", then go to custom installation (this may be not necessary, but on some computers it won't work otherwise) and enable all options (especially ""install for all users""), except the last. It's better to install Python in a path without spaces, like ""C:\Python\"".
- To type commands it's better to use PowerShell. Go to Start menu and type ""PowerShell"" (you may use ""cmd"" too, but sometimes it may not work).
- Then you may need to upgrade pip. Execute `python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip` in PowerShell.
- Download the repo into lichess-bot directory.
- Navigate to the directory in PowerShell: `cd [folder's adress]` (example, `cd C:\chess\lichess-bot`).
- Install virtualenv: `pip install virtualenv`.
- Setup virtualenv:
```python
python3 -m venv .venv # If this fails you probably need to add Python3 to your PATH.
./.venv/Scripts/Activate.ps1 # `.\.venv\Scripts\activate.bat` should work in cmd in administator mode. This may not work on Windows, and in this case you need to execute ""Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned"" first and choose ""Y"" there (you may need to run Powershell as administrator). After you executed the script, change execution policy back with ""Set-ExecutionPolicy Restricted"" and pressing ""Y"".
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
- Copy `config.yml.default` to `config.yml`.
- Edit the variants: `supported_variants` and time controls: `supported_tc` from the `config.yml` file as necessary (use ""#"" to disable certain ones).

## Lichess OAuth
- Create an account for your bot on [Lichess.org](https://lichess.org/signup).
- **NOTE: If you have previously played games on an existing account, you will not be able to use it as a bot account.**
- Once your account has been created and you are logged in, [create a personal OAuth2 token with the ""Play games with the bot API"" ('bot:play') scope](https://lichess.org/account/oauth/token/create?scopes[]=bot:play&description=lichess-bot) selected and a description added.
- A `token` (e.g. `xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`) will be displayed. Store this in the `config.yml` file as the `token` field. You can also set the token in the environment variable `$LICHESS_BOT_TOKEN`.
- **NOTE: You won't see this token again on Lichess, so do save it.**

## Setup Engine
Within the file `config.yml`:
- Enter the directory containing the engine executable in the `engine: dir` field.
- Enter the executable name in the `engine: name` field (In Windows you may need to type a name with "".exe"", like ""lczero.exe"")
- If you want the engine to run in a different directory (e.g., if the engine needs to read or write files at a certain location), enter that directory in the `engine: working_dir` field.
  - If this field is blank or missing, the current directory will be used.
- Leave the `weights` field empty or see [LeelaChessZero section](#leelachesszero) for Neural Nets

As an optional convenience, there is a folder named `engines` within the lichess-bot folder where you can copy your engine and all the files it needs. This is the default executable location in the `config.yml.default` file.

### Engine Configuration
Besides the above, there are many possible options within `config.yml` for configuring the engine for use with lichess-bot.

- `protocol`: Specify which protocol your engine uses. Choices are
    1. `""uci""` for the [Universal Chess Interface](http://wbec-ridderkerk.nl/html/UCIProtocol.html)
    2. `""xboard""` for the XBoard/WinBoard/[Chess Engine Communication Protocol](https://www.gnu.org/software/xboard/engine-intf.html)
    3. `""homemade""` if you want to write your own engine in Python within lichess-bot. See [**Creating a homemade bot**](#creating-a-homemade-bot) below.
- `ponder`: Specify whether your bot will ponder--i.e., think while the bot's opponent is choosing a move.
- `polyglot`: Tell lichess-bot whether your bot should use an opening book. Multiple books can be specified for each chess variant.
    - `enabled`: Whether to use the book at all.
    - `book`: A nested list of books. The next indented line should list a chess variant (`standard`, `3check`, `horde`, etc.) followed on succeeding indented lines with paths to the book files. See `config.yml.default` for examples.
- `draw_or_resign`: This section allows your bot to resign or offer/accept draw based on the evaluation by the engine. XBoard engines can resign and offer/accept draw without this feature enabled.
    - `resign_enabled`: Whether the bot is allowed to resign based on the evaluation.
    - `resign_score`: The engine evaluation has to be less than or equal to `resign_score` for the bot to resign.
    - `resign_for_egtb_minus_two`: If true the bot will resign in positions where the online_egtb returns a wdl of -2.
    - `resign_moves`: The evaluation has to be less than or equal to `resign_score` for `resign_moves` amount of moves for the bot to resign.
    - `offer_draw_enabled`: Whether the bot is allowed to offer/accept draw based on the evaluation.
    - `offer_draw_score`: The absolute value of the engine evaluation has to be less than or equal to `offer_draw_score` for the bot to offer/accept draw.
    - `offer_draw_for_egtb_zero`: If true the bot will offer/accept draw in positions where the online_egtb returns a wdl of 0.
    - `offer_draw_moves`: The absolute value of the evaluation has to be less than or equal to `offer_draw_score` for `offer_draw_moves` amount of moves for the bot to offer/accept draw.
    - `offer_draw_pieces`: The bot only offers/accepts draws if the position has less than or equal to `offer_draw_pieces` pieces.
- `online_moves`: This section gives your bot access to various online resources for choosing moves like opening books and endgame tablebases. This can be a supplement or a replacement for chess databases stored on your computer. There are three sections that correspond to three different online databases:
    1. `chessdb_book`: Consults a [Chinese chess position database](https://www.chessdb.cn/), which also hosts a xiangqi database.
    2. `lichess_cloud_analysis`: Consults [Lichess' own position analysis database](https://lichess.org/api#operation/apiCloudEval).
    3. `online_egtb`: Consults either the online Syzygy 7-piece endgame tablebase [hosted by Lichess](https://lichess.org/blog/W3WeMyQAACQAdfAL/7-piece-syzygy-tablebases-are-complete) or the chessdb listed above.
    - Configurations common to all:
        - `enabled`: Whether to use the database at all.
        - `min_time`: The minimum time in seconds on the game clock necessary to allow the online database to be consulted.
    - Configurations only in `chessdb_book` and `lichess_cloud_analysis`:
        - `move_quality`: Choice of `""all""` (`chessdb_book` only), `""good""`, or `""best""`.
            - `all`: Choose a random move from all legal moves.
            - `best`: Choose only the highest scoring move.
            - `good`: Choose randomly from the top moves. In `lichess_cloud_analysis`, the top moves list is controlled by `max_score_difference`. In `chessdb_book`, the top list is controlled by the online source.
        - `min_depth`: The minimum search depth for a move evaluation for a database move to be accepted.
    - Configurations only in `chessdb_book`:
        - `contribute`: Send the current board position to chessdb for later analysis.
    - Configurations only in `lichess_cloud_analysis`:
        - `max_score_difference`: When `move_quality` is set to `""good""`, this option specifices the maximum difference between the top scoring move and any other move that will make up the set from which a move will be chosen randomly. If this options is set to 25 and the top move in a position has a score of 100, no move with a score of less than 75 will be returned.
        - `min_knodes`: The minimum number of kilonodes to search. The minimum number of nodes to search is this value times 1000.
    - Configurations only in `online_egtb`:
        -  `max_pieces`: The maximum number of pieces in the current board for which the tablebase will be consulted.
        - `source`: One of `chessdb` or `lichess`. Lichess also has tablebases for atomic and antichess while chessdb only has those for standard.
- `engine_options`: Command line options to pass to the engine on startup. For example, the `config.yml.default` has the configuration
```yml
  engine_options:
    cpuct: 3.1
```
This would create the command-line option `--cpuct=3.1` to be used when starting the engine, like this for the engine lc0: `lc0 --cpuct=3.1`. Any number of options can be listed here, each getting their own command-line option.
- `uci_options`: A list of options to pass to a UCI engine after startup. Different engines have different options, so treat the options in `config.yml.default` as templates and not suggestions. When UCI engines start, they print a list of configurations that can modify their behavior after receiving the string ""uci"". For example, to find out what options Stockfish 13 supports, run the executable in a terminal, type `uci`, and press Enter. The engine will print the following when run at the command line:
```
id name Stockfish 13
id author the Stockfish developers (see AUTHORS file)

option name Debug Log File type string default
option name Contempt type spin default 24 min -100 max 100
option name Analysis Contempt type combo default Both var Off var White var Black var Both
option name Threads type spin default 1 min 1 max 512
option name Hash type spin default 16 min 1 max 33554432
option name Clear Hash type button
option name Ponder type check default false
option name MultiPV type spin default 1 min 1 max 500
option name Skill Level type spin default 20 min 0 max 20
option name Move Overhead type spin default 10 min 0 max 5000
option name Slow Mover type spin default 100 min 10 max 1000
option name nodestime type spin default 0 min 0 max 10000
option name UCI_Chess960 type check default false
option name UCI_AnalyseMode type check default false
option name UCI_LimitStrength type check default false
option name UCI_Elo type spin default 1350 min 1350 max 2850
option name UCI_ShowWDL type check default false
option name SyzygyPath type string default <empty>
option name SyzygyProbeDepth type spin default 1 min 1 max 100
option name Syzygy50MoveRule type check default true
option name SyzygyProbeLimit type spin default 7 min 0 max 7
option name Use NNUE type check default true
option name EvalFile type string default nn-62ef826d1a6d.nnue
uciok
```
Any of the names following `option name` can be listed in `uci_options` in order to configure the Stockfish engine.
```yml
  uci_options:
    Move Overhead: 100
    Skill Level: 10
```
The exception to this are the options `uci_chess960`, `uci_variant`, `multipv`, and `ponder`. These will be handled by lichess-bot after a game starts and should not be listed in `config.yml`. Also, if an option is listed under `uci_options` that is not in the list printed by the engine, it will cause an error when the engine starts because the engine won't understand the option. The word after `type` indicates the expected type of the options: `string` for a text string, `spin` for a numeric value, `check` for a boolean True/False value.

One last option is `go_commands`. Beneath this option, arguments to the UCI `go` command can be passed. For example,
```yml
  go_commands:
    nodes: 1
    depth: 5
    movetime: 1000
```
will append `nodes 1 depth 5 movetime 1000` to the command to start thinking of a move: `go startpos e2e4 e7e5 ...`.

- `xboard_options`: A list of options to pass to an XBoard engine after startup. Different engines have different options, so treat the options in `config.yml.default` as templates and not suggestions. When XBoard engines start, they print a list of configurations that can modify their behavior. To see these configurations, run the engine in a terminal, type `xboard`, press Enter, type `protover 2`, and press Enter. The configurable options will be prefixed with `feature option`. Some examples may include
```
feature option=""Add Noise -check VALUE""
feature option=""PGN File -string VALUE""
feature option=""CPU Count -spin VALUE MIN MAX""`
```
Any of the options can be listed under `xboard_options` in order to configure the XBoard engine.
```yml
  xboard_options:
    Add Noise: False
    PGN File: lichess_games.pgn
    CPU Count: 1
```
The exceptions to this are the options `multipv`, and `ponder`. These will be handled by lichess-bot after a game starts and should not be listed in `config.yml`. Also, if an option is listed under `xboard_options` that is not in the list printed by the engine, it will cause an error when the engine starts because the engine won't know how to handle the option. The word prefixed with a hyphen indicates the expected type of the options: `-string` for a text string, `-spin` for a numeric value, `-check` for a boolean True/False value.

One last option is `go_commands`. Beneath this option, commands prior to the `go` command can be passed. For example,
```yml
  go_commands:
    depth: 5
```
will precede the `go` command to start thinking with `sd 5`. The other `go_commands` list above for UCI engines (`nodes` and `movetime`) are not valid for XBoard engines and will detrimentally affect their time control.

- `abort_time`: How many seconds to wait before aborting a game due to opponent inaction. This only applies during the first six moves of the game.
- `fake_think_time`: Artificially slow down the engine to simulate a person thinking about a move. The amount of thinking time decreases as the game goes on.
- `rate_limiting_delay`: For extremely fast games, the lichess.org servers may respond with an error if too many moves are played to quickly. This option avoids this problem by pausing for a specified number of milliseconds after submitting a move before making the next move.
- `move_overhead`: To prevent losing on time due to network lag, subtract this many milliseconds from the time to think on each move.

- `correspondence` These options control how the engine behaves during correspondence games.
  - `move_time`: How many seconds to think for each move.
  - `checkin_period`: How often (in seconds) to reconnect to games to check for new moves after disconnecting.
  - `disconnect_time`: How many seconds to wait after the bot makes a move for an opponent to make a move. If no move is made during the wait, disconnect from the game.
  - `ponder`: Whether the bot should ponder during the above waiting period.

- `challenge`: Control what kind of games for which the bot should accept challenges. All of the following options must be satisfied by a challenge to be accepted.
  - `concurrency`: The maximum number of games to play simultaneously.
  - `sort_by`: Whether to start games by the best rated/titled opponent `""best""` or by first-come-first-serve `""first""`.
  - `accept_bot`: Whether to accept challenges from other bots.
  - `only_bot`: Whether to only accept challenges from other bots.
  - `max_increment`: The maximum value of time increment.
  - `min_increment`: The minimum value of time increment.
  - `max_base`: The maximum base time for a game.
  - `min_base`: The minimum base time for a game.
  - `variants`: An indented list of chess variants that the bot can handle.
```yml
  variants:
    - standard
    - horde
    - antichess
    # etc.
```
  - `time_controls`: An indented list of acceptable time control types from `bullet` to `correspondence`.
```yml
  time_controls:
    - bullet
    - blitz
    - rapid
    - classical
    - correpondence
```
  - `modes`: An indented list of acceptable game modes (`rated` and/or `casual`).
```yml
  modes:
    -rated
    -casual
```
  - `greeting`: Send messages via chat to the bot's opponent. The string `{me}` will be replaced by the bot's lichess account name. The string `{opponent}` will be replaced by the opponent's lichess account name. Any other word between curly brackets will be removed. If you want to put a curly bracket in the message, use two: `{{` or `}}`.
    - `hello`: Message to send to opponent before the bot makes its first move.
    - `goodbye`: Message to send to opponent once the game is over.
```yml
  greeting:
    hello: Hi, {opponent}! I'm {me}. Good luck!
    goodbye: Good game!
```

## Lichess Upgrade to Bot Account
**WARNING: This is irreversible. [Read more about upgrading to bot account](https://lichess.org/api#operation/botAccountUpgrade).**
- run `python3 lichess-bot.py -u`.

## To Run
After activating the virtual environment created in the installation steps (the `source` line for Linux and Macs or the `activate` script for Windows), run
```
python3 lichess-bot.py
```
The working directory for the engine execution will be the lichess-bot directory. If your engine requires files located elsewhere, make sure they are specified by absolute path or copy the files to an appropriate location inside the lichess-bot directory.

To output more information (including your engine's thinking output and debugging information), the `-v` option can be passed to lichess-bot:
```
python3 lichess-bot.py -v
```

## To Quit
- Press `CTRL+C`.
- It may take some time to quit.

## <a name=""leelachesszero""></a> LeelaChessZero: Mac/Linux
- Download the weights for the id you want to play from [here](https://lczero.org/play/networks/bestnets/).
- Extract the weights from the zip archive and rename it to `latest.txt`.
- For Mac/Linux, build the lczero binary yourself following [LeelaChessZero/lc0/README](https://github.com/LeelaChessZero/lc0/blob/master/README.md).
- Copy both the files into the `engine.dir` directory.
- Change the `engine.name` and `engine.engine_options.weights` keys in `config.yml` file to `lczero` and `weights.pb.gz`.
- You can specify the number of `engine.uci_options.threads` in the `config.yml` file as well.
- To start: `python3 lichess-bot.py`.

## LeelaChessZero: Windows CPU 2021
- For Windows modern CPUs, download the lczero binary from the [latest Lc0 release](https://github.com/LeelaChessZero/lc0/releases) (e.g. `lc0-v0.27.0-windows-cpu-dnnl.zip`).
- Unzip the file, it comes with `lc0.exe` , `dnnl.dll`, and a weights file example, `703810.pb.gz` (amongst other files).
- All three main files need to be copied to the engines directory.
- The `lc0.exe` should be doubleclicked and the windows safesearch warning about it being unsigned should be cleared (be careful and be sure you have the genuine file).
- Change the `engine.name` key in the `config.yml` file to `lc0.exe`, no need to edit the `config.yml` file concerning the weights file as the `lc0.exe` will use whatever `*.pb.gz` is in the same folder (have only one `*pb.gz` file in the engines directory).
- To start: `python3 lichess-bot.py`.

## LeelaChessZero: Docker container
Use https://github.com/vochicong/lc0-nvidia-docker to easily run lc0 and lichess-bot inside a Docker container.

## <a name=""creating-a-homemade-bot""></a> Creating a homemade bot
As an alternative to creating an entire chess engine and implementing one of the communiciation protocols (`UCI` or `XBoard`), a bot can also be created by writing a single class with a single method. The `search()` method in this new class takes the current board and the game clock as arguments and should return a move based on whatever criteria the coder desires.

Steps to create a homemade bot:

1. Do all the steps in the [How to Install](#how-to-install)
2. In the `config.yml`, change the engine protocol to `homemade`
3. Create a class in some file that extends `MinimalEngine` (in `strategies.py`).
    - Look at the `strategies.py` file to see some examples.
    - If you don't know what to implement, look at the `EngineWrapper` or `UCIEngine` class.
        - You don't have to create your own engine, even though it's an ""EngineWrapper"" class.<br>
The examples just implement `search`.
4. In the `config.yml`, change the name from `engine_name` to the name of your class
    - In this case, you could change it to:

        `name: ""RandomMove""`

## Tips & Tricks
- You can specify a different config file with the `--config` argument.
- Here's an example systemd service definition:
```ini
[Unit]
Description=lichess-bot
After=network-online.target
Wants=network-online.target

[Service]
Environment=""PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1""
ExecStart=/usr/bin/python3 /home/thibault/lichess-bot/lichess-bot.py
WorkingDirectory=/home/thibault/lichess-bot/
User=thibault
Group=thibault
Restart=always

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

```
- Remove the first line saying:
```
_____REMOVE_THIS_LINE_____=True
```
Fill up rest of the fields. Meaning of each fields are discussed below:
### Required Field
- `BOT_TOKEN`: The Telegram bot token that you get from [`@BotFather`](https://t.me/BotFather)
- `TELEGRAM_API`: This is to authenticate to your Telegram account for downloading Telegram files. You can get this from [`telegram.org`](https://my.telegram.org) DO NOT put this in quotes.
- `TELEGRAM_HASH`: This is to authenticate to your Telegram account for downloading Telegram files. You can get this from [`telegram.org`](https://my.telegram.org)
- `OWNER_ID`: The Telegram user ID (not username) of the Owner of the bot
- `GDRIVE_FOLDER_ID`: This is the folder ID of the Google Drive Folder to which you want to upload all the mirrors.
- `DOWNLOAD_DIR`: The path to the local folder where the downloads should be downloaded to
- `DOWNLOAD_STATUS_UPDATE_INTERVAL`: A short interval of time in seconds after which the Mirror progress message is updated. (I recommend to keep it `5` seconds at least)  
- `AUTO_DELETE_MESSAGE_DURATION`: Interval of time (in seconds), after which the bot deletes it's message (and command message) which is expected to be viewed instantly. (**Note**: Set to `-1` to never automatically delete messages)
### Optional Field
- `ACCOUNTS_ZIP_URL`: Only if you want to load your Service Account externally from an Index Link. Archive your Service Account json files to a zip file directly (don't archive the accounts folder. Select all the jsons inside and zip them only instead. Name the zip file with whatever you want, it doesn't matter). Fill this with the direct link of that file.
- `TOKEN_PICKLE_URL`: Only if you want to load your **token.pickle** externally from an Index Link. Fill this with the direct link of that file.
- `MULTI_SEARCH_URL`: To use search/list in multiple TD/folder. Run `driveid.py` in your terminal and follow it. It will generate a file `drive_folder` when you finish. Upload that file [`here`](https://gist.github.com/) with the same file name. Open the raw file of that gist, it's URL will be your required config. Check wiki for gist related help. 
- `DATABASE_URL`: Your Database URL. See [`Generate Database`](https://github.com/vincreator/eunhamirror/tree/master#generate-database) to generate database (**NOTE**: If you use database you can save your sudo id permanent using `/addsudo` command).

## Deploying on Heroku with Github Workflows.
<details>
    <summary><b>Click here for more details</b></summary>
    
## Pre-requisites

- [`token.pickle`](https://github.com/vincreator/eunhamirror#getting-google-oauth-api-credential-file)
- [`Heroku`](https://heroku.com) accounts
- Recommended to use 1 App in 1 Heroku account
- **First before going to deployment,** you must create app on your heroku account [HERE](https://dashboard.heroku.com/new-app) Choose region by you like, Name should only contain lowercase letters, numbers, dashes, and must be unique.

- Don't use bin/fake credits card, because your Heroku account will get banned.

## Deployment

1. Give a star and Fork this repo then upload **token.pickle** to your forks, or you can upload your **token.pickle** to your Index and put your **token.pickle** link to `TOKEN_PICKLE_URL` (**NOTE**: If you don't upload **token.pickle** uploading will not work).

2. Go to Repository `Settings` -> `Secrets`

	![secrets](https://telegra.ph/file/bb8cb0eced5caad68a41b.jpg)

3. Add the below Required Variables one by one by clicking `New Repository Secret` everytime.

	* `HEROKU_API_KEY` Your Heroku API key, get it from [`Dasboard Heroku`](https://dashboard.heroku.com/account)
	* `HEROKU_APP_NAME` See above, on Pre-requisites
	* `CONFIG_FILE_URL` Fill [`This`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vincreator/eunhamirror/master/config_sample.env) in any text editor. Remove the `_____REMOVE_THIS_LINE_____=True` line and fill the variables. Go to [`Gist`](https://gist.github.com) and paste your config data. Rename the file to `config.env` then create secret gist. Click on Raw, copy the link. This will be your `CONFIG_FILE_URL`. Refer to below images for clarity. 

	![steps 1 to 5](https://telegra.ph/file/ec56f647ee556e86f6c7d.png)
	
- **NOTE**: Remove commit id from raw link to be able to change variables without updating the `CONFIG_FILE_URL` in secrets.
  should be in this form: `https://gist.githubusercontent.com/username/gist-id/raw/config.env`
  - Before: `https://gist.githubusercontent.com/vincreator/ab5b0cb5d73f8992590ac732f0780f5c/raw/fe8162eddaec32d2408024efdf9ea8fc70028ed9/config.env`
  - After: `https://gist.githubusercontent.com/vincreator/ab5b0cb5d73f8992590ac732f0780f5c/raw/config.env`
  - You only need to restart your bot after editing `config.env` gist secret.

4. After adding all the above Required Variables go to Github Actions tab in your repo

5. Select `Container` workflow as shown below:

	![Container](https://telegra.ph/file/dd04efe104e618df3143a.png)

6. Then click on Run workflow

	![Run workflow](https://telegra.ph/file/b7c97424537f8638ec00a.png)

7. _Done!_ your bot will be deployed now.

## NOTE
- Don't change/edit variables from Heroku if you want to change/edit do it from `config.env`

## Using Service Accounts for uploading to avoid user rate limit
<details>
    <summary><b>Click here for more details</b></summary>

For Service Account to work, you must set **USE_SERVICE_ACCOUNTS=**""True"" in config file or environment variables, 
Many thanks to [`AutoRClone`](https://github.com/xyou365/AutoRclone) for the scripts.
**NOTE**: Using Service Accounts is only recommended while uploading to a Team Drive.
</details>

## Generate Service Accounts.
- [`What is Service Account`](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-accounts)
<details>
    <summary><b>Click here for more details</b></summary>

Let us create only the Service Accounts that we need. 
**Warning**: abuse of this feature is not the aim of this project and we do **NOT** recommend that you make a lot of projects, just one project and 100 SAs allow you plenty of use, its also possible that over abuse might get your projects banned by Google. 

**NOTE:** 1 Service Account can copy around 750gb a day, 1 project can make 100 Service Accounts so that's 75tb a day, for most users this should easily suffice.
```
python3 gen_sa_accounts.py --quick-setup 1 --new-only
```
A folder named accounts will be created which will contain keys for the Service Accounts.

Or you can create Service Accounts to current project, no need to create new one

- List your projects ids
```
python3 gen_sa_accounts.py --list-projects
```
- Enable services automatically by this command
```
python3 gen_sa_accounts.py --enable-services $PROJECTID
```
- Create Sevice Accounts to current project
```
python3 gen_sa_accounts.py --create-sas $PROJECTID
```
- Download Sevice Accounts as accounts folder
```
python3 gen_sa_accounts.py --download-keys $PROJECTID
```
If you want to add Service Accounts to Google Group, follow these steps

- Mount accounts folder
```
cd accounts
```
- Grab emails form all accounts to emails.txt file that would be created in accounts folder
```
grep -oPh '""client_email"": ""\K[^""]+' *.json > emails.txt
```
- Unmount acounts folder
```
cd -
```
Then add emails from emails.txt to Google Group, after that add Google Group to your Shared Drive and promote it to manager.

**NOTE**: If you have created SAs in past from this script, you can also just re download the keys by running:
```
python3 gen_sa_accounts.py --download-keys project_id
```

</details>

## Add all the Service Accounts to the Team Drive
<details>
    <summary><b>Click here for more details</b></summary>

- Run:
```
python3 add_to_team_drive.py -d SharedTeamDriveSrcID
```
</details>

# Youtube-dl authentication using .netrc file
<details>
    <summary><b>Click here for more details</b></summary>
    
For using your premium accounts in Youtube-dl or for protected Index Links, edit the netrc file according to following format:
```
machine host login username password my_youtube_password
```
For Index Link with only password without username, even http auth will not work, so this is the solution.
```
machine example.workers.dev password index_password
```

**NOTE**: Since this bot using yt-dlp. 
```
.netrc maybe not working at all, but if you using netrc you can notice some warning
say about using cookies option maybe since youtube have been slightly changed
```

Where host is the name of extractor (eg. Youtube, Twitch). Multiple accounts of different hosts can be added each separated by a new line.

244,244,odysseusmax/animated-lamp,Python,"# [Screenshotit_bot](https://tx.me/screenshotit_bot)

> Telegram Bot For Screenshot Generation.

## Description

An attempt to implement the screenshot generation of telegram files without downloading the entire file. Live version can be found here [@screenshotit_bot](https://tx.me/screenshotit_bot ""Screenshot Generator Bot"").

## Installation Guide

### Prerequisites

* FFmpeg.
* Python3 (3.6 or higher).

### Local setup

> The setup given here is for a linux environment (Debian/Ubuntu).

* Clone to local machine.

``` bash
$ git clone https://github.com/odysseusmax/animated-lamp.git
$ cd animated-lamp
````

* Create and activate virtual environment.

```
$ python3 -m venv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
```

* Install dependencies.

```
$ pip3 install -U -r requirements.txt
```

### Environment Variables

Properly setup the environment variables or populate `config.py` with the values. Setting up environment variables is advised as some of the values are sensitive data, and should be kept secret.

* `API_ID`(required) - Get your telegram API_ID from [https://my.telegram.org/](https://my.telegram.org/).
* `API_HASH`(required) - Get your telegram API_HASH from [https://my.telegram.org/](https://my.telegram.org/).
* `BOT_TOKEN`(required) - Obtain your bot token from [Bot Father](https://t.me/BotFather ""Bot Father"").
* `LOG_CHANNEL`(required) - Log channel's id.
* `DATABASE_URL`(required) - Mongodb database URI.
* `AUTH_USERS`(required) - Admin(s) of the bot. User's telegram id separated by space. Atleast one id should be specified.
* `HOST`(required) - Public URL of file streaming service ([See Setting up Streaming Service](#setting-up-streaming-service)).
* `SESSION_NAME`(optional) - Name you want to call your bot's session, Eg: bot's username.
* `MAX_PROCESSES_PER_USER`(optional) - Number of parallel processes each user can have, defaults to 2.
* `MAX_TRIM_DURATION`(optional) - Maximum allowed video trim duration in seconds. Defaults to 600s.
* `TRACK_CHANNEL`(optional) - User activity tracking channel's id. Only needed if you want to track and block any user. Disabled by default.
* `SLOW_SPEED_DELAY`(optional) - Delay required between each interaction from users in seconds. Defaults to 5s.
* `TIMEOUT` (optional) - Maximum time alloted to each process in seconds, after which process will be cancelled. Defaults to 1800s(30 mins).
* `DEBUG` (optional) - Set some value to use DEBUG logging level. INFO by default.
* `IAM_HEADER` (optional) - Authentication token for streaming service. Defaults to `''`.
* `WORKER_COUNT` (optional) - Number of process to be handled at a time. Defaults to `20`.

### Run bot

`$ python3 -m bot`

Now go and `/start` the bot. If everything went right, bot will respond with welcome message.

## Setting up Streaming Service

The streaming service can be a custom version of [TgFileStream](https://github.com/tulir/tgfilestream), modded to work with this setup. The mod basicaly is adding a type of header based authentication and changing the endpoints. The authentication part is optional and the endpoint used here is `/file/:chat_id/:message_id`. Make sure to note these changes when deploying your own instance. The streaming service used for [@screenshotit_bot](https://tx.me/screenshotit_bot ""Screenshot Generator Bot"") is not related to [TgFileStream](https://github.com/tulir/tgfilestream) and I do not plan to make it OSS.

## Supported commands and functions

### Commands

245,245,reminder-bot/bot,Python,"# Reminder Bot

## A bot for doing reminders

### Installing

#### Deps:

* MySQL 8+
* Python 3.8+
* pymysql, discord.py>=1.3.0a, pytz, dateparser, sqlalchemy, tinyconf, aiohttp
* libmysqlclient21 and libmysqlclient-dev
* Rust 1.42 with Cargo (for compilation only)

#### Optional Deps:

* Mypy (for static type checking if modifying code)

#### Running:

* Ensure the languages folder has your desired language files (a `git submodule init` should get all of them from the official repo, or check https://github.com/reminder-bot/languages for specifics)
* Log into MySQL and execute

```SQL
CREATE DATABASE reminders;
```

* Create file `config.ini` in the same location as `main.py`
* Fill it with the following stub:

```ini
[DEFAULT]
token =
dbl_token =
patreon_enabled = no
patreon_server =
patreon_role =
strings_location = ./languages/
local_timezone = UTC
local_language = EN
ignore_bots = 1

[SHARDS]
min_shard = 0
max_shard = 0
shard_count = 1

[MYSQL]
user = 
;passwd =
host = localhost
database = reminders
```

* Insert values into `token` and `user` for your MySQL setup and your bot's authorization token (can be found at https://discordapp.com/developers/applications)
* Set `local_timezone` to a time region that is representative of your local time. For example, for the UK this is *Europe/London*
* `python3 main.py` to test all that's okay

* Clone down the postman (https://github.com/reminder-bot/postman-rs)
* Move to the directory and perform `cargo build --release` to compile it
* Create a file `.env` and fill with the following:

```
DISCORD_TOKEN=""auth token as above""
DATABASE_URL=""mysql://user:passwd@localhost/reminders""
INTERVAL=15
```
N: You can change `INTERVAL` to be higher for less CPU usage or lower for reminders that are more on time. Any value less than 15 is fairly excessive; the live bot uses 5. Interval is the number of seconds between checking for reminders.

N: **ON OLDER VERSIONS ONLY** Modifying the `THREADS` value is NOT recommended. This increases the amount of threads used for sending reminders. If you're sending many reminders in a single interval, increase this value. The live bot uses 1. New versions only run on one thread with asynchronous capability provided by Tokio and Reqwest

* Run the release binary in `./target/release` alongside the python file.

### Info

This is a simple hobby project which I was really curious about to implement. This is a Telegram bot which uses [Youtube Data API v3](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/ ""Youtube Data API v3"") to upload videos to Youtube.

### Libraries Used

- [Pyrogram](https://github.com/pyrogram/pyrogram ""Pyrogram"")
- [Google Client API](https://github.com/googleapis/google-api-python-client ""Google Client API"")

### Setup

:heavy_exclamation_mark: This project requires Python3.6 or higher

**Clone and setup virtual environment**

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/odysseusmax/utube.git

$ cd utube

$ python3 -m venv venv

$ source venv/bin/activate

```

**Environment Variables**

- `BOT_TOKEN`(Required) - Get your bot token from [Bot Father](https://tx.me/BotFather ""Bot Father"").
- `SESSION_NAME`(optional) - Your bot's username.
- `API_ID`(Required) - Your telegram api id, get from [Manage Apps](https://my.telegram.org).
- `API_HASH`(Required) - Your telegram api hash, get from [Manage Apps](https://my.telegram.org).
- `CLIENT_ID`(Required) - Your google client id.
- `CLIENT_SECRET`(Required) - Your google client secret.
- `BOT_OWNER`(Required) - Telegram id of bot owner.
- `AUTH_USERS`(optional) - Telegram id's of authorised users, separated by `,`.
- `VIDEO_DESCRIPTION`(optional) - Any default description to be aded to the video.
- `VIDEO_CATEGORY`(optional) - YouTube's video category id. If not specified or specified id is invalid, category id will be selected randomly.
- `VIDEO_TITLE_PREFIX`(optional) - Any prefix to be added to the video's title.
- `VIDEO_TITLE_SUFFIX`(optional) - Any suffix to be added to the video's title.
- `UPLOAD_MODE`(optional) - The video's privacy status. Valid values for this property are: `private`, `public`, `unlisted`.
- `DEBUG` (optional) - Whether to set logging level to DEBUG. If set logging will be set to DEBUG level, else INFO level.

**Getting your `CLIENT_ID` and `CLIENT_SECRET`**

- Head to [Google console](https://console.developers.google.com ""Google console""), create a new project named `Youtube Uploader` and enable `API'S AND SERVISES`. Search for `YOUTUBE DATA API v3` and enable the API. Go to [Credentials](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials ""Credentials"") page, select your project `Youtube Uploader` create a new credential with `desktop` as type. Copy the `CLIENT_ID` and `CLIENT_SECRET`.
- You have to verify your application with google, only then you can make the uploaded videos public. YouTube changed its developer policy, and videos uploaded using unverfied applications will be kept private.

**Install requirements**

Run :

```bash
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

**Run bot**

Lets run our bot for the first time!

```bash
$ python3 -m bot
```

If you did everything correctly, the bot should be running. Go do `/start` to see if the bot is live or not. Follow the instructions provided by bot to setup authorisation and to start uploading.

**Or the easy way of directly deploying to heroku**

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy)

### Development Status

This project is actively maintained and will continue so until I'm tired of it.

### Special notes

- With the Youtube Data API you are awarded with 10,000 points of requests. For one video upload it costs 1605 points, regardless of file size, which calculates to about 6 uploads daily. Once you have exhausted your daily points, you have to wait till daily reset. Resets happens at 0:00 PST, i.e. 12:30 IST. So make your uploads count.

- Uploading copyright contents will leads to immediate blocking of the video.

- By default, all the videos are uploaded as private with random category id unless you provide `UPLOAD_MODE` and `VIDEO_CATEGORY`. You may change it after youtube processes the video.

(Currently) 🤖 A Telegram Bot that can control your Aria2 server, control server files and also upload to OneDrive / Google Drive.

## 【NOTE】
Since the author I need to prepare for my graduate exams at the moment, the development progress will be appropriately stalled, but I think the idea of this program is very good, so I will keep developing.
Questions or suggestions are very welcome, and although I can't focus on development on my end, I still log in to GitHub often to check out everyone's suggestions and pr.😀

## Project significance
> The following is only a vision of what this program will look like when it is completed, the functions described so far are not fully implemented, please refer to the following [Functions realized](#functions-realized) for details of implementation

This project is mainly to use small hard disk server for offline downloading, for large BitTorrent files to be downloaded in sections according to the size of the hard disk, each time downloading a part, then uploading the network disk, delete and then download the other parts, until all the files are downloaded.

At the same time, communication via the bot protocol facilitates use on machines that cannot intranet penetration, and simplifies the usual use of download programs for added convenience.For links, sending a message directly to the Bot will directly identify and download them. It can actually delete files from the download folder, which is not possible with web panels such as AriaNG, and is very convenient as a tool for managing downloads and notifying timely completion of downloads. You can move files, and for users who mount their hard drives via rclone you can copy and paste directly through this program, without having to open an ssh connection to the VPS for `cp` operations, which is also very convenient.


## Functions realized

}
```
#### Corresponding explanations
* aria2-server : Aria2 server address. Websocket connection is used by default. If you want to use websocket to connect to aria2, be sure to set `enable-rpc=true` in `aria2.conf`. If not necessary, please try to **set the local aria2 address**, in order to maximize the use of this program
* aria2-key : The value of `rpc-secret` in `aria2.conf`
* bot-key : ID of telegram Bot, get it by using [@BotFather](https://telegram.me/botfather)
* user-id : The ID of the administrator. It supports setting multiple users as administrators. Different users are separated by commas `,` . If you want to set the users whose `user-id` are 123465789, 987654321 and 963852741 as administrators, you need to set them as follows:
  ```jsonc
  {
    //···
    ""user-id"": ""123456789,987654321,963852741"",
    //···
  }
  ```
* max-index：Maximum display quantity of download information, 10 pieces are recommended (to be improved in the future)
* sign: Identification of this Bot, If multiple servers are required to connect to the same Bot, the specific server can be determined through this item.
* language: Language of Bot output
* downloadFolder: Aria2 download file save address.If you do not use this parameter, enter `""""`
* moveFolder： The folder to which you want to move the files for the `downloadFolder`. If you do not use this parameter, enter `""""`

#### Currently supported languages and language tags
| Languages           | Tag   |
|---------------------|-------|
| English             | en    |
| Simplified Chinese  | zh-CN |
| Traditional Chinese | zh-TW |

When you fill in the above language tag in `config.json`, the program will automatically download the language pack

#### About user-id
If you don't know your `user-id`, you can leave this field blank and enter `/myid` after running the Bot, and the Bot will return your `user-id`

## Invite
If you'd like to add **GiveawayBot** to your server, use the following link:<br>
🔗 **https://giveawaybot.party/invite**

## Usage
* **!ghelp** - Provides the bot's commands via Direct Message
* **!gcreate** - Interactive giveaway setup
* **!gstart \<time> [winners] [prize]** - Starts a new giveaway in the current channel. Users can react with a 🎉 to enter the giveaway. The time can be in seconds, minutes, hours, or days. Specify the time unit with an ""s"", ""m"", ""h"", or ""d"", for example `30s` or `2h`. If you include a number of winners, it must be in the form #w, for example `2w` or `5w`.
* **!greroll [messsageId]** - Re-rolls a winner. If you provided a message ID, it rerolls the giveaway at that ID. If you leave it blank, it looks in the current channel for the most recent giveaway and rerolls from that.
* **!gend [messageId]** - Ends a giveaway immediately. If you provided a message ID it will end the giveaway at that ID. If you leave it blank, it looks in the current channel for the most recent giveaway and ends that.
* **!glist** - Lists currently-running giveaways on the server.

### [What's new with Bot Framework](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/what-is-new?view=azure-bot-service-4.0)

This repository contains code for the Python version of the [Microsoft Bot Framework SDK](https://github.com/Microsoft/botframework-sdk), which is part of the Microsoft Bot Framework - a comprehensive framework for building enterprise-grade conversational AI experiences.

This SDK enables developers to model conversation and build sophisticated bot applications using Python. SDKs for [JavaScript](https://github.com/Microsoft/botbuilder-js), [.NET](https://github.com/Microsoft/botbuilder-dotnet) and [Java (preview)](https://github.com/Microsoft/botbuilder-java) are also available.

To get started building bots using the SDK, see the [Azure Bot Service Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/?view=azure-bot-service-4.0).

## Getting Started
To get started building bots using the SDK, see the [Azure Bot Service Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/?view=azure-bot-service-4.0).

The [Bot Framework Samples](https://github.com/microsoft/botbuilder-samples) includes a rich set of samples repository.

If you want to debug an issue, would like to [contribute](#contributing-code), or understand how the Bot Builder SDK works, instructions for building and testing the SDK are below.

### Prerequisites
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [Python 3.8.2](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

Python ""Virtual Environments"" allow Python packages to be installed in an isolated location for a particular application, rather than being installed globally, as such it is common practice to use them. Click [here](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/installing-packages/#creating-virtual-environments) to learn more about creating _and activating_ Virtual Environments in Python.

### Clone
Clone a copy of the repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/botbuilder-python.git
```
Change to the SDK's directory:
```bash
cd botbuilder-python
```

### Using the SDK locally

To use a local copy of the SDK you can link to these packages with the pip -e option.

```bash
pip install -e ./libraries/botbuilder-schema
pip install -e ./libraries/botframework-connector
pip install -e ./libraries/botframework-streaming
pip install -e ./libraries/botbuilder-core
pip install -e ./libraries/botbuilder-ai
pip install -e ./libraries/botbuilder-applicationinsights
pip install -e ./libraries/botbuilder-dialogs
pip install -e ./libraries/botbuilder-azure
pip install -e ./libraries/botbuilder-integration-applicationinsights-aiohttp
pip install -e ./libraries/botbuilder-adapters-slack
pip install -e ./libraries/botbuilder-integration-aiohttp
pip install -e ./libraries/botbuilder-testing
```

### Running unit tests
First execute the following command from the root level of the repo:
```bash
pip install -r ./libraries/botframework-connector/tests/requirements.txt
pip install -r ./libraries/botbuilder-core/tests/requirements.txt
pip install -r ./libraries/botbuilder-ai/tests/requirements.txt
```

Then enter run pytest by simply typing it into your CLI:

```bash
pytest
```

This is the expected output:
```bash
============================= test session starts =============================
platform win32 -- Python 3.8.2, pytest-3.4.0, py-1.5.2, pluggy-0.6.0
rootdir: C:\projects\botbuilder-python, inifile:
plugins: cov-2.5.1
...
```

## Design Credits

All design and inspiration credits belong to [Alejandro Ausejo](https://dribbble.com/shots/6251784-Navigation-Menu-Animation).

## Usage

-   Create menu.xml under your res/menu/ folder
```xml
<?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""utf-8""?>
<menu xmlns:android=""http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"">

    <item
        android:id=""@+id/item0""
        android:title=""@string/menu_dashboard""
        android:icon=""@drawable/ic_dashboard_white_24dp""/>

    <item
        android:id=""@+id/item1""
        android:title=""@string/menu_leaderboard""
        android:icon=""@drawable/ic_multiline_chart_white_24dp""/>

    <item
        android:id=""@+id/item2""
        android:title=""@string/menu_store""
        android:icon=""@drawable/ic_store_white_24dp""/>

    <item
        android:id=""@+id/item3""
        android:title=""@string/menu_profile""
        android:icon=""@drawable/ic_person_outline_white_24dp""/>

</menu>
```

-   Add view into your layout file
```xml
<me.ibrahimsn.lib.SmoothBottomBar
    android:id=""@+id/bottomBar""
    android:layout_width=""match_parent""
    android:layout_height=""70dp""
    app:backgroundColor=""@color/colorPrimary""
    app:menu=""@menu/menu_bottom""/>
```

-   Use SmoothBottomBar callbacks in your activity
```kotlin
bottomBar.onItemSelected = {
    status.text = ""Item $it selected""
}

bottomBar.onItemReselected = {
    status.text = ""Item $it re-selected""
}
```

OR

```kotlin
bottomBar.setOnItemSelectedListener(object: OnItemSelectedListener {
    override fun onItemSelect(pos: Int) {
        status.text = ""Item $pos selected""
    }
})

bottomBar.setOnItemReselectedListener(object: OnItemReselectedListener {
    override fun onItemReselect(pos: Int) {
        status.text = ""Item $pos re-selected""
    }
})
```

 >**Note:** For projects without kotlin, you may need to add `org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-stdlib:$kotlinVersion` to your dependencies since this is a Kotlin library.

## **Use SmoothBottomBar with [Navigation Components](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation/).**

Coupled with the Navigation Component from the [Android Jetpack](https://developer.android.com/jetpack), SmoothBottomBar offers easier navigation within your application by designating navigation to the Navigation Component. This works best when using fragments, as the Navigation component helps to handle your fragment transactions.

- Setup Navigation Component i.e. Add dependenccy to your project, create a Navigation Graph etc.
- For each Fragment in your Navigation Graph, ensure that the Fragment's `id` is the same as the MenuItems in your Menu i.e res/menu/ folder
```xml
<?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""utf-8""?>
<menu xmlns:android=""http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"">

    <item
        android:id=""@+id/first_fragment""
        android:title=""@string/menu_dashboard""
        android:icon=""@drawable/ic_dashboard_white_24dp""/>

    <item
        android:id=""@+id/second_fragment""
        android:title=""@string/menu_leaderboard""
        android:icon=""@drawable/ic_multiline_chart_white_24dp""/>

    <item
        android:id=""@+id/third_fragment""
        android:title=""@string/menu_store""
        android:icon=""@drawable/ic_store_white_24dp""/>

    <item
        android:id=""@+id/fourth_fragment""
        android:title=""@string/menu_profile""
        android:icon=""@drawable/ic_person_outline_white_24dp""/>

</menu>
```

Navigation Graph i.e res/navigation/ folder
```xml
<?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""utf-8""?>
<navigation xmlns:android=""http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android""
    xmlns:app=""http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto""
    xmlns:tools=""http://schemas.android.com/tools""
    android:id=""@+id/nav_graph""
    app:startDestination=""@id/first_fragment"">

    <fragment
        android:id=""@+id/first_fragment""
        android:name=""me.ibrahimsn.smoothbottombar.FirstFragment""
        android:label=""Dashboard""
        tools:layout=""@layout/fragment_first"" >
        <action
            android:id=""@+id/action_firstFragment_to_secondFragment""
            app:destination=""@id/second_fragment"" />
    </fragment>
    <fragment
        android:id=""@+id/second_fragment""
        android:name=""me.ibrahimsn.smoothbottombar.SecondFragment""
        android:label=""Leaderboard""
        tools:layout=""@layout/fragment_second"" >
        <action
            android:id=""@+id/action_secondFragment_to_thirdFragment""
            app:destination=""@id/third_fragment"" />
    </fragment>
    <fragment
        android:id=""@+id/third_fragment""
        android:name=""me.ibrahimsn.smoothbottombar.ThirdFragment""
        android:label=""Store""
        tools:layout=""@layout/fragment_third"" >
        <action
            android:id=""@+id/action_thirdFragment_to_fourthFragment""
            app:destination=""@id/fourth_fragment"" />
    </fragment>
    <fragment
        android:id=""@+id/fourth_fragment""
        android:name=""me.ibrahimsn.smoothbottombar.FourthFragment""
        android:label=""Profile""
        tools:layout=""@layout/fragment_fourth"" />
</navigation>
```

- In your activity i.e `MainActivity`, create an instance of `PopupMenu` which takes a `context` and an `anchor`(pass in null) and then inflate this `PopupMenu` with the layout menu for the `SmoothBottomBar`.  
- Get a reference to your `SmoothBottomBar` and call `setupWithNavController()` which takes in a `Menu` and `NavController`, pass in the menu of the previously instantiated `PopupMenu` i.e.(`popUpMenu.menu`)  and your `NavController`. 
- Preferably set this up in a function as shown below and call this function i.e. (`setupSmoothBottomMenu()`) in the `onCreate` method of your activity. 

**N.B:**  Sample app makes use of [ViewBinding](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/view-binding) to get reference to views in the layout.

```kotlin
   private fun setupSmoothBottomMenu() {
        val popupMenu = PopupMenu(this, null)
        popupMenu.inflate(R.menu.menu_bottom)
        val menu = popupMenu.menu
        binding.bottomBar.setupWithNavController(menu, navController)
    }
```

### ActionBar
You can also setup your `ActionBar` with the Navigation Component by calling `setupActionBarWithNavController` and pass in your `NavController`. 

**N.B:** Your app needs to have a `Toolbar` for `setupActionBarWithNavController` to work. If your app theme doesn't have a `Toolbar` i.e. (Theme.AppCompat.Light.NoActionBar) you would need to: 

- Add one to your layout i.e.

```xml
 <com.google.android.material.appbar.AppBarLayout
        android:id=""@+id/app_bar_layout""
        android:layout_width=""match_parent""
        android:layout_height=""wrap_content""
        app:layout_constraintEnd_toEndOf=""parent""
        app:layout_constraintStart_toStartOf=""parent""
        app:layout_constraintTop_toTopOf=""parent"">
        <androidx.appcompat.widget.Toolbar
            android:id=""@+id/toolBar""
            android:layout_width=""match_parent""
            android:layout_height=""wrap_content"" />
    </com.google.android.material.appbar.AppBarLayout>
```
- Set the support action bar to your `Toolbar` using `setSupportActionBar(your_toolbar_id)` in this case `setSupportActionBar(binding.toolBar)`

We now have something like this:

```kotlin
 private lateinit var navController: NavController
 private lateinit var binding: ActivityMainBinding

    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
        binding = ActivityMainBinding.inflate(layoutInflater)
        setContentView(binding.root)
        navController = findNavController(R.id.main_fragment)
        setupActionBarWithNavController(navController)
        setupSmoothBottomMenu()
    }
    
    private fun setupSmoothBottomMenu() {
        val popupMenu = PopupMenu(this, null)
        popupMenu.inflate(R.menu.menu_bottom)
        val menu = popupMenu.menu
        binding.bottomBar.setupWithNavController(menu, navController)
    }

    override fun onSupportNavigateUp(): Boolean {
        return navController.navigateUp() || super.onSupportNavigateUp()
    }

### Update [8th May, 2021]
Prior to the [initial addition of this feature](https://github.com/ibrahimsn98/SmoothBottomBar/pull/33), you can now inflate separate menu items for the `SmoothBottomBar` and your `Toolbar`. 
- Create the menu item you want to inflate in the `Toolbar` i.e.

```xml
<?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""utf-8""?>
<menu xmlns:android=""http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"">
    <item
        android:id=""@+id/another_item_1""
        android:title=""Another Item 1"" />
    <item
        android:id=""@+id/another_item_2""
        android:title=""Another Item 2"" />
    <item
        android:id=""@+id/another_item_3""
        android:title=""Another Item 3"" />
</menu>
```
- Override `OnCreateOptionsMenu` and `onOptionsItemSelected` (ensure it returns `super.onOptionsItemSelected(item)`). Now we have:

```kotlin
  class MainActivity : AppCompatActivity() {
    private lateinit var navController: NavController
    private lateinit var binding: ActivityMainBinding

    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
        binding = ActivityMainBinding.inflate(layoutInflater)
        setContentView(binding.root)
        navController = findNavController(R.id.main_fragment)
        setupActionBarWithNavController(navController)
        setupSmoothBottomMenu()
    }

    override fun onCreateOptionsMenu(menu: Menu?): Boolean {
        menuInflater.inflate(R.menu.another_menu, menu)
        return true
    }

    override fun onOptionsItemSelected(item: MenuItem): Boolean {
        when (item.itemId) {
            R.id.another_item_1 -> {
                showToast(""Another Menu Item 1 Selected"")
            }

            R.id.another_item_2 -> {
                showToast(""Another Menu Item 2 Selected"")
            }

            R.id.another_item_3 -> {
                showToast(""Another Menu Item 3 Selected"")
            }
        }
        return super.onOptionsItemSelected(item)
    }


    private fun showToast(msg: String) {
        Toast.makeText(this, msg, Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show()
    }

    private fun setupSmoothBottomMenu() {
        val popupMenu = PopupMenu(this, null)
        popupMenu.inflate(R.menu.menu_bottom)
        val menu = popupMenu.menu
        binding.bottomBar.setupWithNavController(menu, navController)
    }

    override fun onSupportNavigateUp(): Boolean {
        return navController.navigateUp() || super.onSupportNavigateUp()
    }
}
```

[![StyleCI](https://styleci.io/repos/38492095/shield?branch=master)](https://styleci.io/repos/38492095)

A very simple PHP [Telegram Bot API](https://core.telegram.org/bots).    
Compliant with the November 17, 2017 Telegram Bot API update.

Requirements
---------

* PHP >= 5.3
* Curl extension for PHP5 must be enabled.
* Telegram API key, you can get one simply with [@BotFather](https://core.telegram.org/bots#botfather) with simple commands right after creating your bot.

For the WebHook:
* An VALID SSL certificate (Telegram API requires this). You can use [Cloudflare's Free Flexible SSL](https://www.cloudflare.com/ssl) which crypts the web traffic from end user to their proxies if you're using CloudFlare DNS.    
Since the August 29 update you can use a self-signed ssl certificate.

For the getUpdates(Long Polling):
* Some way to execute the script in order to serve messages (for example cronjob)

Download
---------

#### Using Composer

From your project directory, run:
```
composer require eleirbag89/telegrambotphp
```
or
```
php composer.phar require eleirbag89/telegrambotphp
```
Note: If you don't have Composer you can download it [HERE](https://getcomposer.org/download/).

#### Using release archives

https://github.com/Eleirbag89/TelegramBotPHP/releases

#### Using Git

From a project directory, run:
```
git clone https://github.com/Eleirbag89/TelegramBotPHP.git
```

Installation
---------

#### Via Composer's autoloader

After downloading by using Composer, you can include Composer's autoloader:
```php
include (__DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php');

$telegram = new Telegram('YOUR TELEGRAM TOKEN HERE');
```

#### Via TelegramBotPHP class

Copy Telegram.php into your server and include it in your new bot script:
```php
include 'Telegram.php';

$telegram = new Telegram('YOUR TELEGRAM TOKEN HERE');
```

Note: To enable error log file, also copy TelegramErrorLogger.php in the same directory of Telegram.php file.

Configuration (WebHook)
---------

Navigate to 
https://api.telegram.org/bot(BOT_TOKEN)/setWebhook?url=https://yoursite.com/your_update.php
Or use the Telegram class setWebhook method.

Examples
---------

```php
$telegram = new Telegram('YOUR TELEGRAM TOKEN HERE');

$chat_id = $telegram->ChatID();
$content = array('chat_id' => $chat_id, 'text' => 'Test');
$telegram->sendMessage($content);
```

If you want to get some specific parameter from the Telegram response:
```php
$telegram = new Telegram('YOUR TELEGRAM TOKEN HERE');

$result = $telegram->getData();
$text = $result['message'] ['text'];
$chat_id = $result['message'] ['chat']['id'];
$content = array('chat_id' => $chat_id, 'text' => 'Test');
$telegram->sendMessage($content);
```

To upload a Photo or some other files, you need to load it with CurlFile:
```php
// Load a local file to upload. If is already on Telegram's Servers just pass the resource id
$img = curl_file_create('test.png','image/png'); 
$content = array('chat_id' => $chat_id, 'photo' => $img );
$telegram->sendPhoto($content);
```

To download a file on the Telegram's servers
```php
$file = $telegram->getFile($file_id);
$telegram->downloadFile($file['result']['file_path'], './my_downloaded_file_on_local_server.png');
```

See update.php or update cowsay.php for the complete example.
If you wanna see the CowSay Bot in action [add it](https://telegram.me/cowmooobot).

If you want to use getUpdates instead of the WebHook you need to call the the `serveUpdate` function inside a for cycle.
```php
$telegram = new Telegram('YOUR TELEGRAM TOKEN HERE');

$req = $telegram->getUpdates();

for ($i = 0; $i < $telegram-> UpdateCount(); $i++) {
	// You NEED to call serveUpdate before accessing the values of message in Telegram Class
	$telegram->serveUpdate($i);
	$text = $telegram->Text();
	$chat_id = $telegram->ChatID();

	if ($text == '/start') {
		$reply = 'Working';
		$content = array('chat_id' => $chat_id, 'text' => $reply);
		$telegram->sendMessage($content);
	}
	// DO OTHER STUFF
}
```
See getUpdates.php for the complete example.

Functions
------------

Build keyboards
------------

Telegram's bots can have two different kind of keyboards: Inline and Reply.    
The InlineKeyboard is linked to a particular message, while the ReplyKeyboard is linked to the whole chat.    
They are both an array of array of buttons, which rapresent the rows and columns.    
For instance you can arrange a ReplyKeyboard like this:
![ReplyKeabordExample](https://picload.org/image/rilclcwr/replykeyboard.png)
using this code:
```php
$option = array( 
    //First row
    array($telegram->buildKeyboardButton(""Button 1""), $telegram->buildKeyboardButton(""Button 2"")), 
    //Second row 
    array($telegram->buildKeyboardButton(""Button 3""), $telegram->buildKeyboardButton(""Button 4""), $telegram->buildKeyboardButton(""Button 5"")), 
    //Third row
    array($telegram->buildKeyboardButton(""Button 6"")) );
$keyb = $telegram->buildKeyBoard($option, $onetime=false);
$content = array('chat_id' => $chat_id, 'reply_markup' => $keyb, 'text' => ""This is a Keyboard Test"");
$telegram->sendMessage($content);
```
When a user click on the button, the button text is send back to the bot.    
For an InlineKeyboard it's pretty much the same (but you need to provide a valid URL or a Callback data)
![InlineKeabordExample](https://picload.org/image/rilclcwa/replykeyboardinline.png)
```php
$option = array( 
    //First row
    array($telegram->buildInlineKeyBoardButton(""Button 1"", $url=""http://link1.com""), $telegram->buildInlineKeyBoardButton(""Button 2"", $url=""http://link2.com"")), 
    //Second row 
    array($telegram->buildInlineKeyBoardButton(""Button 3"", $url=""http://link3.com""), $telegram->buildInlineKeyBoardButton(""Button 4"", $url=""http://link4.com""), $telegram->buildInlineKeyBoardButton(""Button 5"", $url=""http://link5.com"")), 
    //Third row
    array($telegram->buildInlineKeyBoardButton(""Button 6"", $url=""http://link6.com"")) );
$keyb = $telegram->buildInlineKeyBoard($option);
$content = array('chat_id' => $chat_id, 'reply_markup' => $keyb, 'text' => ""This is a Keyboard Test"");
$telegram->sendMessage($content);
```
This is the list of all the helper functions to make keyboards easily:     

```php
buildKeyBoard(array $options, $onetime=true, $resize=true, $selective=true)
```
Send a custom keyboard. $option is an array of array KeyboardButton.  
Check [ReplyKeyBoardMarkUp](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#replykeyboardmarkup) for more info.    

```php

```
Send a custom keyboard. $inline_keyboard is an array of array InlineKeyboardButton.  
Check [InlineKeyboardMarkup](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#inlinekeyboardmarkup) for more info.

## Retrieving the BOTS v1 Dataset
The dataset is available in several formats:
### Splunk Indexed

This is recommended way to explore and analyze the BOTS dataset.

Download the dataset from this location: [botsv1_data_set.tgz](https://s3.amazonaws.com/botsdataset/botsv1/splunk-pre-indexed/botsv1_data_set.tgz) (6.1GB compressed)

Alternatively, this collection represents a much smaller version of the original dataset containing only attack data. In other words, ""just the needles, no haystack."" [botsv1-attack-only.tgz](https://s3.amazonaws.com/botsdataset/botsv1/botsv1-attack-only.tgz)(135MB compressed)

The dataset requires the following software which is distributed and licensed separately
and should be installed before using the dataset. The versions listed are
those that were used to create the dataset. Different versions of the software
may or may not work properly. If you are new to Splunk, follow [these instructions](http://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/7.0.0/Installation/Whatsinthismanual) to install the free Splunk Enterprise trial and [these instructions](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/AddOns/released/Overview/Singleserverinstall) to install apps and add-ons.

CloudBot is a simple, fast, expandable open-source Python IRC Bot!

## Project Status & A more updated CloudBot

CloudBot is currently unmaintained. The project possibly usable, but there are currently no developers building new features or fixing bugs.

There are several forks of CloudBot which you may want to use instead. These projects have much more work done on them, and are thus incompatible. If you already have a running CloudBot instance you will probably need to start over from
scratch.

- snoonetIRC/CloudBot : https://github.com/snoonetIRC/CloudBot

  This is a more active fork being created by members of Snoonet that might be a better option for your needs. Keep in mind that, as a project more than a thousand commits ahead of this one, if you already have a running CloudBot instance you will probably need to start over from scratch.

- gonzobot : https://github.com/edwardslabs/CloudBot

If there are any other maintained forks of CloudBot, pull requests to add them to the README are welcome.

## Getting CloudBot

There are currently two different branches of this repository, each with a different level of stability:
 - **master** *(stable)*: This branch contains stable, tested code. This is the branch you should be using if you just want to run your own CloudBot! [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/CloudBotIRC/CloudBot.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/CloudBotIRC/CloudBot)
 - **python3.4** *(unstable)*: This branch is where we test and develop new features. If you would like to help develop CloudBot, you can use this branch. [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/CloudBotIRC/CloudBot.svg?branch=python3.4)](https://travis-ci.org/CloudBotIRC/CloudBot)
 
New releases will be pushed from **python3.4** to **master** whenever we have a stable version to release. This should happen on a fairly regular basis, so you'll never be too far behind the latest improvements.

## Installing CloudBot

Firstly, CloudBot will only run on **Python 3.4 or higher**. Because we use the asyncio module, you will not be able to use any other versions of Python.

To install CloudBot on *nix (linux, etc), see [here](https://github.com/CloudBotIRC/CloudBot/wiki/Installing-on-*nix)

To install CloudBot on Windows, see [here](https://github.com/CloudBotIRC/CloudBot/wiki/Installing-on-Windows)


### Running CloudBot

Before you run the bot, rename `config.default.json` to `config.json` and edit it with your preferred settings. You can check if your JSON is valid using [jsonlint.com](http://jsonlint.com/)!

Once you have installed the required dependencies and renamed the config file, you can run the bot! Make sure you are in the correct folder and run the following command:

```
python3.4 -m cloudbot
```

Note that you can also run the `cloudbot/__main__.py` file directly, which will work from any directory.
```
python3.4 CloudBot/cloudbot/__main__.py
```
Specify the path as /path/to/repository/cloudbot/__main__.py, where `cloudbot` is inside the repository directory.

258,258,pskrunner14/trading-bot,Jupyter Notebook,"# Overview

This project implements a Stock Trading Bot, trained using Deep Reinforcement Learning, specifically Deep Q-learning. Implementation is kept simple and as close as possible to the algorithm discussed in the paper, for learning purposes.

## Introduction

Generally, Reinforcement Learning is a family of machine learning techniques that allow us to create intelligent agents that learn from the environment by interacting with it, as they learn an optimal policy by trial and error. This is especially useful in many real world tasks where supervised learning might not be the best approach due to various reasons like nature of task itself, lack of appropriate labelled data, etc.

The important idea here is that this technique can be applied to any real world task that can be described loosely as a Markovian process.

## Approach

This work uses a Model-free Reinforcement Learning technique called Deep Q-Learning (neural variant of Q-Learning).
At any given time (episode), an agent abserves it's current state (n-day window stock price representation), selects and performs an action (buy/sell/hold), observes a subsequent state, receives some reward signal (difference in portfolio position) and lastly adjusts it's parameters based on the gradient of the loss computed.

There have been several improvements to the Q-learning algorithm over the years, and a few have been implemented in this project:

- [x] Vanilla DQN
- [x] DQN with fixed target distribution
- [x] Double DQN
- [ ] Prioritized Experience Replay
- [ ] Dueling Network Architectures

## Results

Trained on `GOOG` 2010-17 stock data, tested on 2019 with a profit of $1141.45 (validated on 2018 with profit of $863.41):

![Google Stock Trading episode](./extra/visualization.png)

You can obtain similar visualizations of your model evaluations using the [notebook](./visualize.ipynb) provided.

## Some Caveats

- At any given state, the agent can only decide to buy/sell one stock at a time. This is done to keep things as simple as possible as the problem of deciding how much stock to buy/sell is one of portfolio redistribution.
- The n-day window feature representation is a vector of subsequent differences in Adjusted Closing price of the stock we're trading followed by a sigmoid operation, done in order to normalize the values to the range [0, 1].
- Training is prefferably done on CPU due to it's sequential manner, after each episode of trading we replay the experience (1 epoch over a small minibatch) and update model parameters.

## Data

You can download Historical Financial data from [Yahoo! Finance](https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/) for training, or even use some sample datasets already present under `data/`.

## Getting Started

In order to use this project, you'll need to install the required python packages:

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Now you can open up a terminal and start training the agent:

```bash
python3 train.py data/GOOG.csv data/GOOG_2018.csv --strategy t-dqn
```

Once you're done training, run the evaluation script and let the agent make trading decisions:

```bash
python3 eval.py data/GOOG_2019.csv --model-name model_GOOG_50 --debug
```

Now you are all set up!

265,265,joaoricardo000/whatsapp-bot-seed,Python,"# whatsapp-bot-seed
A small python seed to create a Whatsapp Bot, with regex-callback routes (just like a web framework).  
(practical extension of the examples on https://github.com/tgalal/yowsup)

# :warning: Warning :warning:
Unfortunately, after some updates in the whatsapp servers, bots are beeing banned real quickly. Some just last a couple hours.  
Whatsapp does not have an open protocol, so [yowsup](https://github.com/tgalal/yowsup/issues) -- the core implementation behind this seed -- relies on reverse engineering to understand the messages exchange. Right now [there is a lot of issues with this implementation](https://github.com/tgalal/yowsup/issues).  
This project had a good run, was really useful and bots prior to the server update could run for months without any trouble. Right now is very unstable and unreliable due the ban problem.  
If a new library/protocol update solves this issue, the work will return. Until then, sadly, the project will be on hold.

# What it does?
- Basic message handling:  
![Example](http://i.imgur.com/TbirVKg.jpg?1)  
  
  
  
- Automatic media (images and videos) download, and url print screens  
![Example](http://i.imgur.com/fItWbTR.jpg?1)  

  
  
- Youtube Video Downloads, and Text to Speech  
![Example](http://i.imgur.com/dMbWLCm.jpg?1)  

  
  
- Google image and web search  
![Example](http://i.imgur.com/gDYIEej.jpg?1)
  
  
- Group administration  
![Example](http://i.imgur.com/pSDCWDb.png?1)  
and a bit more...
  


# Installation
1. Install the image handling system dependencies on ```bash opt/system-requirements.sh```
2. Create a virtualenv and install the requirements  ```pip install -r opt/requirements.pip```
3. Follow the instructions on ```src/config.py``` to get the whatsapp credentials.  
4. Then just run the server with  ```python src/server.py```  

# Or with Docker!
$ git clone https://github.com/joaoricardo000/whatsapp-bot-seed/  
$ cd whatsapp-bot-seed  
*(Edit Dockerfile to include your credentials)*  
$ docker build -t whatsapp-bot .  
$ docker run -p 0.0.0.0:9005:9005 whatsapp-bot  

The server will be running. Access http://localhost:9005 (default: admin:password) for process controll and logs.

# Microsoft Bot Framework Direct Line JS Client

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Microsoft/BotFramework-DirectLineJS.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Microsoft/BotFramework-DirectLineJS)

Client library for the [Microsoft Bot Framework](http://www.botframework.com) *[Direct Line](https://docs.botframework.com/en-us/restapi/directline3/)* protocol.

Used by [WebChat](https://github.com/Microsoft/BotFramework-WebChat) and thus (by extension) [Emulator](https://github.com/Microsoft/BotFramework-Emulator), WebChat channel, and [Azure Bot Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/bot-service/).

## FAQ

### *Who is this for?*

Anyone who is building a Bot Framework JavaScript client who does not want to use [WebChat](https://github.com/Microsoft/BotFramework-WebChat).

If you're currently using WebChat, you don't need to make any changes as it includes this package.

### *What is that funny `subscribe()` method in the samples below?*

Instead of callbacks or Promises, this library handles async operations using Observables. Try it, you'll like it! For more information, check out [RxJS](https://github.com/reactivex/rxjs/).

### *Can I use [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.com)?*

You bet.

### How ready for prime time is this library?

This is an official Microsoft-supported library, and is considered largely complete. Future changes (aside from supporting future updates to the Direct Line protocol) will likely be limited to bug fixes, performance improvements, tutorials, and samples. The big missing piece here is unit tests.

That said, the public API is still subject to change.

## How to build from source

0. Clone this repo
1. `npm install`
2. `npm run build` (or `npm run watch` to rebuild on every change, or `npm run prepublishOnly` to build production)

## How to include in your app

There are several ways:

1. Build from scratch and include either `/directLine.js` (webpacked with rxjs) or `lib/directline.js` in your app
2. `npm install botframework-directlinejs`

## Using from within a Node environment

This library uses RxJs/AjaxObserverable which is meant for use in a DOM environment. That doesn't mean you can't also use it from Node though, you just need to do a couple of extra things:

1. `npm install --save ws xhr2`
2. Add the following towards the top of your main application file:

```typescript
global.XMLHttpRequest = require('xhr2');
global.WebSocket = require('ws');
```

## How to create and use a directLine object

### Obtain security credentials for your bot:

1. If you haven't already, [register your bot](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/bot-service/).
2. Add a DirectLine (**not WebChat**) channel, and generate a Direct Line Secret. Make sure Direct Line 3.0 is enabled.
3. For testing you can use your Direct Line Secret as a security token, but for production you will likely want to exchange that Secret for a Token as detailed in the Direct Line [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/bot-service-channel-directline?view=azure-bot-service-4.0).

### Create a DirectLine object:

```typescript
import { DirectLine } from 'botframework-directlinejs';
// For Node.js:
// const { DirectLine } = require('botframework-directlinejs');

var directLine = new DirectLine({
    secret: /* put your Direct Line secret here */,
    token: /* or put your Direct Line token here (supply secret OR token, not both) */,
    domain: /* optional: if you are not using the default Direct Line endpoint, e.g. if you are using a region-specific endpoint, put its full URL here */
    webSocket: /* optional: false if you want to use polling GET to receive messages. Defaults to true (use WebSocket). */,
    pollingInterval: /* optional: set polling interval in milliseconds. Defaults to 1000 */,
    timeout: /* optional: a timeout in milliseconds for requests to the bot. Defaults to 20000 */,
    conversationStartProperties: { /* optional: properties to send to the bot on conversation start */
        locale: 'en-US'
    }
});
```

### Post activities to the bot:

```typescript
directLine.postActivity({
    from: { id: 'myUserId', name: 'myUserName' }, // required (from.name is optional)
    type: 'message',
    text: 'a message for you, Rudy'
}).subscribe(
    id => console.log(""Posted activity, assigned ID "", id),
    error => console.log(""Error posting activity"", error)
);
```

You can also post messages with attachments, and non-message activities such as events, by supplying the appropriate fields in the activity.

### Listen to activities sent from the bot:

```typescript
directLine.activity$
.subscribe(
    activity => console.log(""received activity "", activity)
);
```

You can use RxJS operators on incoming activities. To see only message activities:

```typescript
directLine.activity$
.filter(activity => activity.type === 'message')
.subscribe(
    message => console.log(""received message "", message)
);
```

Direct Line will helpfully send your client a copy of every sent activity, so a common pattern is to filter incoming messages on `from`:

```typescript
directLine.activity$
.filter(activity => activity.type === 'message' && activity.from.id === 'yourBotHandle')
.subscribe(
    message => console.log(""received message "", message)
);
```

### Monitor connection status

Subscribing to either `postActivity` or `activity$` will start the process of connecting to the bot. Your app can listen to the connection status and react appropriately :

```typescript

import { ConnectionStatus } from 'botframework-directlinejs';

directLine.connectionStatus$
.subscribe(connectionStatus => {
    switch(connectionStatus) {
        case ConnectionStatus.Uninitialized:    // the status when the DirectLine object is first created/constructed
        case ConnectionStatus.Connecting:       // currently trying to connect to the conversation
        case ConnectionStatus.Online:           // successfully connected to the converstaion. Connection is healthy so far as we know.
        case ConnectionStatus.ExpiredToken:     // last operation errored out with an expired token. Your app should supply a new one.
        case ConnectionStatus.FailedToConnect:  // the initial attempt to connect to the conversation failed. No recovery possible.
        case ConnectionStatus.Ended:            // the bot ended the conversation
    }
});
```

### Reconnect to a conversation

If your app created your DirectLine object by passing a token, DirectLine will refresh that token every 15 minutes.
Should your client lose connectivity (e.g. close laptop, fail to pay Internet access bill, go under a tunnel), `connectionStatus$`
will change to `ConnectionStatus.ExpiredToken`. Your app can request a new token from its server, which should call
the [Reconnect](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/rest-api/bot-framework-rest-direct-line-3-0-reconnect-to-conversation?view=azure-bot-service-4.0) API.
The resultant Conversation object can then be passed by the app to DirectLine.

```typescript
var conversation = /* a Conversation object obtained from your app's server */;
directLine.reconnect(conversation);
```

### Resume an existing conversation

When using DirectLine with WebChat, closing the current tab or refreshing the page will create a new conversation in most cases. You can resume an existing conversation to keep the user in the same context.

**When using a secret** you can resume a conversation by:
- Storing the conversationid (in a *permanent* place, like local storage)
- Giving this value back while creating the DirectLine object along with the secret

```typescript
import { DirectLine } from 'botframework-directlinejs';

const dl = new DirectLine({
    secret: /* SECRET */,
    conversationId: /* the conversationid you stored from previous conversation */
});
```

**When using a token** you can resume a conversation by:
- Storing the conversationid and your token (in a *permanent* place, like local storage)
- Calling the DirectLine reconnect API yourself to get a refreshed token and a streamurl
- Creating the DirectLine object using the ConversationId, Token, and StreamUrl

```typescript
import { DirectLine } from 'botframework-directlinejs';

const dl = new DirectLine({
    token: /* the token you retrieved while reconnecting */,
    streamUrl: /* the streamUrl you retrieved while reconnecting */,
    conversationId: /* the conversationid you stored from previous conversation */
});
```

**Getting any history that Direct Line has cached** : you can retrieve history using watermarks:
You can see the watermark as an *activity 'bookmark'*. The resuming scenario will replay all the conversation activities from the watermark you specify.

```typescript
import { DirectLine } from 'botframework-directlinejs';

const dl = new DirectLine({
    token: /* the token you retrieved while reconnecting */,
    streamUrl: /* the streamUrl you retrieved while reconnecting */,
    conversationId: /* the conversationid you stored from previous conversation */,
    watermark: /* a watermark you saved from a previous conversation */,
    webSocket: false
});
```

A library for writing your own [Telegram](https://telegram.org/) bots. More information [here](https://core.telegram.org/bots). Official API [here](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api).

## Example
Here is a simple example (see [`example/simple.rs`](https://github.com/telegram-rs/telegram-bot/blob/master/lib/examples/simple.rs)):

``` rust
use std::env;

use futures::StreamExt;
use telegram_bot::*;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Error> {
    let token = env::var(""TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN"").expect(""TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN not set"");
    let api = Api::new(token);

    // Fetch new updates via long poll method
    let mut stream = api.stream();
    while let Some(update) = stream.next().await {
        // If the received update contains a new message...
        let update = update?;
        if let UpdateKind::Message(message) = update.kind {
            if let MessageKind::Text { ref data, .. } = message.kind {
                // Print received text message to stdout.
                println!(""<{}>: {}"", &message.from.first_name, data);

                // Answer message with ""Hi"".
                api.send(message.text_reply(format!(
                    ""Hi, {}! You just wrote '{}'"",
                    &message.from.first_name, data
                )))
                .await?;
            }
        }
    }
    Ok(())
}
```
You can find a bigger examples in the `examples`.

## Usage
This library is available via `crates.io`. In order to use it, just add this to your `Cargo.toml`:

```
telegram-bot = ""0.7""
```

The library allows you to do E2E-testing of your bot easily: just specify `TELEGRAM_API_URL` environment variable to point to your fake Telegram test server.
A lot of diagnostic information can be collected with [tracing](https://crates.io/crates/tracing) framework, see [`example/tracing.rs`](https://github.com/telegram-rs/telegram-bot/blob/master/lib/examples/tracing.rs)).

## Collaboration

You can add Calypso to your server with [this](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=416451977380364288&scope=bot&permissions=403008599) link! Alternatively, you can clone this repo and host the bot yourself.
```
git clone https://github.com/sabattle/CalypsoBot.git
```
After cloning, run an
```
npm install
```
to snag all of the dependencies. Of course, you need [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed. I also strongly recommend [nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon) as it makes testing *much* easier.

## Setting Up

You have to create a `config.json` file in order to run the bot (you can use the example file provided as a base). Your file should look something like this:
```
{
  ""token"": ""your_token_here"",
  ""ownerId"": ""your_ID_here"",
  ""bugReportChannelId"": ""bug_report_channel_ID_here"",
  ""feedbackChannelId"": ""feedback_channel_ID_here"",
  ""serverLogId"": ""server_log_ID_here"",
  ""apiKeys"": {
    ""catApi"": ""your_API_key_here"",
    ""googleApi"": ""your_API_key_here""
  }
}
```
Visit the Discord [developer portal](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/) to create an app and use the client token you are given for the `token` option. `ownerId` is your own Discord snowflake. `bugReportChannelId`, `feedbackChannelId`, and `serverLogId` should be set to respective text channels on your own server. To get keys for supported APIs, vist:

  * [TheCatAPI](https://thecatapi.com/)
  * [Google APIs](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/)

After your `config.json` file is built, you have enable `Privileged Intents` on your Discord [developer portal](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/). You can find these intents under the ""Bot"" section, and there are two ticks you have to switch on. For more information on Gateway Intents, check out [this](https://discordjs.guide/popular-topics/intents.html#the-intents-bit-field-wrapper) link.

Once done, feel free to launch Calypso using the command `node app.js` or `nodemon app.js`. If on Linux, you can also kick off using the `start.sh` script. If you need additional help setting up, join the [Calypso Support Server](https://discord.gg/pnYVdut)!

**Important Note:** Do not use Heroku to host Calypso! Calypso uses SQLite as its database which backs up its data store on disk. Heroku clears its contents often, so your database will be wiped. Read more [here](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/sqlite3).

### Emojis

If you are **self-hosting** Calypso, you may notice that the emojis for certain commands are not displaying. This is because Calypso uses **custom emojis** for a variety of her commands. These emojis will have to be added to your own server, and you will have to change the corresponding IDs in the `emojis.json` util if you would like to use them. Or, you can replace the emojis in `emojis.json` with ones you already have access to. If you would like to use Calypso's original custom emojis, hop into the [Calypso Support Server](https://discord.gg/pnYVdut) where you can snag them all.

### Colors

Upon being invited to a server, Calypso will automatically create **6** predefined colors for your server to enjoy. To add more, use the provided `createcolor` command to quickly and easily create new colors.

To add colors manually, first create a few empty roles at the bottom of your server's role hierarchy. The names of these roles must begin with the character `#`, for example, `#Red` or `#Blue`. Then change the color of that role to your desired hex, and that's it! After they are set up, the members of your server can then change their color by using Calypso's color commands!

## To-Do

Calypso is in a continuous state of development. New features/updates may come at any time. Some pending ideas are:

  * Music
  * Automod
  * Stream alerts
  * Custom tag/reaction system

This middleware plugin for [Botkit](http://howdy.ai/botkit) allows developers to easily integrate a [Watson Assistant](https://www.ibm.com/watson/ai-assistant/) workspace with multiple social channels like Slack, Facebook, and Twilio. Customers can have simultaneous, independent conversations with a single workspace through different channels.

## Middleware Overview

- Automatically manages context in multi-turn conversations to keep track of where the user left off in the conversation.
- Allows greater flexibility in message handling.
- Handles external databases for context storage.
- Easily integrates with third-party services.
- Exposes the following functions to developers:

## Function Overview

- `receive`: used as [middleware in Botkit](#bot-setup).
- `interpret`: an alias of `receive`, used in [message-filtering](#message-filtering) and [implementing app actions](#implementing-app-actions).
- `sendToWatson`: same as above, but it can update context before making request, used in [implementing app actions](#implementing-app-actions).
- `hear`: used for [intent matching](#intent-matching).
- `updateContext`: used in [implementing app actions](#implementing-app-actions) (sendToWatson does it better now).
- `readContext`: used in [implementing event handlers](#implementing-event-handlers).
- `before`: [pre-process](#before-and-after) requests before sending to Watson Assistant (formerly Conversation).
- `after`: [post-process](#before-and-after) responses before forwarding them to Botkit.
- `deleteUserData`: [deletes](#information-security) all data associated with a specified customer ID.

## Installation

```sh
$ npm install botkit-middleware-watson
```

## Prerequisites

### Create an instance of Watson Assistant

_💡 You can skip this step if you have credentials to access an existing instance of Watson Assistant. This would be the case for Cloud Pak for Data._

1. Sign up for an [IBM Cloud account](https://cloud.ibm.com/registration/).
1. Create an instance of the Watson Assistant service and get your credentials:
   - Go to the [Watson Assistant](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/assistant) page in the IBM Cloud Catalog.
   - Log in to your IBM Cloud account.
   - Click **Create**.
   - Copy the `apikey` value, or copy the `username` and `password` values if your service instance doesn't provide an `apikey`.
   - Copy the `url` value.

## Configure your Assistant

1. Create a workspace using the Watson Assistant service and copy the `workspace_id`. If you don't know how to create a workspace follow the [Getting Started tutorial](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/assistant/getting-started.html).

### Acquire channel credentials

This document shows code snippets for using a Slack bot with the middleware. You need a _Slack token_ for your Slack bot to talk to Watson Assistant. If you have an existing Slack bot, then copy the Slack token from your Slack settings page.

Otherwise, follow [Botkit's instructions](https://botkit.ai/docs/provisioning/slack-events-api.html) to create your Slack bot from scratch. When your bot is ready, you are provided with a Slack token.

### Bot setup

This section walks you through code snippets to set up your Slack bot. If you want, you can jump straight to the [full example](/examples/simple-bot).

In your app, add the following lines to create your Slack controller using Botkit:

```js
import { WatsonMiddleware } from 'botkit-middleware-watson';
import Botkit = require('botkit');
const { SlackAdapter } = require('botbuilder-adapter-slack');

const adapter = new SlackAdapter({
    clientSigningSecret: process.env.SLACK_SECRET,
    botToken: process.env.SLACK_TOKEN
});

const controller = new Botkit({
    adapter,
    // ...other options
});
```

Create the middleware object which you'll use to connect to the Watson Assistant service.

If your credentials are `username` and `password` use:

```js
const watsonMiddleware = new WatsonMiddleware({
  username: YOUR_ASSISTANT_USERNAME,
  password: YOUR_ASSISTANT_PASSWORD,
  url: YOUR_ASSISTANT_URL,
  workspace_id: YOUR_WORKSPACE_ID,
  version: '2018-07-10',
  minimum_confidence: 0.5, // (Optional) Default is 0.75
});
```

If your credentials is `apikey` use:

```js
const watsonMiddleware = new WatsonMiddleware({
  iam_apikey: YOUR_API_KEY,
  url: YOUR_ASSISTANT_URL,
  workspace_id: YOUR_WORKSPACE_ID,
  version: '2018-07-10',
  minimum_confidence: 0.5, // (Optional) Default is 0.75
});
```

If your service is running in the IBM Cloud Pak for Data use:

```js
const watsonMiddleware = new WatsonMiddleware({
  icp4d_url: YOUR_CLOUD_PAK_ASSISTANT_URL,
  icp4d_access_token: YOUR_CLOUD_PAK_ACCESS_TOKEN,
  disable_ssl_verification: true,
  workspace_id: YOUR_WORKSPACE_ID,
  version: '2018-07-10',
  minimum_confidence: 0.5, // (Optional) Default is 0.75
});
```

Tell your Slackbot to use the _watsonMiddleware_ for incoming messages:

```js
controller.middleware.receive.use(
  watsonMiddleware.receive.bind(watsonMiddleware),
);
```

Finally, make your bot _listen_ to incoming messages and respond with Watson Assistant:

```js
controller.hears(
  ['.*'],
  ['direct_message', 'direct_mention', 'mention'],
  async function(bot, message) {
    if (message.watsonError) {
      await bot.reply(
        message,
        ""I'm sorry, but for technical reasons I can't respond to your message"",
      );
    } else {
      await bot.reply(message, message.watsonData.output.text.join('\n'));
    }
  },
);
```

The middleware attaches the `watsonData` object to _message_. This contains the text response from Assistant.
If any error happened in middleware, error is assigned to `watsonError` property of the _message_.

Then you're all set!

## Features

### Message filtering

When middleware is registered, the receive function is triggered on _every_ message.
If you would like to make your bot to only respond to _direct messages_ using Assistant, you can achieve this in 2 ways:

#### Using interpret function instead of registering middleware

```js
slackController.hears(['.*'], ['direct_message'], async (bot, message) => {
  await middleware.interpret(bot, message);
  if (message.watsonError) {
    bot.reply(
      message,
      ""I'm sorry, but for technical reasons I can't respond to your message"",
    );
  } else {
    bot.reply(message, message.watsonData.output.text.join('\n'));
  }
});
```

#### Using middleware wrapper

```js
const receiveMiddleware = (bot, message, next) => {
  if (message.type === 'direct_message') {
    watsonMiddleware.receive(bot, message, next);
  } else {
    next();
  }
};

slackController.middleware.receive.use(receiveMiddleware);
```

### Minimum Confidence

To use the setup parameter `minimum_confidence`, you have multiple options:

#### Use it manually in your self-defined controller.hears() function(s)

For example:

```js
controller.hears(
  ['.*'],
  ['direct_message', 'direct_mention', 'mention', 'message_received'],
  async (bot, message) => {
    if (message.watsonError) {
      await bot.reply(message, 'Sorry, there are technical problems.'); // deal with watson error
    } else {
      if (message.watsonData.intents.length == 0) {
        await bot.reply(message, 'Sorry, I could not understand the message.'); // was any intent recognized?
      } else if (
        message.watsonData.intents[0].confidence <
        watsonMiddleware.minimum_confidence
      ) {
        await bot.reply(message, 'Sorry, I am not sure what you have said.'); // is the confidence high enough?
      } else {
        await bot.reply(message, message.watsonData.output.text.join('\n')); // reply with Watson response
      }
    }
  },
);
```

#### Use the middleware's hear() function

You can find the default implementation of this function [here](https://github.com/watson-developer-cloud/botkit-middleware/blob/e29b002f2a004f6df57ddf240a3fdf8cb28f95d0/lib/middleware/index.js#L40). If you want, you can redefine this function in the same way that watsonMiddleware.before and watsonMiddleware.after can be redefined. Refer to the [Botkit Middleware documentation](https://botkit.ai/docs/core.html#controllerhears) for an example. Then, to use this function instead of Botkit's default pattern matcher (that does not use minimum_confidence), plug it in using:

```js
controller.changeEars(watsonMiddleware.hear);
```

Note: if you want your own `hear()` function to implement pattern matching like Botkit's default one, you will likely need to implement that yourself. Botkit's default set of 'ears' is the `hears_regexp` function which is implemented [here](https://github.com/howdyai/botkit/blob/77b7d7f80c46d5c8194453667d22118b7850e252/lib/CoreBot.js#L1187).

### Implementing app actions

Watson Assistant side of app action is documented in [Developer Cloud](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/assistant/deploy-custom-app.html#deploy-custom-app)
A common scenario of processing actions is:

- Send message to user ""Please wait while I ...""
- Perform action
- Persist results in conversation context
- Send message to Watson with updated context
- Send result message(s) to user.

### Using sendToWatson to update context

```js
const checkBalance =  async (context) => {
  //do something real here
  const contextDelta = {
    validAccount: true,
    accountBalance: 95.33
  };
  return context;
});

const processWatsonResponse = async (bot, message) => {
  if (message.watsonError) {
    return await bot.reply(message, ""I'm sorry, but for technical reasons I can't respond to your message"");
  }
  if (typeof message.watsonData.output !== 'undefined') {
    //send ""Please wait"" to users
    await bot.reply(message, message.watsonData.output.text.join('\n'));

    if (message.watsonData.output.action === 'check_balance') {
      const newMessage = clone(message);
      newMessage.text = 'balance result';

      try {
        const contextDelta = await checkBalance(message.watsonData.context);
        await watsonMiddleware.sendToWatson(bot, newMessage, contextDelta);
      } catch(error) {
        newMessage.watsonError = error;
      }
      return await processWatsonResponse(bot, newMessage);
    }
  }
};

controller.on('message_received', processWatsonResponse);
```

### Using updateContext to update context

sendToWatson should cover majority of use cases,
but updateContext method can be useful when you want to update context from bot code,
but there is no need to make a special request to Watson.

```js
if (params.amount) {
  const context = message.watsonData.context;
  context.paymentAmount = params.amount;
  await watsonMiddleware.updateContext(message.user, context);
}
```

## Implementing event handlers

Events are messages having type different than `message`.

[Example](https://github.com/howdyai/botkit/blob/master/packages/docs/reference/facebook.md#facebookeventtypemiddleware) of handler:

```js
controller.on('facebook_postback', async (bot, message) => {
  await bot.reply(message, `Great Choice. (${message.payload})`);
});
```

Since they usually have no text, events aren't processed by middleware and have no watsonData attribute.
If event handler wants to make use of some data from context, it has to read it first.
Example:

```js
controller.on('facebook_postback', async (bot, message) => {
  const context = watsonMiddleware.readContext(message.user);
  //do something useful here
  const result = await myFunction(context.field1, context.field2);
  const newMessage = { ...message, text: 'postback result' };
  await watsonMiddleware.sendToWatson(bot, newMessage, {
    postbackResult: 'success',
  });
});
```

### Intent matching

The Watson middleware also includes a `hear()` function which provides a mechanism to
developers to fire handler functions based on the most likely intent of the user.
This allows a developer to create handler functions for specific intents in addition
to using the data provided by Watson to power the conversation.

The `hear()` function can be used on individual handler functions, or can be used globally.

Used on an individual handler:

```js
slackController.hears(
  ['hello'],
  ['direct_message', 'direct_mention', 'mention'],
  watsonMiddleware.hear,
  async function(bot, message) {
    await bot.reply(message, message.watsonData.output.text.join('\n'));
    // now do something special related to the hello intent
  },
);
```

Used globally:

```js
slackController.changeEars(watsonMiddleware.hear.bind(watsonMiddleware));

slackController.hears(
  ['hello'],
  ['direct_message', 'direct_mention', 'mention'],
  async (bot, message) => {
    await bot.reply(message, message.watsonData.output.text.join('\n'));
    // now do something special related to the hello intent
  },
);
```

#### `before` and `after`

The _before_ and _after_ async calls can be used to perform some tasks _before_ and _after_ Assistant is called. One may use it to modify the request/response payloads, execute business logic like accessing a database or making calls to external services.

They can be customized as follows:

```js
middleware.before = (message, assistantPayload) => async () => {
  // Code here gets executed before making the call to Assistant.
  return assistantPayload;
};
```

```js
middleware.after = (message, assistantResponse) => async () => {
  // Code here gets executed after the call to Assistant.
  return assistantResponse;
});
```

#### Dynamic workspace

If you need to make use of multiple workspaces in a single bot, `workspace_id` can be changed dynamically by setting `workspace_id` property in context.

Example of setting `workspace_id` to id provided as a property of hello message:

```js
async handleHelloEvent = (bot, message) => {
  message.type = 'welcome';
  const contextDelta = {};

  if (message.workspaceId) {
    contextDelta.workspace_id = message.workspaceId;
  }

  try {
    await watsonMiddleware.sendToWatson(bot, message, contextDelta);
  } catch(error) {
    message.watsonError = error;
  }
  await bot.reply(message, message.watsonData.output.text.join('\n'));
}

controller.on('hello', handleHelloEvent);
```

## Information security

It may be necessary to be to able delete message logs associated with particular customer in order to comply with
[GDPR or HIPPA regulations](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/assistant?topic=assistant-information-security#information-security)

### Labeling User Data

Messages can be labeled with customer id by adding `x-watson-metadata` header to request in `before` hook:

```js
watsonMiddleware.before = async (message, payload) => {
  // it is up to you to implement calculateCustomerId function
  customerId = calculateCustomerId(payload.context);
  payload.headers['X-Watson-Metadata'] = 'customer_id=' + customerId;

  return payload;
};
```

### Deleting User Data

```js
try {
  await watsonMiddleware.deleteUserData(customerId);
  //Customer data was deleted successfully
} catch (e) {
  //Failed to delete
}
```

# Flutter Modal Bottom Sheet

**BREAKING CHANGE IN 1.0.0** 

In the `builder` param remove `scrollController` and use `ModalScrollController.of(context)` instead to access the modal's scrollController. Check the CHANGELOG for more information

[![Awesome Flutter](https://img.shields.io/badge/Awesome-Flutter-blue.svg?longCache=true&style=flat-square)](https://github.com/Solido/awesome-flutter)
[![Pub](https://img.shields.io/pub/v/modal_bottom_sheet.svg?logo=flutter&color=blue&style=flat-square)](https://pub.dev/packages/modal_bottom_sheet)

Create awesome and powerful modal bottom sheets.

|  Cupertino Modal |  Multiple Modals |  Material Modal | Bar Modal  |  Create your own |

## Try it

Explore the [Web Demo](https://jamesblasco.github.io/modal_bottom_sheet/#/) or clone the repository. 

Why not `showModalBottomSheet`?

Inspired by `showModalBottomSheet`, it completes with some must-need features:

- Support for inside scrollview + dragging down to close (`showModalBottomSheet` won't work correctly with scrollviews. 
- Support for `WillPopScope` to prevent closing the dialog.
- Support for scroll to top when tapping status bar (iOS only)
- Cupertino modal bottom sheet
- Create custom modal bottom sheet


## First Steps

How to install it? [Follow Instructions](
https://pub.dev/packages/modal_bottom_sheet#-installing-tab-)

## Material Modal BottomSheet

```dart
showMaterialModalBottomSheet(
  context: context,
  builder: (context) => Container(),
)
```

#### Generic params for all modal bottom sheets

| Param | Description |
|---|---|
|bool expand = false| The `expand` parameter specifies id the modal bottom sheet will be full screen size or will fit the content child|
|bool useRootNavigator = false| The `useRootNavigator` parameter ensures that the root navigator is used to display the bottom sheet when set to `true`. This is useful in the case that a modal bottom sheet needs to be displayed above all other content but the caller is inside another `Navigator`. |
|bool isDismissible = true| The `isDismissible` parameter specifies whether the bottom sheet will be dismissed when user taps on the scrim. |
|Color barrierColor | The `barrierColor` parameter controls the color of the scrim for this route |
|bool enableDrag = true| The `enableDrag` parameter specifies whether the bottom sheet can be dragged up and down and dismissed by swiping downwards. |
|AnimationController secondAnimation| The `secondAnimation` parameter allows you to provide an animation controller that will be used to animate  push/pop of the modal route. Using this param is advised against and will be probably removed in future versions |
|bool bounce = false| The `bounce` parameter specifies if the bottom sheet can go beyond the top boundary while dragging |
|Duration duration = const Duration(milliseconds: 400)| The `duration` of modal opening |
|double closeProgressThreshold = 0.6| The `closeProgressThreshold` specifies when the bottom sheet will be dismissed when user drags it. |


#### Material params
The optional `backgroundColor`, `elevation`, `shape`, and `clipBehavior` parameters can be passed in to customize the appearance and behavior of material bottom sheets.

#### Using it with a scroll view inside 
Assign the `ModalScrollController.of(context)` to your primary modal to sync the scroll with the modal's drag 
```dart
showMaterialModalBottomSheet(
  context: context,
  builder: (context) => SingleChildScrollView(
    controller: ModalScrollController.of(context),
    child: Container(),
  ),
);
```

## Cupertino Modal BottomSheet

iOS 13 came with an amazing new modal navigation and now it is available to use with Flutter.


```dart
showCupertinoModalBottomSheet(
  context: context,
  builder: (context) => Container(),
)
```
See generic paramameter in the Material section above

#### Cupertino specific params
The optional `backgroundColor` parameters can be passed in to customize the backgroundColor cupertino bottom sheets.
Useful if you want a blurred transparent background as the example Cupertino Photo Share

### CAUTION!: To animate the previous route some changes are needed.
> **Why?**
> `MaterialPageRoute` and `CupertinoPageRoute` do not allow animated translation to/from routes that are not the same type. 


Replace your current route class with `MaterialWithModalsPageRoute`.


Notice this route type behaves the same as `MaterialPageRoute` and supports custom `PageTransitionsBuilder` and `PageTransitionsTheme`.



<details><summary>
  How can I replace my current route? </summary>


<details><summary> 1. 
 
 Using `Navigator.of(context).push`
 </summary>

```dart
Navigator.of(context).push(MaterialPageRoute(builder: (context) => Container()));`
```
 Replace it with 
 ```dart
 Navigator.of(context).push(MaterialWithModalsPageRoute(builder: (context) => Container()));
 ```

 Learn how to animate previous route with CupertinoScaffold: </summary>


1. Wrap previous route inside a `CupertinoScaffold`.
  Example with `routes` parameter from `MaterialApp` or `CupertinoApp`
  ```dart
    routes: <String, WidgetBuilder>{
      '/previous_route_where_you_push_modal': (BuildContext context) => CupertinoScaffold(body: Container()),
     },
   ```

2. Push modal with this method
 ```dart
 CupertinoScaffold.showCupertinoModalBottomSheet(context:context, builder: (context) => Container())
 ```

Don't use this solution at the same time as `MaterialWithModalsPageRoute`

 </details>

It supports native features as bouncing, blurred background, dark mode, stacking modals and inside navigation.

## Push new views inside the modal bottom sheet

a. If you want to push a new modal bottom sheet just call `showCupertinoModalBottomSheet` again (works with both options)

b. For inside navigaton add a new `Navigator` or `CupertinoTabScaffold` inside 

c. Also it supports flutter features as WillPopScope to prevent the modal bottom to be closed.

## Build other BottomSheets 

Try `showBarModalBottomSheet` for a bottomSheet with the appearance used by Facebook or Slack

Check in the example project `showAvatarModalBottomSheet` for how to create your own ModalBottomSheet

275,275,Ekliptor/WolfBot,TypeScript,"# WolfBot
This is the source of the Crypto currency trading bot running on: https://wolfbot.org

It is written in TypeScript for NodeJS + MongoDB.

## Features
* **Trading**: buying + selling, portfolio management (sync balances with exchanges)
* **Margin Trading**: leveraged trading including short selling and futures trading
* **Arbitrage**: profit from price differences between 2 exchanges (done ""on the books"" with balances on both exchanges, no withdrawals from exchanges required)
* **Lending**: lend your coins on the lending market of supported crypto exchanges for the highest possible interest rates
* **Backtesting**: test your trade strategies in simulation on historical data
* **Web Plugins**: [Access social media data](https://wolfbot.org/social-sentiment/) from Twitter, Reddit, Telegram Channels, RSS Feeds,... to trade based on news and real world events (not part of open source version yet)


### Key trading advantages
* **Indicators**: Over 200 technical indicators (MACD, RSI, EMA,..), candlestick pattern recognition (Doji, Tri-Star,...) of 20+ most common patterns, Fibonacci Retracements (upwards & downwards), automatic trendline (support & resistance) detection
* **Strategy events**: All strategies emit buy/sell events that can be forwarded to other strategies using different candle sizes before trade execution. This gives you the ability to easily configure your bot to “zoom in” on candlestick chart data (for example from 12h candles trendline to 1h MACD to 10min RSI).
* **Realtime**: Trades come in realtime via websocket connection from the exchange. Strategies can process (and react) on every single trade. Furthermore all indicators can be updated within the current (latest) candle as new data comes in.
* **Backtesting**: Advanced automatic parameter optimization using:
    * the Cartesian product to try all permutations of given config parameters or
    * a genetic algorithm to find the most profitable config parameters within given parameter ranges

Additionally WolfBot supports over 130 exchanges using [CCXT Library](https://github.com/ccxt/ccxt) (no WebSockets, no margin trading).

The full strategy documentation: https://wolfbot.org/strategy-docs/

## Getting Started

### Requirements
```
NodeJS >= 12 && <= 14
MongoDB >= 4.0
TypeScript >= 3.5
yarn >= 1.9.4 (npm should work too, but no support given if you run into errors)
Webpack >= 4 (only for UI modifications)
```


### Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/Ekliptor/WolfBot
yarn install
```
You can use the `--production` flag if you only want to run the bot and not make any code changes.


### Start trading
Rename the `configLocal-sample.ts` file in the project root directory to `configLocal.ts` and add at least `mongoUrl` (plus some exchange API keys if you want to trade).


After running TypeScript (automatically in your IDE or run the `tsc` command in the project root dir) you will see a file:
```
build/app.js
```
`tsc` will show you some errors (due to shared code with missing types between server and client side, I will refactor this later). Just ignore these errors and make sure `noEmitOnError` is not set (the default) and that you have a `build/` dir in the project root as well as for all packages under `node_modules/@ekliptor` which contain a `tsconfig.json` file. Use the `build` directory as the working directory and run:
```
node app.js --debug --config=Noop --trader=RealTimeTrader --noUpdate --noBrowser
```
The `config` parameter must be a JSON file from the `config` directory. For a list of all parameters look at the top of the `app.ts` file.

### Docker support
To you can install WolfBot with all its dependencies using Docker:
```
docker-compose up
```


### Writing your own trading strategies
There is documentation available here: https://forum.wolfbot.org/forums/strategy-development.17/

Look into the `/src/Strategies` folder for more examples.

[Outgoing trades flow diagram](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ekliptor/WolfBot/master/tests/docs/diagram-outgoing.png)



### Modifying the UI
In the project root directory, run:
```
yarn watch
```

You should also run the bot with the `--uiDev` flag so that changes to HTML template files are reloaded from disk.

The UI uses a single persistent WebSocket connection. UI related code is in the following directories:
```
├ project root
├─── public <- all code shipped to the browser
├────── js <- all TypeScript code to be compiled with WebPack
├─── src
├────── WebSocket <- all server-side logic to push updates to the browser
├─── views <- all HTML templates
```


## REST and WebSocket JSON APIs
If you want to connect WolfBot to your trading terminal, please take a look at the [API docs](https://github.com/Ekliptor/WolfBot/blob/master/tests/docs/WolfBot%20API.pdf).

This let's you:
* create new cloud bot instances and earn commission for every referral (not applicable to open source version)
* import the trades book with all trades WolfBot made via REST API call
* subscribe to live trades via WebSocket to display them in your trading terminal
* subscribe to live strategy data and indicator values via WebSocket

278,278,adeshpande3/Facebook-Messenger-Bot,Python,"# Facebook-Messenger-Bot

The FB Messenger chatbot that I trained to talk like me. The associated [blog post](https://adeshpande3.github.io/adeshpande3.github.io/How-I-Used-Deep-Learning-to-Train-a-Chatbot-to-Talk-Like-Me).

## Overview

For this project, I wanted to train a Sequence To Sequence model on my past conversation logs from various social media sites. You can read more about the motivation behind this approach, the details of the ML model, and the purpose of each Python script in the blog post, but I want to use this README to explain how you can train your own chatbot to talk like you.

## Requirements and Installation
In order to run these scripts, you'll need the following libraries.

* **[TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/) version 1.0 or later**
* [NumPy](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/user/install.html)
* [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/install.html)
* [Sklearn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html)

## How You Can Train Your Own

1. Download and unzip [this entire repository from GitHub](https://github.com/adeshpande3/Facebook-Messenger-Bot), either interactively, or by entering the following in your Terminal.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/adeshpande3/Facebook-Messenger-Bot.git
    ```

2. Navigate into the top directory of the repo on your machine
    ```bash
    cd Facebook-Messenger-Bot
    ```
3. Our first job is to download all of your conversation data from various social media sites. For me, I used Facebook, Google Hangouts, and LinkedIn. If you have other sites that you're getting data from, that's fine. You just will have to create a new method in [createDataset.py](https://github.com/adeshpande3/Facebook-Messenger-Bot/blob/master/createDataset.py).

* **Facebook Data**: Download your data from [here](https://www.facebook.com/help/131112897028467). Once downloaded, you should have a fairly large file called **messages.htm**. It'll be a pretty large file (over 190 MB for me). We're going to need to parse through this large file, and extract all of the conversations. To do this, we'll use this [tool](https://github.com/ownaginatious/fbchat-archive-parser) that Dillon Dixon has kindly open sourced. You'll go ahead and install that tool by running
    ```bash
    pip install fbchat-archive-parser
    ```    
    and then running:
    ```bash
    fbcap ./messages.htm > fbMessages.txt
    ```
    This will give you all your Facebook conversations in a fairly unified text file. Thanks Dillon! Go ahead and then store that file in your Facebook-Messenger-Bot folder.

* **LinkedIn Data**: Download your data from [here](https://www.linkedin.com/psettings/member-data). Once downloaded, you should see an **inbox.csv** file. We won't need to take any other steps here, we just want to copy it over to our folder.

* **Google Hangouts Data**: Download your data form [here](https://takeout.google.com/settings/takeout/custom/chat). Once downloaded, you'll get a JSON file that we'll need to parse through. To do this, we'll use this [parser](https://takeout.google.com/settings/takeout/custom/chat) found through this phenomenal [blog post](https://blog.jay2k1.com/2014/11/10/how-to-export-and-backup-your-google-hangouts-chat-history/). We'll want to save the data into text files, and then copy the folder over to ours.

    At the end of all this, you should have a directory structure that looks like this. Make sure you rename the folders and file names if yours are different.

    ![](Images/DirectoryStructure.png)

* **Discord Data** : You can extract your discord chatlogs by using this awesome [DiscordChatExporter](https://github.com/Tyrrrz/DiscordChatExporter) made by [Tyrrrz](https://github.com/Tyrrrz). Follow its documentation to extract your desired singular chat logs in `.txt` format (this is important). You can then put them all in a folder named `DiscordChatLogs` in the repo directory.

* **WhatsApp Data**: Make sure you have a cell phone and put it in the US date-format if it is not already (this will be important later when you parse the log file to .csv). You can not use whatsApp web for this purpose. Open the chat you want to send, tap the menu button, tap more, then click ""Email Chat"". Send the email to yourself and download it to your computer. This will give you a .txt file, to parse it, we'll convert it to .csv. To do this go to [this link](http://ocpl.com.bd/whatsapp_parser/) and enter all the text in your log file. Click export, download the csv file and simply store it in your Facebook-Messenger-Bot folder under the name ""whatsapp_chats.csv"".

  **NOTE**: The parser provided in the above link seems to have been removed. If you still have a `.csv` file *in the correct format*, you may still use that. Otherwise download your whatsapp chat logs as `.txt` files and put them all in a folder named `WhatsAppChatLogs` in the repo directory. `createDataset.py` will work with these files instead if, and only if, it **DOES NOT** find a `.csv` file named `whatsapp_chats.csv`.
  
    In case you use `.txt` chat logs, note that the expected format is-
    ```
    [20.06.19, 15:58:57] Loris: Welcome to the chat example
    [20.06.19, 15:59:07] John: Thanks
    ```
    (OR)
    ```
    12/28/19, 21:43 - Loris: Welcome to the chat example
    12/28/19, 21:43 - John: Thanks
    ```

4. Now that we have all our conversation logs in a clean format, we can go ahead and create our dataset. In our directory, let's run:
    ```bash
    python createDataset.py
    ```
    You'll then be prompted to enter your name (so that the script knows who to look for), and which social media sites you have data for. This script will create a file named **conversationDictionary.npy** which is a Numpy object that contains pairs in the form of (FRIENDS_MESSAGE, YOUR RESPONSE). A file named **conversationData.txt** will also be created. This is simply a large text file the dictionary data in a unified form.

5. Now that we have those 2 files, we can start creating our word vectors through a Word2Vec model. This step is a little different from the others. The Tensorflow function we see later on (in seq2seq.py) actually also handles the embedding part. So you can either decide to train your own vectors or have the seq2seq function do it jointly, which is what I ended up doing.**If you want to create your own word vectors though Word2Vec, say y at the prompt (after running the following). If you don't, then that's fine, reply n and this function will only create the wordList.txt.**
    ```bash
    python Word2Vec.py
    ```
    If you run word2vec.py in its entirety, this will create 4 different files. **Word2VecXTrain.npy** and **Word2VecYTrain.npy** are the training matrices that Word2Vec will use. We save these in our folder, in case we need to train our Word2Vec model again with different hyperparameters. We also save **wordList.txt**, which simply contains all of the unique words in our corpus. The last file saved is **embeddingMatrix.npy**  which is a Numpy matrix that contains all of the generatedword vectors.

6. Now, we can use create and train our Seq2Seq model.
    ```bash
    python Seq2Seq.py
    ```
    This will create 3 or more different files. **Seq2SeqXTrain.npy** and **Seq2SeqYTrain.npy** are the training matrices that Seq2Seq will use. Again, we save these just in case we want to make changes to our model architecture, and we don't want to recompute our training set. The last file(s) will be .ckpt files which holds our saved Seq2Seq model. Models will be saved at different time periods in the training loop. These will be used and deployed once we've created our chatbot.

7. Now that we have a saved model, let's now create our Facebook chatbot. To do so, I'd recommend following this [tutorial](https://github.com/jw84/messenger-bot-tutorial). You don't need to read anything beneath the ""Customize what the bot says"" section. Our Seq2Seq model will handle that part. **IMPORTANT - The tutorial will tell you to create a new folder where the Node project will lie.** Keep in mind this folder will be different from our folder. You can think of this folder as being where our data preprocessing and model training lie, while the other folder is strictly reserved for the Express app (EDIT: I believe you can follow the tutorial's steps inside of our folder and just create the Node project, Procfile, and index.js files in here if you want). The tutorial itself should be sufficient, but here's a summary of the steps.

    - Build the server, and host on Heroku.
    - Create a Facebook App/Page, set up the webhook, get page token, and trigger the app.
    - Add an API endpoint to **index.js** so that the bot can respond with messages.

    After following the steps correctly, you should be able to message the chatbot, and get responses back.

    ![](Images/DefaultChatbotResponse.png)

8. Ah, you're almost done! Now, we have to create a Flask server where we can deploy our saved Seq2Seq model. I have the code for that server [here](https://github.com/adeshpande3/Chatbot-Flask-Server). Let's talk about the general structure. Flask servers normally have one main .py file where you define all of the endpoints. This will be [app.py](https://github.com/adeshpande3/Chatbot-Flask-Server/blob/master/app.py) in our case. This whill be where we load in our model. You should create a folder called 'models', and fill it with 4 files (a checkpoint file, a data file, an index file, and a meta file). These are the files that get created when you save a Tensorflow model.

![](Images/Models.png)

In this app.py file, we want to create a route (/prediction in my case) where the input to the route will be fed into our saved model, and the decoder output is the string that is returned. Go ahead and take a closer look at app.py if that's still a bit confusing. Now that you have your app.py and your models (and other helper files if you need them), you can deploy your server. We'll be using Heroku again. There are a lot of different tutorials on deploying Flask servers to Heroku, but I like [this one](https://coderwall.com/p/pstm1w/deploying-a-flask-app-at-heroku) in particular (Don't need the Foreman and Logging sections).

9. Once you have your Flask server deployed, you'll need to edit your index.js file so that the Express app can communicate with your Flask server. Basically, you'll need to send a POST request to the Flask server with the input message that your chatbot receives, receive the output, and then use the sendTextMessage function to have the chatbot respond to the message. If you've cloned my repository, all you really need to do is replace the URL of the request function call with the URL of your own server.

There ya go. You should be able to send messages to the chatbot, and see some interesting responses that (hopefully) resemble yourelf in some way.

## Getting Google OAuth API credential file

- Visit the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials)
- Go to the OAuth Consent tab, fill it, and save.
- Go to the Credentials tab and click Create Credentials -> OAuth Client ID
- Choose Other and Create.
- Use the download button to download your credentials.
- Move that file to the root of clone-bot, and rename it to credentials.json
- Visit [Google API page](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/library)
- Search for Drive and enable it if it is disabled
- Finally, run the script to generate token file (token.pickle) for Google Drive:
```
pip install google-api-python-client google-auth-httplib2 google-auth-oauthlib
python3 generate_drive_token.py
```
# Running
- To run this bot (locally) (suggested)
```
python3 -m bot
```
- Deploying to Heroku (Optional) (Not Suitable for very big Clones!)

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://dashboard.heroku.com/new?template=https://github.com/jagrit007/Telegram-CloneBot)

- Please know that after using this button, your work isn't done. You gotta [clone heroku app](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/git-clone-heroku-app) and add credentials.json and token.pickle (By now you would know how to make it.) and this is the perfect time to generate service accounts if you wish to use them. After it's all done, [Push changes to Heroku (Step1-2 only).](https://docs.railsbridge.org/intro-to-rails/deploying_to_heroku_again)

**Tip: Instead of using Termux or local machine, use [repl.it](https://repl.it/), atleast it won't throw any errors in installing Python requirements. From [repl.it](https://repl.it/) you could push to a private GitHub repo and attach that to Heroku.**


# Using service accounts for uploading to avoid user rate limit
For Service Account to work, you must set USE_SERVICE_ACCOUNTS=True in config file or environment variables
Many thanks to [AutoRClone](https://github.com/xyou365/AutoRclone) for the scripts
## Generating service accounts
Step 1. Generate service accounts [What is service account](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-accounts)
---------------------------------
Let us create only the service accounts that we need. 
**Warning:** abuse of this feature is not the aim of autorclone and we do **NOT** recommend that you make a lot of projects, just one project and 100 sa allow you plenty of use, its also possible that overabuse might get your projects banned by google. 

```
Note: 1 service account can copy around 750gb a day, 1 project makes 100 service accounts so thats 75tb a day, for most users this should easily suffice. 
```

`python3 gen_sa_accounts.py --quick-setup 1 --new-only`

A folder named accounts will be created which will contain keys for the service accounts created

NOTE: If you have created SAs in past from this script, you can also just re download the keys by running:
```
python3 gen_sa_accounts.py --download-keys project_id
```

### Add all the service accounts to the Team Drive or folder
- Run:
```
python3 add_to_team_drive.py -d SharedTeamDriveSrcID
```

An open source chatbot framework written in Python. It is designed to be extendable, scalable and simple.

This framework is designed to take events from chat services and other sources and execute Python functions (skills) based on their contents. Those functions can be anything you like, from simple conversational responses to running complex tasks. The true power of this project is to act as a glue library to bring the multitude of natural language APIs, chat services and third-party APIs together.

See [our full documentation](https://docs.opsdroid.dev) to get started.

**Warning**: As of December 4th, 2020 Slack no longer accept resubmissions from apps that are not using granular permissions, or so-called ""classic apps"". On November 18, 2021 Slack will start delisting apps that have not migrated to use granular permissions. This library implements legacy, real-time support for classic apps. You should not be building a new bot with it and use [slack-ruby-bot-server-events](https://github.com/slack-ruby/slack-ruby-bot-server-events) instead. For a rudimentary bot you can even start with [slack-ruby-bot-server-events-app-mentions](https://github.com/slack-ruby/slack-ruby-bot-server-events-app-mentions). See [MIGRATION](MIGRATION.md) for migration help.

---

The slack-ruby-bot library is a generic Slack bot framework written in Ruby on top of [slack-ruby-client](https://github.com/slack-ruby/slack-ruby-client). This library does all the heavy lifting, such as message parsing, so you can focus on implementing slack bot commands. It also attempts to introduce the bare minimum number of requirements or any sorts of limitations. It's a Slack bot boilerplate.

If you are not familiar with Slack bots or Slack API concepts, you might want to watch [this video](http://code.dblock.org/2016/03/11/your-first-slack-bot-service-video.html).

## Useful to Me?

* If you are just trying to send messages to Slack, use [slack-ruby-client](https://github.com/slack-ruby/slack-ruby-client), which this library is built on top of.
* If you're trying to roll out a full service with Slack button integration, check out [slack-ruby-bot-server](https://github.com/slack-ruby/slack-ruby-bot-server), which uses this library.
* Otherwise, this piece of the puzzle will help you create a single bot instance for one team.

## Stable Release

You're reading the documentation for the **next** release of slack-ruby-bot.
Please see the documentation for the [last stable release, v0.16.1](https://github.com/slack-ruby/slack-ruby-bot/tree/v0.16.1) unless you're integrating with HEAD.
See [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) for a history of changes and [UPGRADING](UPGRADING.md) for how to upgrade to more recent versions.

## Usage

### A Minimal Bot

#### Gemfile

```ruby
source 'https://rubygems.org'

gem 'slack-ruby-bot'
gem 'async-websocket', '~>0.8.0'
```

#### pongbot.rb

```ruby
require 'slack-ruby-bot'

class PongBot < SlackRubyBot::Bot
  command 'ping' do |client, data, match|
    client.say(text: 'pong', channel: data.channel)
  end
end

PongBot.run
```

After [registering the bot](DEPLOYMENT.md), run with `SLACK_API_TOKEN=... bundle exec ruby pongbot.rb`. Have the bot join a channel and send it a ping.

![](screenshots/demo.gif)

### A Production Bot

A typical production Slack bot is a combination of a vanilla web server and a websocket application that talks to the Slack Real Time Messaging API. See our [Writing a Production Bot](TUTORIAL.md) tutorial for more information.

### More Involved Examples

The following examples of bots based on slack-ruby-bot are listed in growing order of complexity.

* [slack-bot-on-rails](https://github.com/dblock/slack-bot-on-rails): A bot running on Rails and using React to display Slack messages on a website.
* [slack-mathbot](https://github.com/dblock/slack-mathbot): Slack integration with math.
* [slack-google-bot](https://github.com/dblock/slack-google-bot): A Slack bot that searches Google, including CSE.
* [slack-aws](https://github.com/dblock/slack-aws): Slack integration with Amazon Web Services.
* [slack-deploy-bot](https://github.com/accessd/slack-deploy-bot): A Slack bot that helps you to deploy your apps.
* [slack-gamebot](https://github.com/dblock/slack-gamebot): A game bot service for ping pong, chess, etc, hosted at [playplay.io](http://playplay.io).
* [slack-victorbot](https://github.com/uShip/victorbot): A Slack bot to talk to the Victorops service.

### Commands and Operators

Bots are addressed by name, they respond to commands and operators. You can combine multiple commands.

```ruby
class CallBot < SlackRubyBot::Bot
  command 'call', '呼び出し' do |client, data, match|
    client.say(channel: data.channel, text: 'called')
  end
end
```

Command match data includes `match['bot']`, `match['command']` and `match['expression']`. The `bot` match always checks against the `SlackRubyBot::Config.user` and `SlackRubyBot::Config.user_id` values obtained when the bot starts.

The `command` method can take strings, which will have to be escaped with `Regexp.escape`, and regular expressions.

```ruby
class CallBot < SlackRubyBot::Bot
  command 'string with spaces', /some\s*regex+\?*/ do |client, data, match|
    client.say(channel: data.channel, text: match['command'])
  end
end
```

Operators are 1-letter long and are similar to commands. They don't require addressing a bot nor separating an operator from its arguments. The following class responds to `=2+2`.

```ruby
class MathBot < SlackRubyBot::Bot
  operator '=' do |client, data, match|
    # implementation detail
  end
end
```

Operator match data includes `match['operator']` and `match['expression']`. The `bot` match always checks against the `SlackRubyBot::Config.user` setting.

### Threaded Messages

To reply to a message in a thread you must provide a reference to the first message that initiated the thread, which is available as either `data.ts` if no threaded messages have been sent, or `data.thread_ts` if the message being replied to is already in a thread. See [message-threading](https://api.slack.com/docs/message-threading) for more information.

```ruby
command 'reply in thread' do |client, data, match|
  client.say(
    channel: data.channel,
    text: ""let's avoid spamming everyone, I will tell you what you need in this thread"",
    thread_ts: data.thread_ts || data.ts
  )
end
```

_Note that sending a message using only `thread_ts: data.ts` can cause some permanent issues where Slack will keep reporting inaccessible messages as unread. At the time of writing the slack team is still having problems clearing those notifications. As recommended by the slack documentation ..._

> A true parent's thread_ts should be used when replying. Providing a child's message ID will result in a new, detached thread breaking all context and sense.

_... the replies to a thread should always be sent to the message `ts` that started the thread, available as `thread_ts` for subsequent messages. Hence `data.thread_ts || data.ts`._

For additional options, including broadcasting, see [slack-ruby-client#chat_postMessage](https://github.com/slack-ruby/slack-ruby-client/blob/41539c647ac877400f20aa338aa42d2ebfd2866b/lib/slack/web/api/endpoints/chat.rb#L105).

### Bot Aliases

A bot will always respond to its name (eg. `rubybot`) and Slack ID (eg. `@rubybot`), but you can specify multiple aliases via the `SLACK_RUBY_BOT_ALIASES` environment variable or via an explicit configuration.

```
SLACK_RUBY_BOT_ALIASES=:pp: table-tennis
```

```ruby
SlackRubyBot.configure do |config|
  config.aliases = [':pong:', 'pongbot']
end
```

![](screenshots/aliases.gif)

Bots will also respond to a direct message, with or without the bot name in the message itself.

![](screenshots/dms.gif)

### Generic Routing

Commands and operators are generic versions of bot routes. You can respond to just about anything by defining a custom route.

```ruby
class Weather < SlackRubyBot::Bot
  match /^How is the weather in (?<location>\w*)\?$/ do |client, data, match|
    client.say(channel: data.channel, text: ""The weather in #{match[:location]} is nice."")
  end
end
```

![](screenshots/weather.gif)

You can also capture multiple matchers with `scan`.

```ruby
class Market < SlackRubyBot::Bot
  scan(/([A-Z]{2,5})/) do |client, data, stocks|
    # lookup stock market price
  end
end
```

![](screenshots/market.gif)

See [examples/market](examples/market/marketbot.rb) for a working example.

### Matching text in message attachments

You can respond to text in [attachments](https://api.slack.com/docs/message-attachments) with
`attachment`. It will scan `text`, `pretext` and `title` fields in each attachment until a first
match is found.

For example you can match [this example attachment](http://goo.gl/K0cLkH)
by its `title` with the following bot:

```ruby
class Attachment < SlackRubyBot::Bot
  attachment 'Slack API Documentation' do |client, data, match|
    client.say(channel: data.channel, text: ""Matched by #{match.attachment_field}."")
    client.say(channel: data.channel, text: ""The attachment's text: #{match.attachment.text}."")
  end
end
```

You can also define which fields in attachment object should be scanned.

Scan only a single field:

```ruby
class Attachment < SlackRubyBot::Bot
  attachment 'Slack API Documentation', :title do |client, data, match|
    # implementation details
  end
end
```

Scan multiple fields:

```ruby
class Attachment < SlackRubyBot::Bot
  attachment 'Slack API Documentation', %i[text pretext author_name] do |client, data, match|
    # implementation details
  end
end
```

### Providing description for your bot and commands

You can specify help information for bot or commands with `help` block, for example:

in case of bot:

```ruby
class WeatherBot < SlackRubyBot::Bot
  help do
    title 'Weather Bot'
    desc 'This bot tells you the weather.'

    command 'clouds' do
      desc 'Tells you how many clouds there\'re above you.'
    end

    command 'What\'s the weather in <city>?' do
      desc 'Tells you the weather in a <city>.'
      long_desc ""Accurate 10 Day Weather Forecasts for thousands of places around the World.\n"" \
        'Bot provides detailed Weather Forecasts over a 10 day period updated four times a day.'
    end
  end

  # commands implementation
end
```

![](screenshots/help.png)

in case of your own command:

```ruby
class Deploy < SlackRubyBot::Commands::Base
  help do
    title 'deploy'
    desc 'deploys your app'
    long_desc 'command format: *deploy <branch> to <env>* where <env> is production or staging'
  end
end
```

### Customize your command help output

If you've used the `help` block described above to document your
commands, you can provide your own implementation of outputting help
for commands like so:

```ruby
class Market < SlackRubyBot::Bot
  command 'help' do |client, data, match|
    user_command = match[:expression]
    help_attrs = SlackRubyBot::Commands::Support::Help.instance.find_command_help_attrs(user_command)
    client.say(channel: data.channel, text: ""#{help_attrs.command_desc}\n\n#{help_attrs.command_long_desc}"")
  end
end
```

### SlackRubyBot::Commands::Base

The `SlackRubyBot::Bot` class is DSL sugar deriving from `SlackRubyBot::Commands::Base`. For more involved bots you can organize the bot implementation into subclasses of `SlackRubyBot::Commands::Base` manually. By default a command class responds, case-insensitively, to its name. A class called `Phone` that inherits from `SlackRubyBot::Commands::Base` responds to `phone` and `Phone` and calls the `call` method when implemented.

```ruby
class Phone < SlackRubyBot::Commands::Base
  command 'call'

  def self.call(client, data, match)
    client.say(channel: data.channel, text: 'called')
  end
end
```

To respond to custom commands and to disable automatic class name matching, use the `command` keyword. The following command responds to `call` and `呼び出し` (call in Japanese).

```ruby
class Phone < SlackRubyBot::Commands::Base
  command 'call'
  command '呼び出し'

  def self.call(client, data, match)
    client.say(channel: data.channel, text: 'called')
  end
end
```

### Authorization

The framework does not provide any user authentication or command authorization capability out of the box. However, the `SlackRubyBot::Commands::Base` class does check every command invocation for permission prior to executing the command. The default method always returns true.

Therefore, subclasses of `SlackRubyBot::Commands::Base` can override the `permitted?` private method to provide its own authorization logic. This method is intended to be exploited by user code or external gems that want to provide custom authorization logic for command execution.

```ruby
class AuthorizedBot < SlackRubyBot::Commands::Base
  command 'phone home' do |client, data, match|
    client.say(channel: data.channel, text: 'Elliot!')
  end

  # Only allow user 'Uxyzabc' to run this command
  def self.permitted?(client, data, match)
    data && data.user && data.user == 'Uxyzabc'
  end
end
```

### Built-In Commands

Slack-ruby-bot comes with several built-in commands. You can re-define built-in commands, normally, as described above.

#### [bot name]

This is also known as the `default` command. Shows bot version and links.

#### [bot name] hi

Politely says 'hi' back.

#### [bot name] help

Get help.

### Hooks

Hooks are event handlers and respond to Slack RTM API [events](https://api.slack.com/events), such as [hello](lib/slack-ruby-bot/hooks/hello.rb) or [message](lib/slack-ruby-bot/hooks/message.rb). You can implement your own in a couple of ways:

#### Implementing and registering a Hook Handler

A Hook Handler is any object that respond to a `call` message, like a proc, instance of an object, class with a `call` class method, etc.

Hooks can be registered using different methods based on user preference / use case.
Currently someone can use one of the following methods:

* Pass `hooks` in `SlackRubyBot::Server` initialization.
* Register `hooks` on `SlackRubyBot::Server` using `on` class method.
* Register `hooks` on `SlackRubyBot::Server` using `on` instance method.


##### Hooks registration on `SlackRubyBot::Server` initialization

```ruby
SlackRubyBot::Server.new(hook_handlers: {
  hello: MyBot::Hooks::UserChange.new,
  user_change: [->(client, data) {  }, ->(client, data) {}]
})
```

##### Hooks registration on a `SlackRubyBot::Server` instance

```ruby
# Register an object that implements `call` method
class MyBot::Hooks::Hello
  def call(client, data)
    puts ""Hello""
  end
end

server.on(:hello, MyBot::Hooks::Hello.new)

# or register a lambda function to handle the event
server.on(:hello, ->(client, data) { puts ""Hello!"" })
```

For example, the following hook handles [user_change](https://api.slack.com/events/user_change), an event sent when a team member updates their profile or data. This can be useful to update the local user cache when a user is renamed.

```ruby
module MyBot
  module Hooks
    class UserChange
      def call(client, data)
        # data['user']['id'] contains the user ID
        # data['user']['name'] contains the new user name
        # ...
      end
    end
  end
end
```

##### Hooks registration on `SlackRubyBot::Server` class

Example:

```ruby
module MyBot
  class MyServer < SlackRubyBot::Server
    on 'hello' do |client, data|
      # data['user']['id'] contains the user ID
      # data['user']['name'] contains the new user name
    end

    on 'user_change', ->(client, data) {
      # data['user']['id'] contains the user ID
      # data['user']['name'] contains the new user name
    }
  end
end
```

These will get pushed into the hook set on initialization.

Either by configuration, explicit assignment or hook blocks, multiple handlers can exist for the same event type.

### Bot Message Protection

By default bots do not respond to self or other bots. If you wish to change that behavior globally, set `allow_bot_messages` to `true`.

```ruby
SlackRubyBot.configure do |config|
  config.allow_bot_messages = true
end
```

### Message Loop Protection

By default bots do not respond to their own messages. If you wish to change that behavior globally, set `allow_message_loops` to `true`.

```ruby
SlackRubyBot.configure do |config|
  config.allow_message_loops = true
end
```

### Logging

By default bots set a logger to `$stdout` with `DEBUG` level. The logger is used in both the RealTime and Web clients.

Silence logger as follows.

```ruby
SlackRubyBot::Client.logger.level = Logger::WARN
```

If you wish to customize logger, set `logger` to your logger.

```ruby
SlackRubyBot.configure do |config|
  config.logger = Logger.new(""slack-ruby-bot.log"", ""daily"")
end
```

### Advanced Integration

You may want to integrate a bot or multiple bots into other systems, in which case a globally configured bot may not work for you. You may create instances of [SlackRubyBot::Server](lib/slack-ruby-bot/server.rb) which accepts `token` and `aliases`.

```ruby
EM.run do
  bot1 = SlackRubyBot::Server.new(token: token1, aliases: ['bot1'])
  bot1.start_async

  bot2 = SlackRubyBot::Server.new(token: token2, aliases: ['bot2'])
  bot2.start_async
end
```

For an example of advanced integration that supports multiple teams, see [slack-gamebot](https://github.com/dblock/slack-gamebot) and [playplay.io](http://playplay.io) that is built on top of it.

### Proxy Configuration

There are [several proxy options](https://github.com/slack-ruby/slack-ruby-client#web-client-options) that can be configured on `Slack::Web::Client`. You can also control what proxy options are used by modifying the `http_proxy` environment variable per [Net::HTTP's documentation](https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/2.0.0/Net/HTTP.html#class-Net::HTTP-label-Proxies).

Note that Docker on OSX seems to incorrectly set the proxy, [causing `Faraday::ConnectionFailed`](https://github.com/slack-ruby/slack-ruby-bot/issues/155), `ERROR -- : Failed to open TCP connection to : (getaddrinfo: Name or service not known)`. You might need to manually unset `http_proxy` in that case, eg. `http_proxy="""" bundle exec ruby ./my_bot.rb`.

### Model-View-Controller Design

The `command` method is essentially a controller method that receives input from the outside and acts upon it. Complex behaviors could lead to a long and difficult-to-understand `command` block. A complex `command` block is a candidate for separation into classes conforming to the Model-View-Controller pattern popularized by Rails.

The library provides three helpful base classes named `SlackRubyBot::MVC::Model::Base`, `SlackRubyBot::MVC::View::Base`, and `SlackRubyBot::MVC::Controller::Base`.

Testing a `command` block is difficult. As separate classes, the Model/View/Controller's behavior can be tested via `rspec` or a similar tool.

#### Controller

The Controller is the focal point of the bot behavior. Typically the code that would go into the `command` block will now go into an instance method in a Controller subclass. The instance method name should match the command name exactly (case sensitive).

As an example, these two classes are functionally equivalent.

Consider the following `Agent` class which is the simplest default approach to take.

```ruby
class Agent < SlackRubyBot::Bot
  command 'sayhello', 'alternate way to call hello' do |client, data, match|
    client.say(channel: data.channel, text: ""Received command #{match[:command]} with args #{match[:expression]}"")
  end
end
```

Using the MVC functionality, we would create a controller instead to encapsulate this function.
```ruby
class MyController < SlackRubyBot::MVC::Controller::Base
  def sayhello
    client.say(channel: data.channel, text: ""Received command #{match[:command]} with args #{match[:expression]}"")
  end
  alternate_name :sayhello, :alternate_way_to_call_hello
end
MyController.new(MyModel.new, MyView.new)
```
Note in the above example that the Controller instance method `sayhello` does not receive any arguments. When the instance method is called, the Controller class sets up some accessor methods to provide the normal `client`, `data`, and `match` objects. These are the same objects passed to the `command` block.

However, the Controller anticipates that the model and view objects should contain business logic that will also operate on the `client`, `data`, and `match` objects. The controller provides access to the model and view via the `model` and `view` accessor methods. The [inventory example](examples/inventory/inventorybot.rb) provides a full example of a Model, View, and Controller working together.

A Controller may need helper methods for certain work. To prevent the helper method from creating a route that the bot will respond to directly, the instance method name should begin with an underscore (e.g. `_my_helper_method`). When building the bot routes, these methods will be skipped.

Calling `alternate_name` after the method definition allows for method aliases similar to the regular `command` structure. When commands can be triggered by multiple text strings it's useful to have that ability map to the controller methods too.

Lastly, the Controller class includes `ActiveSupport::Callbacks` which allows for full flexibility in creating `before`, `after`, and `around` hooks for all methods. Again, see the [inventory example](examples/inventory/inventorybot.rb) for more information.

#### Model

A complex bot may need to read or write data from a database or other network resource. Setting up and tearing down these connections can be costly, so the model can do it once upon instantiation.

The Model also includes `ActiveSupport::Callbacks`.

```ruby
class MyModel < SlackRubyBot::MVC::Model::Base
  define_callbacks :sanitize
  set_callback :sanitize, :around, :sanitize_resource
  attr_accessor :_resource

  def initialize
    @db = setup_database_connection
  end

  def read(resource)
    self._resource = resource
    run_callbacks :sanitize do
      @db.select(:column1 => resource)
      # ... do some expensive work
    end
  end

  private

  def sanitize_resource
    self._resource.downcase
    result = yield
    puts ""After read, result is #{result.inspect}""
  end
end
```

Like Controllers, the Model is automatically loaded with the latest version of the `client`, `data`, and `match` objects each time the controller method is called. Therefore the model will always have access to the latest objects when doing its work. It will typically only use the `data` and `match` objects.

Model methods are not matched to routes, so there is no restriction on how to name methods as there is in Controllers.

#### View

A typical bot just writes to a channel or uses the web client to react/unreact to a message. More complex bots will probably require more complex behaviors. These should be stored in a `SlackRubyBot::MVC::View::Base` subclass.

```ruby
class MyView < SlackRubyBot::MVC::View::Base
  define_callbacks :logit
  set_callbacks :logit, :around, :audit_trail

  def initialize
    @mailer = setup_mailer
    @ftp = setup_ftp_handler
  end

  def email_admin(message)
    run_callbacks :logit do
      @mailer.send(:administrator, message)
    end
  end

  def react_thumbsup
    client.web_client.reactions_add(
      name: :thumbsup,
      channel: data.channel,
      timestamp: data.ts,
      as_user: true)
  end

  def react_thumbsdown
    client.web_client.reactions_remove(
      name: :thumbsup,
      channel: data.channel,
      timestamp: data.ts,
      as_user: true)
  end

  private

  def audit_trail
    Logger.audit(""Sending email at [#{Time.now}]"")
    yield
    Logger.audit(""Email sent by [#{Time.now}]"")
  end
end
```
Again, the View will have access to the most up to date `client`, `data`, and `match` objects. It will typically only use the `client` and `data` objects.

View methods are not matched to routes, so there is no restriction on how to name methods as there is in Controllers.

### Testing

#### RSpec Shared Behaviors

Slack-ruby-bot comes with a number of shared RSpec behaviors that can be used in your RSpec tests.

* [behaves like a slack bot](lib/slack-ruby-bot/rspec/support/slack-ruby-bot/it_behaves_like_a_slack_bot.rb): A bot quacks like a Slack Ruby bot.
* [respond with slack message](lib/slack-ruby-bot/rspec/support/slack-ruby-bot/respond_with_slack_message.rb): The bot responds with a message.
* [respond with slack messages](lib/slack-ruby-bot/rspec/support/slack-ruby-bot/respond_with_slack_messages.rb): The bot responds with a multiple messages.
* [respond with error](lib/slack-ruby-bot/rspec/support/slack-ruby-bot/respond_with_error.rb): An exception is raised inside a bot command.
* [start typing](lib/slack-ruby-bot/rspec/support/slack-ruby-bot/start_typing.rb): The bot calls `client.start_typing`.

Require `slack-ruby-bot/rspec` in your `spec_helper.rb` along with the following dependencies in Gemfile.

```ruby
group :development, :test do
  gem 'rack-test'
  gem 'rspec'
  gem 'vcr'
  gem 'webmock'
end
```

Use the `respond_with_slack_message` matcher.

```ruby
describe SlackRubyBot::Commands do
  it 'responds with any message' do
    expect(message: ""#{SlackRubyBot.config.user} hi"").to respond_with_slack_message
  end
  it 'says hi' do
    expect(message: ""#{SlackRubyBot.config.user} hi"").to respond_with_slack_message('hi')
  end
end
```

Use the `respond_with_slack_messages` matcher for multiple messages.

```ruby
describe SlackRubyBot::Commands do
  it 'responds with more than one message' do
    expect(message: ""#{SlackRubyBot.config.user} count"").to respond_with_slack_messages
  end
  it 'says one and two' do
    expect(message: ""#{SlackRubyBot.config.user} count"").to respond_with_slack_messages(['one', 'two'])
  end
end
```

Message matchers support regular expressions.

```ruby
describe SlackRubyBot::Commands do
  it 'says hi' do
    expect(message: ""#{SlackRubyBot.config.user} hi"").to respond_with_slack_message(/hi/)
  end
end
```

Check that the bot called `client.start_typing(channel: 'channel')`.

```ruby
describe SlackRubyBot::Commands do
 it 'starts typing on channel' do
    expect(message: ""#{SlackRubyBot.config.user} hi"").to start_typing(channel: 'channel')
  end
end
```

#### Testing Lower Level Messages

You can test client behavior at a lower level by fetching the message hook. The following example expects a bot command to call `client.typing(channel: data.channel)`.

```ruby
describe SlackRubyBot::Commands do
  let(:app) { Server.new }
  let(:client) { app.send(:client) }
  let(:message_hook) { SlackRubyBot::Hooks::Message.new }
  it 'receives a typing event' do
      expect(client).to receive(:typing)
      message_hook.call(
        client,
        Hashie::Mash.new(text: ""#{SlackRubyBot.config.user} type something"", channel: 'channel')
      )
    end
  end
end
```

283,283,LittleFriendsGroup/BottomNavigation,,"# 底部导航栏（Bottom navigation）规范指南

###前言：
最近 Google 在Material Design设计规范中加入底部导航栏（Bottom navigation）设计,对此，我会在文末给出个人看法！现在我们先来学习Bottom navigation
 在设计、使用、交互、风格、尺寸的一些规范。水平有限，如理解有误，请多多吐槽。
 
 ![](https://material-design.storage.googleapis.com/publish/material_v_4/material_ext_publish/0B3321sZLoP_HUW9qLXpZTDhhS1U/components_bottomnavigation_spec_elevation3.png)
 
###简单介绍
底部导航栏（Bottom navigation）这种设计在很多 Android App 中都是随处可见的，如支付宝、微信、QQ等都使用了，它允许用户可以在多个顶级视图之间快速切换。

###如何使用
（1）底部导航栏需要有3-5个标签（tab）,并且每个tab选择的视图重要性要相似，对于少于3个tab的情况，是不推荐使用Bottom navigation的。

正确方式：

 <img src=""https://material-design.storage.googleapis.com/publish/material_v_4/material_ext_publish/0B3321sZLoP_HajN5eDd2UUtGT00/components_bottomnavigation_usage3.png"" width=""360"" height=""300"" />
 
 错误方式：
 
 <img src=""https://material-design.storage.googleapis.com/publish/material_v_4/material_ext_publish/0B3321sZLoP_HYkp0Z1g0dHJXQ3c/components_bottomnavigation_usage4.png"" width=""360"" height=""300"" />
 
 （2）如果标签很多，比如有超过了5个这种情况呢？Google也是不提倡使用Bottom navigation的，可以用Drawer navigation替换。
 
 正确方式：
 
 
 <img src=""https://material-design.storage.googleapis.com/publish/material_v_4/material_ext_publish/0B3321sZLoP_HZHA1UVAyRFpMVDQ/components_bottomnavigation_usage5.png"" width=""360"" height=""300"" />
 
  错误方式：
 
  <img src=""https://material-design.storage.googleapis.com/publish/material_v_4/material_ext_publish/0B3321sZLoP_HbjhLajFZd0JZbmM/components_bottomnavigation_usage6.png"" width=""360"" height=""300"" />
  
###风格样式
（1）标签Icons和文字的颜色选择是很重要的，一亮一暗才能有对比，用户才很快知道你选择了哪个，如果五颜六色，你是很难分清选择了哪个的。

正确方式：

 <img src=""https://material-design.storage.googleapis.com/publish/material_v_4/material_ext_publish/0B3321sZLoP_HSGh1M0QzNVJvVnM/components_bottomnavigation_style5.png"" width=""360"" height=""300"" />
 
 错误方式：
 
  <img src=""https://material-design.storage.googleapis.com/publish/material_v_4/material_ext_publish/0B3321sZLoP_HdF81WTZGYXNFQXc/components_bottomnavigation_style6.png"" width=""360"" height=""300"" />
 
 
  
（2）标签的文字说明要简短而有意义，避免太长的，也不提倡太长了换行和省略的方式

正确方式：

 <img src=""https://material-design.storage.googleapis.com/publish/material_v_4/material_ext_publish/0B3321sZLoP_HUy13a2EtMnVFN1E/components_bottomnavigation_style1.png"" width=""360"" height=""300"" />
 
错误方式：
 
  <img src=""https://material-design.storage.googleapis.com/publish/material_v_4/material_ext_publish/0B3321sZLoP_HTmdoVlhRUlpBTFU/components_bottomnavigation_style2.png"" width=""360"" height=""300"" />
   <img src=""https://material-design.storage.googleapis.com/publish/material_v_4/material_ext_publish/0B3321sZLoP_HQllNTmFqX1czY2s/components_bottomnavigation_style3.png"" width=""360"" height=""300"" />
    <img src=""https://material-design.storage.googleapis.com/publish/material_v_4/material_ext_publish/0B3321sZLoP_HNWZBUGhvWVpmS2M/components_bottomnavigation_style4.png"" width=""360"" height=""300"" />
    

####注意：
* 1. 选中的标签要展示高亮图标和文字
* 2. 如果是3个标签的时候，要展示Bottom navigation bar中所有的图标和文字
* 3. 如果是多于3个标签的情况，没选中的tab只需要展示图标就可以，不用文字说明

    
###行为交互
（1）用户上拉列表时，隐藏Bottom navigation，下拉列表时，显示Bottom navigation

![](http://ww4.sinaimg.cn/mw690/7ef01fcajw1f1zw7j8vbyg209w0hmu0y.gif)

(2)点击Bottom navigation Icon 的时候，不能打开菜单选择或者其他弹窗操作，而只是刷新当前视图的内容，如下图：

![](http://ww3.sinaimg.cn/mw690/7ef01fcajw1f1zwkyevefg209w0hm4gx.gif)

(3)不推荐使用手势在视图内容区域切换视图

正确方式：

![](http://ww4.sinaimg.cn/mw690/7ef01fcagw1f1zwwyi12mg209y0hmx5p.gif)

错误方式：

![](http://ww1.sinaimg.cn/mw690/7ef01fcagw1f1zwz18jkkg209y0hmx6p.gif)

###尺寸设计
（1）Bottom navigation对于尺寸的要求还是挺严格的，标签选中和没选中都有细微的差别。

![](https://material-design.storage.googleapis.com/publish/material_v_4/material_ext_publish/0B3321sZLoP_HcV9maGFKNVN1STQ/components_bottomnavigation_spec_fixed1.png)

效果如下：

![](http://ww3.sinaimg.cn/mw690/7ef01fcajw1f1zxp58q1pg209w08kwfo.gif)

对手机app来说已经足够了，如果你想了解更多，可以去官网看看更多详情：https://www.google.com/design/spec/components/bottom-navigation.html#bottom-navigation-specs


###杂谈
Android官网中有这么一句话：

[Don't use bottom tab bars](http://developer.android.com/design/patterns/pure-android.html)

Other platforms use the bottom tab bar to switch between the app's views. Per platform convention, Android's tabs for view control are shown in action bars at the top of the screen instead. In addition, Android apps may use a bottom bar to display actions on a split action bar.

You should follow this guideline to create a consistent experience with other apps on the Android platform and to avoid confusion between actions and view switching on Android.

![](https://pic3.zhimg.com/01e0c2e21118df79507b4797bda71dee_b.png)

虽然我英语烂，但也不至于看不懂什么意思吧，之前说好的Meterial Design 规范说变就变，自己都不遵守，有何规范可言。

然而，我是理智的，Google + 和 Google Photos 都加入了底部导航栏（Bottom navigation），打脸归打脸，决定这一因素的还是用户。

我们说说Drawer navigation，不要觉得疑惑，关Drawer什么事？没错，就是和它有关，认真想想，使用Drawer切换视图时，使用方式是点击按钮或者手势滑动打开，然后才选择跳转的Item，虽然节省了手机视图空间，但是操作较不方便以致使用率低，从而降低其他页面的跳转率这个缺点是不能忽视的。
所以说，相对于Drawer navigation,Bottom navigation就有优势了。

然后，对于我们开发来说，又是一大难点了

比如FB、SnackBar等显示的方式，个人觉得都可以不需要FB了，至于SnackBar，看下图：

![](https://material-design.storage.googleapis.com/publish/material_v_4/material_ext_publish/0B3321sZLoP_HQTdycnRmdXlFbEk/components_bottomnavigation_spec_elevation1.png)

原谅我欣赏不了这种美。

# SuperScript

SuperScript is a dialog system and bot engine for creating human-like conversation chat bots. It exposes an expressive script for crafting dialogue and features text-expansion using WordNet and information retrieval using a fact system built on a [Level](https://github.com/Level/level) interface.

Note: This version (v1.x) is designed to work with and tested against the latest Node 6.x and above.

## Why SuperScript?

SuperScript's power comes in its topics and conversations, which mimic typical human conversations. If you're looking to create complex conversations with branching dialogue, or recreate the natural flow of talking about different topics, SuperScript is for you!

## What comes in the box

* Dialog engine.
* Multi-user platform for easy integration with group chat systems like Slack.
* Message pipeline with NLP tech such as POS tagging, sentence analysis and question tagging.
* Extensible plugin architecture to call your own APIs or do your own NLP if you want to!
* A built in graph database using LevelDB. Each user has their own sub-level, allowing you to define complex relationships between entities.
* [WordNet](http://wordnet.princeton.edu/), a database for word and concept expansion.

## Install

    npm install superscript

## Getting Started

### bot-init

If you've installed superscript globally (`npm install -g superscript`), a good way to get your new bot up and running is by running the `bot-init` script:

    bot-init myBotName --clients telnet,slack

This will create a bot in a new 'myBotName' folder in your current directory. You can specify the clients you want with the `--clients` flag.

Then all you need to do is run:

```
cd myBotName
npm install
parse
npm run build
npm run start-[clientName]
```

This will start the server. You then need to connect to a client to be able to talk to your bot! If you're using the telnet client, you'll need to open up a new Terminal tab, and run `telnet localhost 2000`.

Note: The `parse` step is a bin script that will compile your SuperScript script. By default, it will look at the `chat` folder in your current directory.

### Clone a template

Alternatively, check out the [`hello-superscript`](https://github.com/silentrob/hello-superscript) repo for a clean starting point to building your own bot. There's no guarantee at present that this is using the latest version of SuperScript.

### Using Heroku's one-click deploy

Thanks to @bmann we now have a one-click deploy to Heroku! More info can be found over at [superscript-heroku](https://github.com/bmann/superscript-heroku).

#### Express Client

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/bmann/superscript-heroku/tree/master)

#### Slack Client

The slack-client branch creates a superscript powered bot that sits in your Slack. You'll need to create a bot and give it a name in the [Slack apps directory](http://my.slack.com/apps/A0F7YS25R-bots) in order to get a token that lets your bot connect to your Slack.

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/bmann/superscript-heroku/tree/slack-client)

Creating the bot in the Slack directory means you'll see the bot appear in your Slack as offline. When your server from above is running correctly, the status of the bot will go green, and you can say ""Hi"" to it and it will respond.

## Upgrading to v1.x

Information on upgrading to v1.x can be found [on the wiki](https://github.com/superscriptjs/superscript/wiki/Upgrading-to-v1).

### Example Script - Script Authoring

    + hello human
    - Hello Bot

`+` matches all input types

`-` Is the reply sent back to the user.


### Optional and Alternates - Script Authoring

    + [hey] hello (nice|mean) human
    - Hello Bot

`[]` are for optional words, they may or may not appear in the input match

`()` are alternate words. One MUST appear.

### Capturing results - Script Authoring (wildcards)

    + * should *~2 work *1
    - I have no idea.

`*` Matches ZERO or more words or tokens

`*~n` Matches ZERO to N words or tokens

`*n` Matches exactly N number of words or tokens


## And More

The above is just a tiny fraction of what the system is capable of doing. Please see the [full documentation](http://superscriptjs.com) to learn more.

> A powerful dependency injection micro container

## Introduction

BottleJS is a tiny, powerful dependency injection container.  It features lazy loading, middleware hooks, decorators and a clean api inspired by the [AngularJS Module API](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/type/angular.Module) and the simple PHP library [Pimple](http://pimple.sensiolabs.org/).  You'll like BottleJS if you enjoy:

* building a stack from components rather than a kitchen-sink framework.
* uncoupled objects and dependency injection.
* an API that makes sense.
* lazily loaded objects.
* trying cool stuff :smile:

## Browser Support

BottleJS supports IE9+ and other ECMAScript 5 compliant browsers.

## Installation

BottleJS can be used in a browser or in a nodejs app.  It can be installed via bower or npm:

```bash
$ bower install bottlejs
```

```bash
$ npm install bottlejs
```

BottleJS is also available on cdnjs:

```html
<script src=""https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/bottlejs/1.7.1/bottle.min.js""></script>
```

## Simple Example

The simplest recipe to get started with is `Bottle#service`.  Say you have a constructor for a service object:

```js
var Beer = function() { /* A beer service, :yum: */ };
```

You can register the constructor with `Bottle#service`:

```js
var bottle = new Bottle();
bottle.service('Beer', Beer);
```

Later, when you need the constructed service, you just access the `Beer` property like this:

```js
bottle.container.Beer;
```

A lot happened behind the scenes:

1. Bottle created a provider containing a factory function when you registered the Beer service.
2. When the `bottle.container.Beer` property was accessed, Bottle looked up the provider and executed the factory to build and return the Beer service.
3. The provider and factory were deleted, and the `bottle.container.Beer` property was set to be the Beer service instance.  Accessing `bottle.container.Beer` in the future becomes a simple property lookup.

## Injecting Dependencies

The above example is simple.  But, what if the Beer service had dependencies?  For example:

```js
var Barley = function() {};
var Hops = function() {};
var Water = function() {};
var Beer = function(barley, hops, water) { /* A beer service, :yum: */ };
```

You can register services with `Bottle#service` and include dependencies like this:

```js
var bottle = new Bottle();
bottle.service('Barley', Barley);
bottle.service('Hops', Hops);
bottle.service('Water', Water);
bottle.service('Beer', Beer, 'Barley', 'Hops', 'Water');
```

Now, when you access `bottle.container.Beer`, Bottle will lazily load all of the dependencies and inject them into your Beer service before returning it.

### Service Factory

If you need more complex logic when generating a service, you can register a factory instead.  A factory function receives the container as an argument, and should return your constructed service:

```js
var bottle = new Bottle();
bottle.service('Barley', Barley);
bottle.service('Hops', Hops);
bottle.service('Water', Water);
bottle.factory('Beer', function(container) {
    var barley = container.Barley;
    var hops = container.Hops;
    var water = container.Water;

    barley.halved();
    hops.doubled();
    water.spring();
    return new Beer(barley, hops, water);
});
```

### Service Provider

This is the meat of the Bottle library.  The above methods `Bottle#service` and `Bottle#factory` are just shorthand for the provider function.  You usually can get by with the simple functions above, but if you really need more granular control of your services in different environments, register them as a provider.  To use it, pass a constructor for the provider that exposes a `$get` function.  The `$get` function is used as a factory to build your service.

```js
var bottle = new Bottle();
bottle.service('Barley', Barley);
bottle.service('Hops', Hops);
bottle.service('Water', Water);
bottle.provider('Beer', function() {
    // This environment may not support water.
    // We should polyfill it.
    if (waterNotSupported) {
        Beer.polyfillWater();
    }

    // this is the service factory.
    this.$get = function(container) {
        var barley = container.Barley;
        var hops = container.Hops;
        var water = container.Water;

        barley.halved();
        hops.doubled();
        water.spring();
        return new Beer(barley, hops, water);
    };
});
```

## Decorators

Bottle supports injecting decorators into the provider pipeline with the `Bottle#decorator` method.  Bottle decorators are just simple functions that intercept a service in the provider phase after it has been created, but before it is accessed for the first time.  The function should return the service, or another object to be used as the service instead.

```js
var bottle = new Bottle();
bottle.service('Beer', Beer);
bottle.service('Wine', Wine);
bottle.decorator(function(service) {
    // this decorator will be run for both Beer and Wine services.
    service.stayCold();
    return service;
});

bottle.decorator('Wine', function(wine) {
    // this decorator will only affect the Wine service.
    wine.unCork();
    return wine;
});
```

## Middleware

Bottle middleware are similar to decorators, but they are executed every time a service is accessed from the container.  They are passed the service instance and a `next` function:

```js
var bottle = new Bottle();
bottle.service('Beer', Beer);
bottle.middleware(function(service, next) {
    // this middleware will be executed for all services
    console.log('A service was accessed!');
    next();
});

bottle.middleware('Beer', function(beer, next) {
    // this middleware will only affect the Beer service.
    console.log('Beer?  Nice.  Tip your bartender...');
    next();
});
```

Middleware can pass an error object to the `next` function, and bottle will throw the error:

```js
var bottle = new Bottle();
bottle.service('Beer', Beer);
bottle.middleware('Beer', function(beer, next) {
    if (beer.hasGoneBad()) {
        return next(new Error('The Beer has gone bad!'));
    }
    next();
});

// results in Uncaught Error: The Beer has gone bad!(…)
```

## Nested Bottles
Bottle will generate nested containers if dot notation is used in the service name.  An isolated sub container will be created for you based on the name given:

```js
var bottle = new Bottle();
var IPA = function() {};
bottle.service('Beer.IPA', IPA);
bottle.container.Beer; // this is a new Bottle.container object
bottle.container.Beer.IPA; // the service
bottle.factory('Beer.DoubleIPA', function (container) {
    var IPA = container.IPA; // note the container in here is the nearest parent.
})
```

### Nested Containers Are Isolated
Nested containers are designed to provide isolation between different packages.  This means that you cannot access a nested container from a different parent when you are writing a factory.

```js
var bottle = new Bottle();
var IPA = function() {};
var Wort = function() {};
bottle.service('Ingredients.Wort', Wort);
bottle.factory('Beer.IPA', function(container) {
    // container is `Beer`, not the root, so:
    container.Wort; // undefined
    container.Ingredients.Wort; // undefined
});
```

## API

### Bottle

#### pop(name)

Used to get an instance of bottle.  If a name is passed, bottle will return the same instance.  Calling the Bottle constructor as a function will call and return `Bottle.pop`, so `Bottle.pop('Soda') === Bottle('Soda')`

Param                      | Type       | Details
:--------------------------|:-----------|:--------
**name**<br />*(optional)* | *String*   | The name of the bottle. If passed, bottle will store the instance internally and return the same instance if `Bottle.pop` is subsequently called with the same name.

#### clear(name)

Removes the named instance from bottle's internal store, if it exists. The immediately subsequent call to `Bottle.pop(name)` will return a new instance. If no name is given, all named instances will be cleared.

In general, this function should only be called in situations where you intend to reset the bottle instance with new providers, decorators, etc. such as test setup.

Param                      | Type       | Details
:--------------------------|:-----------|:--------
**name**<br />*(optional)* | *String*   | The name of the bottle. If passed, bottle will remove the internal instance, if such a bottle was created using `Bottle.pop`. If not passed, all named internal instances will be cleared.

#### list(container)
#### prototype.list()
#### prototype.container.$list()

Used to list the names of all registered constants, values, and services on the container.  Must pass a container to the global static version `Bottle.list(bottle.container)`.  The instance and container versions return the services that are registered within.

Returns an array of strings.

Param                           | Type       | Details
:-------------------------------|:-----------|:--------
**container**<br />*(optional)* | *Object*   | A `bottle.container`.  Only required when using the global, static `Bottle.list` method.  The prototype version uses that instance's container, and the container version uses itself.

#### config

A global configuration object.

Property   | Type      | Default | Details
:----------|:----------|:--------|:--------
**strict** | *Boolean* | `false` | Enables strict mode.  Currently only verifies that automatically injected dependencies are not undefined.

### Bottle.prototype

#### decorators

A collection of decorators registered by the bottle instance.  See `decorator(name, func)` below

#### middlewares

A collection of middleware registered by the bottle instance.  See `middleware(name, func)` below.

#### nested

A collection of nested bottles registered by the parent bottle instance when dot notation is used to define a service.  See ""Nested Bottles"" section in the documentation above.

#### providerMap

A collection of registered provider names.  Bottle uses this internally to determine whether a provider has already instantiated it's instance.  See `provider(name, Provider)` below.

#### deferred

An array of deferred functions registered for this bottle instance.  See `defer(func)` below.

#### constant(name, value)

Used to add a read only value to the container.

Param     | Type       | Details
:---------|:-----------|:--------
**name**  | *String*   | The name of the constant.  Must be unique to each Bottle instance.
**value** | *Mixed*    | A value that will be defined as enumerable, but not writable.

#### decorator(name, func)
#### container.$decorator(name, func)

Used to register a decorator function that the provider will use to modify your services at creation time. `bottle.container.$decorator` is an alias of `bottle.decorator`; this allows you to only add a decorator to a nested bottle.

Param                      | Type       | Details
:--------------------------|:-----------|:--------
**name**<br />*(optional)* | *String*   | The name of the service this decorator will affect. Will run for all services if not passed.
**func**                   | *Function* | A function that will accept the service as the first parameter.  Should return the service, or a new object to be used as the service.

#### defer(func)

Register a function to be executed when `Bottle#resolve` is called.

Param    | Type       | Details
:--------|:-----------|:--------
**func** | *Function* | A function to be called later.  Will be passed a value given to `Bottle#resolve`.

#### digest(services)

Immediately instantiate an array of services and return their instances
in the order of the array of instances.

Param        | Type    | Details
:------------|:--------|:--------
**services** | *Array* | Array of services that should be instantiated.

#### factory(name, Factory)

Used to register a service factory

Param       | Type       | Details
:-----------|:-----------|:--------
**name**    | *String*   | The name of the service.  Must be unique to each Bottle instance.
**Factory** | *Function* | A function that should return the service object.  Will only be called once; the Service will be a singleton.  Gets passed an instance of the container to allow dependency injection when creating the service.

#### instanceFactory(name, Factory)

Used to register a service instance factory that will return an instance when called.

Param       | Type       | Details
:-----------|:-----------|:--------
**name**    | *String*   | The name of the service.  Must be unique to each Bottle instance.
**Factory** | *Function* | A function that should return a fully configured service object. This factory function will be executed when a new instance is created. Gets passed an instance of the container.

```js
var bottle = new Bottle();
var Hefeweizen = function(container) { return { abv: Math.random() * (6 - 4) + 4 }};
bottle.instanceFactory('Beer.Hefeweizen', Hefeweizen);

var hefeFactory = bottle.container.Beer.Hefeweizen; // This is an instance factory with a single `instance` method

var beer1 = hefeFactory.instance(); // Calls factory function to create a new instance
var beer2 = hefeFactory.instance(); // Calls factory function to create a second new instance

beer1 !== beer2 // true
```

This pattern is especially useful for request based context objects that store state or things like database connections.  See the documentation for Google Guice's [InjectingProviders](https://github.com/google/guice/wiki/InjectingProviders) for more examples.

#### middleware(name, func)

Used to register a middleware function.  This function will be executed every time the service is accessed.

Param                      | Type       | Details
:--------------------------|:-----------|:--------
**name**<br />*(optional)* | *String*   | The name of the service for which this middleware will be called. Will run for all services if not passed.
**func**                   | *Function* | A function that will accept the service as the first parameter, and a `next` function as the second parameter.  Should execute `next()` to allow other middleware in the stack to execute.  Bottle will throw anything passed to the `next` function, i.e. `next(new Error('error msg'))`.

#### provider(name, Provider)

Used to register a service provider

Param        | Type       | Details
:------------|:-----------|:--------
**name**     | *String*   | The name of the service.  Must be unique to each Bottle instance.
**Provider** | *Function* | A constructor function that will be instantiated as a singleton.  Should expose a function called `$get` that will be used as a factory to instantiate the service.

#### resetProviders(names)
Param                      | Type       | Details
:--------------------------|:-----------|:--------
**names**<br />*(optional)*| *Array*    | An array of strings which contains names of the providers to be reset.

Used to reset providers for the next reference to re-instantiate the provider. If `names` param is passed, will reset only the named providers.

#### register(Obj)
#### container.$register(Obj)

Used to register a service, factory, provider, or value based on properties of the Obj.  `bottle.container.$register` is an alias of `bottle.register`; this allows factories and providers to register multiple services on the container without needing access to the bottle instance itself.

If `Bottle.config.strict` is set to `true`, this method will throw an error if an injected dependency is `undefined`.

Param   | Type       | Details
:-------|:-----------|:--------
**Obj** | *Object*\|*Function* | An object or constructor with one of several properties:<br /><ul><li>**Obj.$name** &mdash; *required* &mdash; the name used to register the object</li><li>**Obj.$type** &mdash; *optional* &mdash; the method used to register the object.  Defaults to `'service'` in which case the Obj will be treated as a constructor. Valid types are: `'service'`, `'factory'`, `'provider'`, `'value'`</li><li>**Obj.$inject** &mdash; *optional* &mdash; If `Obj.$type` is `'service'`, this property can be a string name or an array of names of dependencies to inject into the constructor.<br />E.g. `Obj.$inject = ['dep1', 'dep2'];`</li><li>**Obj.$value** &mdash; *optional* &mdash; Normally Obj is registered on the container.  However, if this property is included, it's value will be registered on the container instead of the object itself.  Useful for registering objects on the bottle container without modifying those objects with bottle specific keys.</li></ul>

#### resolve(data)

Execute any deferred functions registered by `Bottle#defer`.

Param                      | Type    | Details
:--------------------------|:--------|:--------
**data**<br />*(optional)* | *Mixed* | Value to be passed to each deferred function as the first parameter.

#### service(name, Constructor [, dependency [, ...]])

Used to register a service constructor.  If `Bottle.config.strict` is set to `true`, this method will throw an error if an injected dependency is `undefined`.

Param                            | Type       | Details
:--------------------------------|:-----------|:--------
**name**                         | *String*   | The name of the service.  Must be unique to each Bottle instance.
**Constructor**                  | *Function* | A constructor function that will be instantiated as a singleton.
**dependency**<br />*(optional)* | *String*   | An optional name for a dependency to be passed to the constructor.  A dependency will be passed to the constructor for each name passed to `Bottle#service` in the order they are listed.

#### serviceFactory(name, factoryService [, dependency [, ...]])

Used to register a service factory function. Works exactly like `factory` except the factory arguments will be injected instead of receiving the `container`. This is useful when implementing the Module Pattern or adding dependencies to your Higher Order Functions.

```js
function packageKeg(Barrel, Beer, Love) {
    Barrel.add(Beer, Love);
    return {
        tap : function() {
            return Barrel.dispense();
        }
    };
}
bottle.serviceFactory('Keg', packageKeg, 'Barrel', 'Beer', 'Love');
```

If `Bottle.config.strict` is set to `true`, this method will throw an error if an injected dependency is `undefined`.

Param                            | Type       | Details
:--------------------------------|:-----------|:--------
**name**                         | *String*   | The name of the service.  Must be unique to each Bottle instance.
**serviceFactory**               | *Function* | A function that will be invoked to create the service object/value.
**dependency**<br />*(optional)* | *String*   | An optional name for a dependency to be passed to the service function.  A dependency will be passed to the service function for each name passed to `Bottle#serviceFactory` in the order they are listed.

#### value(name, val)

Used to add an arbitrary value to the container.

Param    | Type     | Details
:--------|:---------|:--------
**name** | *String* | The name of the value.  Must be unique to each Bottle instance.
**val**  | *Mixed*  | A value that will be defined as enumerable, but not writable.

    // more information about additional params https://api.slack.com/methods/chat.postMessage
    var params = {
        icon_emoji: ':cat:'
    };
    
    // define channel, where bot exist. You can adjust it there https://my.slack.com/services 
    bot.postMessageToChannel('general', 'meow!', params);
    
    // define existing username instead of 'user_name'
    bot.postMessageToUser('user_name', 'meow!', params); 
    
    // If you add a 'slackbot' property, 
    // you will post to another user's slackbot channel instead of a direct message
    bot.postMessageToUser('user_name', 'meow!', { 'slackbot': true, icon_emoji: ':cat:' }); 
    
    // define private group instead of 'private_group', where bot exist
    bot.postMessageToGroup('private_group', 'meow!', params); 
});
```
PROFIT!

```js
/**
 * @param {object} data
 */
bot.on('message', function(data) {
    // all ingoing events https://api.slack.com/rtm
    console.log(data);
});
```

### Response Handler

The simplest way for handling response is callback function, which is specified as a last argument:
```js
bot.postMessageToUser('user1', 'hi', function(data) {/* ... */});
bot.postMessageToUser('user1', 'hi', params, function(data) {/* ... */});
```

But also you can use promises.

Error:
```js
bot.postMessageToUser('user1', 'hi').fail(function(data) {
    //data = { ok: false, error: 'user_not_found' }
})
```
Success:
```js
bot.postMessageToUser('user', 'hi').then(function(data) {
    // ...
})
```
Error and Success:
```js
bot.postMessageToUser('user', 'hi').always(function(data) {
    // ...
})
```

292,292,aws-samples/aws-lex-web-ui,JavaScript,"# Transfer to Amazon Connect Live Chat

This feature allows users of the Lex Web UI to have conversations with an Amazon Connect Live Agent. When the user
requests a transfer, all subsequent messages are sent to Connect Live Chat Agent and responses from the Agent are 
displayed back to the user as a message bubble. The conversation continues between user and agent until
either party disconnects. Once disconnected, messages are again sent to the Lex bot.

## Setup

### Configure a Connect Instance

The following procedure configures a Connect contact flow to use for live chat. In this example, the Sample inbound
contact flow is used to handle the incoming live chat. In practice, a new inbound flow should be developed as well as a 
disconnect flow that displays a message once the session is terminated. 

1. Set up a [Connect Instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/amazon-connect-instances.html)
2. Once you login to your instance, select **Routing** then **Contact flows**
![connect contact flows](./img/connect-contact-flows.png)
3. Find **Sample inbound flow (first contact experience)** from the list
4. Expand **Show additional flow information** and take note of the Contact Flow ID (in blue below) and Instance ID (in red).
You are going to need to pass these values during the creation of the CloudFormation stacks below
![connect flow details](./img/connect-flow-details.png)
5. If desired, [Enable Attachments]([https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/enable-attachments.html]) 
to attach the bot transcript as a file for the agent to review. You will also have to set the ConnectAttachChatTranscript 
CloudFormation parameter to true. When configuring CORS for the S3 bucket used for attachments, you should use the CloudFront distribution domain name (for example, 
d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net) that is deployed with this Lex-Web-UI stack, unless you are providing a CNAME 
custom URL in front of it, in which case you should use the CNAME. In addition, the origin of the ""Connect Contact
Control Panel"" should also be included in the CORS definition. In sample below, 
replace ""https://connectinstance.my.connect.aws"" with the origin of your ""Connect Contact Control Panel"". If using
the default Contact Control Panel this will be the same as the origin of the ""Connect Login"" URL. 
In the example replace ""https://d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net"" with the origin of your ""lex-web-ui"" distribution as noted earlier.
```
[
    {
        ""AllowedHeaders"": [
            ""*""
        ],
        ""AllowedMethods"": [
            ""PUT"",
            ""GET""
        ],
        ""AllowedOrigins"": [
            ""https://connectinstance.my.connect.aws"",
            ""https://d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net""
        ],
        ""ExposeHeaders"": []
    }
]
```

## Deploy or update the Lex Web UI Stack

### Using the standard distribution template (master.yaml)

Deploy a new Lex Web UI or update an existing Lex Web UI from the standard deployment repos. 

For a new stack, fill in the required values just as you would for any Lex Web Ui deployment.

At the end of the parameter list, you will notice new parameters that control enabling the Connect Live Chat feature.

1. Set ShouldEnableLiveChat to true
2. Add additional ConnectLiveChatTerms as a comma separated list if terms other than 'live chat' should be supported
3. Fill in ConnectInstanceId
4. Fill in ConnectContactFlowId
5. Change the ConnectPromptForNameMessage if desired
6. Change the ConnectWaitForAgentMessage if desired
7. Change the wait message interval, ConnectWaitForAgentMessageIntervalInSeconds, from 60 seconds to some other value if desired. 
8. Change the ConnectAgentJoinedMessage if desired. {Agent} will be replaced by the agent's name.
9. Change the ConnectAgentLeftMessage if desired. {Agent} will be replaced by the agent's name.
10. Change the ConnectChatEndedMessage if desired
11. Change ConnectAttachChatTranscript to true if you would like to also attach the chat transcript as a file. This will also require enabling chat attachments in the Amazon Connect instance, as noted above in the Configure a Connect Instance section of this document.

THe last two properties adjust the message displayed while the user is waiting for an agent and frequency of this
message. You can also control this type behavior from the contact flow. If using the contact flow to display wait
messages to the user, set the ConnectWaitForAgentMessageIntervalInSeconds to 0.

Once you have the parameters set, Create or update your stack.

### Using the pipeline template

The pipeline templates setup a new pipeline and code commit repo which deploys LexWebUi. The master-pipeline.yaml
template can be used to create a new pipeline and kick off execution of the pipeline. For a new pipeline, the same
parameters described above can be specified. When complete, the newly deployed Lex Web Ui
will have an updated lex-web-ui-loader-config.json file containing all the values specified for Connect Live Chat. 
Future modifications to connect live chat parameters should occur in the lex-web-ui-loader-config.json file and 
then be committed to code commit repo for deployment.

The new parameters configurable in lex-web-ui-loader-config.json are shown below. 

```
  ""connect"": {
    ""contactFlowId"" : ""YOUR CONTACT FLOW ID"",
    ""instanceId"" : ""YOUR CONNECT INSTANCE ID"",
    ""apiGatewayEndpoint"" : ""Your newly created Amazon API Gateway endpoint"",
    ""promptForNameMessage"": ""Before starting a live chat, please tell me your name?"",
    ""waitingForAgentMessage"": ""Thanks for waiting. An agent will be with you when available."",
    ""waitingForAgentMessageIntervalSeconds"": 60,
    ""agentJoinedMessage"": ""{Agent} has joined."",
    ""agentLeftMessage"": ""{Agent} has left."", 
    ""chatEndedMessage"": ""Chat ended."",
    ""attachChatTranscript"": true
  },
```

## Usage

Once the stack creation has completed, you can open the parent page hosting the Lex Web UI on your browser.

On a separate browser window or tab, sign in as an agent on 
the [Amazon Connect Contact Control Panel (CCP)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/agent-user-guide.html) 
to receive the live agent contacts originated from the Lex Web UI.

Back on the Lex Web UI parent page, select the **menu** button on the Lex Web UI toolbar 
and then the **live chat** button to start a chat session with the agent. At this point 
the user and agent should be able to interact with each other. Users can also invoke the live chat feature using
""live chat"" for text input. 

To disconnect from Live Chat, click the hangup button next to text input or use the menu to ""Stop Live Chat"". 

## Connect Disconnect Flow logic

The LexWebUi observes messages from Connect to present responses to the user. It monitors for a specific message
to disconnect the user. This message is 'application/vnd.amazonaws.connect.event.chat.ended'. When this message is
received, the LexWebUi will terminate the live agent chat and resume normal operation chatting with the configured
Lex Bot. 

Connect sends this message when the ""Disconnect"" block is executed in a contact flow.

In Connect's ""Sample disconnect flow"", ""Disconnect"" is used after waiting for 15 minutes. While waiting, the LexWebUi
will continue to send messages to Connect Live Chat rather then sending messages to the Lex Bot.

If you desire to terminate Live Chat in LexWebUi as soon as the Agent terminates the chat in the CCP, configure the 
flow performing the disconnect to terminate immediately as in the following modified ""Sample disconnect flow"".

# Create your own auto direct message Twitter Bot 💬💬


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*yAlQxm27HPR2qjRcqizY2w.png)


Create a welcome message for your new followers in twitter is the first step to get more people engage with your tweets and links, As you know there is a lot of online services that help you send auto direct message to your new followers but I think it’s crazy how online services charge between $5 to $15 for a simple tool that creates bots when you can build your own.

In this article, I will introduce my own Twitter bot that I built to send a welcome message to my new followers on Twitter and how it works for me very fine for 6 months.

By the end of this article, you can build your own twitter auto DM for free !! from creating your message to deploy the bot.

### What do you need?

To develop this bot we need:

-   Node js installed
-   [Twit](https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fttezel%2Ftwit) : Twitter API Client for node (REST & Streaming API)
-   [Github Account](https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2F)
-   [Twitter Account](https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2F)
-   [Heroku Account](https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.heroku.com%2F) to deploy the bot.

If you are not familiar with Nodejs. or maybe you are not a programmer, you can fork the project from GitHub and use it as your own.

> Let’s get started.

----------

### Create your Own Twitter Bot 🛠🛠

#### Step 1: Github.

-   Show you support by a simple star 
-   Fork the project repo in Github

-   Now, Customize your welcome message by updating the  `GenerateMessage`function and Commit your change.

#### Step 2 : Twitter

Create a Twitter app: Go to  [https://apps.twitter.com/](https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapps.twitter.com%2F)  and click to the button  `Create New App`, then complete all the fields as the following:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*Gr9ggwyDcJgSnK-T8U3_JQ.png)

Go to the  `Permissions`  section and give the app the access to send Direct messages by checking the option “Read, Write and Access direct messages”.

  

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*m8qV-_h0eK4yMSofD0qINQ.png)

Go to tab `key and Access Tokens` then click the `Generate Access Token` button at the bottom of the page.

Now copy all your keys  `Consumer Key`,  `Consumer Secret` ,  `Acess Token`A and  `Acess Token Secret`, because we need to add all of them later as Heroku vars.

#### Step 3: Heroku

-   Create a  [Heroku account](https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdashboard.heroku.com%2F). it is free!
-   Connect to your Heroku account and create a new app by clicking the  `New`button, then the  `Create new App`  option.
-   Choose your app name then click  `Create App`

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*J7tbxXiRzeOZTlyzIvYxOg.png)

Choose Github as the Deployment method then click the connect button

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*QETgzVnscTLIxuD9XFEV5g.png)

Tab your bot repo name : `twitter-bot ` in your case.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*nX4Zcbm77GVLmu9s7NWwSQ.png)

Now you need to add all keys as Heroku vars on the tab settings and config the Variables section.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*VJgHnF6orcT1PGvyi_JxHA.png)

Return to the deploy section and click “enable automatic deploys”, then “deploy branch” button to deploy your app for the first time.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*fbJDa_hPhcR5ZTByd4rIZQ.png)

Go to resources section and activate the worker Dyno and disable the web dyno.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*rBSbnSWgrV0d0_lHh38JkQ.png)

To know if your app has been started successfully click to the  `more`  button at the top right of the page then click  `view logs`  option. you will found a simple console with some output similar to this screenshot, I have some new followers and the message has been sent successfully 🤓🤓.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*_IH2z4FhXeew5u5PGgW8Nw.png)

----------

### Live Demo

To make sure that’s the hole project work perfectly you need just to  [**follow**](https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2FElaziziYoussouf)  me and my twitter bot will send you a welcome message 🤗🤗.

----------

### How it works 💡

If you have already cloned the project to your computer you will see this structure:
```sh
$ cd twitter-bot  
$ tree .     
.  
├── config.js  
├── index.js  
├── LICENSE  
├── package.json  
├── Procfile  
├── README.md  
└── src  
    ├── AutoDM.js  
    └── Twit.js
```
As you can see the project is a simple node js app with an index.js file as an entry point:
> infex.js file
![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*Y-eOVjfnFZYCN5LQUblrhw.png)



The index file is a simple script that imports and calls the  `AutoDM`  function.

To make the app more fun we added a simple message when the app has started successfully.

As I have already mentioned I use the twit package to connect to the Twitter API, to do that we need to create a simple twitter app and init the Twit instance with your App config like the following:
> Twit.js file
![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*X4jq7jTLSq346ho5Y7WJ5A.png)


> config.js file
![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*gpIo0pnMOEGV_ApszXz-0A.png)



`process.env.XXXXXXX`  is an environment variable that we need to add to our Heroku app in deployment step.

Now the fun part is to Create the AutoDM function :

As you can see the  `AutoDM`  is a simple arrow function that listens to the stream  `follow`  event from the twitter API and executes the SendMessage function.
> AutoDM.js file
![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*kGF0ObTjFW4zIVA2.)



The  `sendMessge`  function gets as a parameter the user who follows you. All we need here is to create an obj with  `screen_name`  and a text message and send a post request to the Twitter API for sending a Direct Message to  `@screen_name`as the following.
> SendMessge Function
![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*8RHHjhuP5MMix6iyB1oFQA.png)



Now is you your turn to think how you would like to introduce yourself. You can modify the existing GenerateMessage Function to create your own welcome message, don’t forget to add some human behaviour in there, it makes more chance that the user clicks to your link or respond to your message.
> GenerateMessge Function

It is easy, doesn’t it? you can read more code from the Github repo.

==========
Bottleneck
==========

Bottleneck is a collection of fast, NaN-aware NumPy array functions
written in C.

As one example, to check if a ``np.array`` has any NaNs using numpy,
one must call ``np.any(np.isnan(array))``. The :meth:`bottleneck.anynan`
function interleaves the :meth:`np.isnan` check with :meth:`np.any`
pre-exit, enabling up to an ``O(N)`` speedup relative to numpy.

Bottleneck strives to be a drop-in accelerator for NumPy functions.
When using the following libraries, Bottleneck support is automatically
enabled and utilized:

 - `pandas <https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/install.html#recommended-dependencies>`_
 - `xarray <http://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/installing.html#instructions>`_
 - `astropy <https://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/install.html>`_

Details on the performance benefits can be found in :ref:`benchmarking`

Example
=======

Let's give it a try. Create a NumPy array::

    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> a = np.array([1, 2, np.nan, 4, 5])

Find the nanmean::

    >>> import bottleneck as bn
    >>> bn.nanmean(a)
    3.0

Moving window mean::

    >>> bn.move_mean(a, window=2, min_count=1)
    array([ 1. ,  1.5,  2. ,  4. ,  4.5])

.. _benchmarking:

Benchmark

Bottleneck comes with a benchmark suite::

You can also run a detailed benchmark for a single function using, for
example, the command::

    >>> bn.bench_detailed(""move_median"", fraction_nan=0.3)

Only arrays with data type (dtype) int32, int64, float32, and float64 are
accelerated. All other dtypes result in calls to slower, unaccelerated
functions. In the rare case of a byte-swapped input array (e.g. a big-endian
array on a little-endian operating system) the function will not be
accelerated regardless of dtype.

](preview.png)

Бот для добывания криптовалюты, выполняя задания ботов [dogeclick](https://dogeclick.com/)

Для работы трабуется установить [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), [Selenoid](https://github.com/aerokube/selenoid) и зависимости проекта

## План действий

0. Создать аккаунт телеграм и начать диалог с ботом из конгломерата [dogeclick](https://dogeclick.com/) и не забывайте о правилах правильной регистрации, о которых говорилось в видео
1. Вносим в скрипт create_db.py данные Telegram аккаунта и запускаем его. Тем самым мы создаем базу аккаунтов и добавляем в нее запись с ботом. Повторяем этот пункт столько раз, сколько аккаунтов у нас есть.
2. Запускаем скрипт create_client.py тем самым генерируем файл-клиент для всех наших Telegram ботов
3. Для старта главной программы запускаем скрипт main.py. Они будут работать до тех пор, пока мы их не остановим. Если в процессе возникнет ошибка - цикл перезапустится и все равно продолжит работу, начиная с первого бота
4. Если мы хотим узнать сколько заработал каждый бот: останавливаем пункт 3 и запускаем скрипт balance.py и ждем завершения, скрипт выведет сколько заработал каждый бот и итоговую сумму

UDP: 5. Добавил скрипт для автаматического вывода Vivod.py проверяет баланс, если он больше минимального значения для вывода, переводит средства на тот кошелек, который вы привязали к аккаунту в процессе создания базы


## Видео демонстрация:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig3JxDsvYGw

## Что еще важно помнить.
При массовой регистрации аккаунтов рекомендуется менять IP адрес не реже чем на 10 аккаунтов и ставить пароль 2х этапной аутентификации, получать API, взаимодействовать с ботами не сразу, а через 3-5 дней отлёжки

296,296,davechurchill/commandcenter,C++,"# CommandCenter: AI Bot for Broodwar and Starcraft II

CommandCenter is a StarCraft AI bot that can play both StarCraft: Broodwar and StarCraft 2.

![CommandCenter Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/SbTymsO.jpg)

CommandCenter is written in C++ using [BWAPI](https://github.com/bwapi/bwapi) and Blizzard's [StarCraft II AI API](https://github.com/Blizzard/s2client-api). It provides many wrapper functions around both APIs that allow it to perform the same functionality in both games via the same source code. It is written by [David Churchill](http://www.cs.mun.ca/~dchurchill/), Assistant Professor of [Computer Science](https://www.cs.mun.ca/) at Memorial University, and organizer of the [AIIDE StarCraft AI Competition](http://www.cs.mun.ca/~dchurchill/starcraftaicomp/).

CommandCenter is based on the architecture of [UAlbertaBot](https://github.com/davechurchill/ualbertabot/wiki), and is intended to be an easy to use architecture for you to quickly modify, play with, and build your own bot. The bot itself does not contain much in the way of hard-coded strategy or tactics, however it provides a good starting point for you to implement your own strategies for any race. 

CommandCenter currently provides the following features:
* Plays both Starcraft games with the same source code
* Plays all 3 races with generalized micro controllers for combat units
* Performs online map analysis, extracting information such as base locations and expansions
* Keeps track of all previously seen enemy units and their last known locations on the map
* Has a WorkerManager which manages resource gathering and worker allocation / buiding
* Is able to carry out predefined build-orders written in a configuration file
* Allows you to easily create your own build-orders and modify them on the fly in-game
* Contains a building placement algorithm, finding the closest buildable location to a given position for a given building 
* Scouts the map with a worker unit, discovering where the enemy base is located
* Once a specific condition has been reached (having 12 combat units, by default), it will commence an attack, sending waves of units at the enemy base
* Squads can be formed, consisting of multiple units following a specific order such as attack or defend a given location

CommandCenter should eventually have all of the functionality of UAlbertaBot, however much of its features are not currently completed. Here is an up-to-date list of features currently missing from CommandCenter that will be implemented soon:
* Only units and basic buildings can be constructed via the ProductionManager. No add-ons, research, or upgrades yet.
* There is no automatic build-order planning system
* There is no combat simulation package for predicting combat battle victory
* The bot only plays 1v1, and will have undefined behavior / crash if played against multiple enemies or on teams

# Download and Run CommandCenter

StarCraft BW: You must have StarCraft: Broodwar version 1.16.1 installed, as well as [BWAPI](https://github.com/bwapi/bwapi).

StarCraft 2: You must have an up-to-date retail version of StarCraft II installed to run the bot. You must also download and install some maps to use with the bot, which you can find here: https://github.com/Blizzard/s2client-proto#downloads. Please note that there is a password provided on that page to extract the maps from the zip files.

The bot comes with a configuration file named [BotConfig.txt](https://github.com/davechurchill/commandcenter/blob/master/bin/BotConfig.txt) in which you can modify build orders, print various debug information to the screen, and set some bot parameters. You can define multiple builds orders in the 'Strategies' section of the file, and choose which named strategy to implement when the bot plays a specific race. Unit names in the build-order are case sensitive, and must be exactly how they appear in-game with no spaces. Some of the options in the configuration file are currently not implemented, such as the KiteWithRangedUnits option.

Please note that this config file is in JSON format, and the bot will not run unless it is well-formatted JSON. The configuration file must be in the same directory as CommandCenter.exe in order for the bot to run correctly. If you have made an error in the JSON syntax and can't find it on your own, you can use an online [JSON Validator](https://jsonlint.com/) to check for you.

By default when you run CommandCenter.exe, it will play as Random race vs. a Random race built-in SC2 Easy AI. You can modify which races are played in the configuration file via the ""BotRace"" and ""EnemyRace"" options. You can also modify which map to be played by specifying the ""MapFile"" option. Please note that the MapFile option is relative to your StarCraft II maps directory, which by default is located in your StarCraft_Install_Directory/maps/, and the bot will not run without specifying a valid map file.

If the bot crashes or does other nasty things, please bear with me while I make it more stable :)

# Developer Install / Compile Instructions (Windows)

* Download and install [Visual Studio 2017](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/)
* To play BW, you must download and install StarCraft BW v1.16.1 as well as [BWAPI](https://github.com/bwapi/bwapi)
* To play SC2, you must download and install the [StarCraft II AI API](https://github.com/Blizzard/s2client-api). The easiest way to do this is to download the [Precompiled Libraries](https://github.com/Blizzard/s2client-api#precompiled-libs) at the bottom of the page, and simply extract them to a folder on your PC. If you are getting the SC2API via cloning the Blizzard github repo and compiling it from scratch, you may need to point VS to different directories for include and lib than the ones described below.
* Clone this git repository to a folder on your PC
* Open ""CommandCenter/vs/CommandCenter.sln"" in VS2017
* If you compile the CommandCenter project with the x64 Platform, it will compile the SC2 bot
* If you compile the CommandCenter project with the x86 or Win32 Platform, it will compile the BW bot
* Set the VS Project include and lib folders to point to the directories
  * Right click the CommandCenter project in VS2017
  * Select ""Properties""
  * Select the correct configuration that you want to build in the top left (""Release"" or ""Debug"")
  * Select the target platform you want to build (x64 = SC2, Win32 = BW)
  * Select ""VC++ Directories"" on the left
  * Select the ""Include Directories"" option in the table on the right
  * Click the dropdown arrow on the right and click Edit...
  * Modify the existing directory entry to point to your (SC2API|BWAPI)/include directory
  * Select the ""Library Directories"" option in the table on the right
  * Click the dropdown arrow on the right and click Edit...
  * Modify the existing directory entry to point to your (SC2API|BWAPI)/lib directory
* From the ""Build"" menu, click ""Build Solution""
* The binary ""CommandCenter_API.exe"" should appear in the CommandCenter/bin/ directory
* Run the CommandCenter bot by either:
  * Double clicking the executable in the CommandCenter/bin/ directory
  * Running the program from the console
  * Click ""Local Windows Debugger"" in VS to launch the program from within VS. To do this, you need to set the ""Working Directory"" option under ""Debugging"" to ""$(ProjectDir)/../bin/"" (I don't know why this option won't save)
* If you are running the BW version of the bot, you must then start BW via Chaoslauncher with BWAPI injected
* The CommandCenter/bin/BotConfig.txt file must be in the same directory as the .exe to run properly

# Developer Install / Compile Instructions (Linux and OS X)


With these steps you should be able to build and install the SC2 API and include it into CommandCenter. It has been tested successfully for [aba2d3813571c344090f3de5b58a5c912cd5acb3](https://github.com/Blizzard/s2client-api/commit/aba2d3813571c344090f3de5b58a5c912cd5acb3), so if the install instructions below don't work checkout that version of the SC2 API

`$ git checkout aba2d3813571c344090f3de5b58a5c912cd5acb3 .`

and repeat the instructions.

* Build SC2 API project
```bash
$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/Blizzard/s2client-api && cd s2client-api
$ mkdir build && cd build
$ cmake ../
$ make
```

* Install the SC2 API libraries and headers to your system
```bash
# Assuming that you are located in the 'build' directory
# after you finished the previous step
$ cd ../

# Install SC2 API headers
$ sudo mkdir -p /opt/local/include
$ sudo cp -R include/{sc2api,sc2renderer,sc2utils} /opt/local/include
$ sudo cp -R build/generated/s2clientprotocol /opt/local/include

# Install protobuf headers
$ sudo cp -R contrib/protobuf/src/google /opt/local/include/sc2api

# Install SC2 API libraries
$ sudo mkdir -p /opt/local/lib/sc2api
$ sudo cp build/bin/{libcivetweb,libprotobuf,libsc2api,libsc2lib,libsc2protocol,libsc2utils}.a /opt/local/lib/sc2api
```

* Build the bot
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/davechurchill/commandcenter.git && cd commandcenter
$ cmake .
$ make
```

# Bot Development

If you are familiar with the architecture of UAlbertaBot, the logic of CommandCenter is quite similar. The biggest difference is that information relating to the map, baselocation, etc are no longer globally accessible. This data now lives inside the main CCBot class, and must be accessed via a reference to the instance of that class. Because of this, most classes in CommandCenter carry with them a reference to the bot's main CCBot object, from which all game related information, observations, and queries can be made.

An in-depth development guide will be coming soon, but please refer to the [UAlbertaBot wiki](https://github.com/davechurchill/ualbertabot/wiki) for now since the architecture is so similar (minus the build order planner and combat simulator).

Download
--------

Gradle:
```groovy
compile 'com.github.armcha:LuseenBottomNavigation:1.8.2'
```
Maven:
```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.github.armcha</groupId>
  <artifactId>LuseenBottomNavigation</artifactId>
  <version>1.8.2</version>

</dependency>
```
Usage
-----

Add the BottomNavigationView to your layout

```xml
 <com.luseen.luseenbottomnavigation.BottomNavigation.BottomNavigationView
        android:id=""@+id/bottomNavigation""
        android:layout_width=""match_parent""
        android:layout_height=""wrap_content""
        android:layout_alignParentBottom=""true"" />
```

Add BottomNavigation items 

```java
  BottomNavigationView bottomNavigationView = (BottomNavigationView) findViewById(R.id.bottomNavigation);
  
   BottomNavigationItem bottomNavigationItem = new BottomNavigationItem
                (""Record"", ContextCompat.getColor(this, R.color.firstColor), R.drawable.ic_mic_black_24dp);
   BottomNavigationItem bottomNavigationItem1 = new BottomNavigationItem
                (""Like"", ContextCompat.getColor(this, R.color.secondColor), R.drawable.ic_favorite_black_24dp);
  bottomNavigationView.addTab(bottomNavigationItem);
  bottomNavigationView.addTab(bottomNavigationItem1);
```

Then set your `OnBottomNavigationItemClickListener`

```java
 
bottomNavigationView.setOnBottomNavigationItemClickListener(new OnBottomNavigationItemClickListener() {
            @Override
            public void onNavigationItemClick(int index) {
                 Toast.makeText(MainActivity.this, ""Item "" +index +"" clicked"", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
            }
        });
```
If you are using a `ViewPager` , you can connect to the `BottomNavigationView`,
Set color in this way, when using view pager:
  
  ```java
   ContextCompat.getColor(context, R.color.firstColor)
   bottomNavigationView.setUpWithViewPager(yourPager , colorResources , imageResources);
  ```
You can disable slide animation when using viewPager
  ```java
  bottomNavigationView.disableViewPagerSlide();
  ```
  
If your activity/fragment will not recreate and bottom navigation items doubled on orientation change,
just can call this method
     
```java
bottomNavigationView.willNotRecreate(true);
```


Customize
---------

Customize with xml

```xml
  <com.luseen.luseenbottomnavigation.BottomNavigation.BottomNavigationView
         android:id=""@+id/bottomNavigation""
         android:layout_width=""match_parent""
         android:layout_height=""wrap_content""
         android:layout_alignParentBottom=""true""
         app:bnv_colored_background=""true""

## How to use
### 1. Check Permission
You have to grant `WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` permission from user.<br/>
If your targetSDK version is 23+, you have to check permission and request permission to user.<br/>
Because after Marshmallow(6.0), you have to not only declare permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml` but also request permissions at runtime.<br/>
There are so many permission check library in [Android-Arsenal](http://android-arsenal.com/tag/235?sort=rating)<br/>
I recommend [TedPermission](https://github.com/ParkSangGwon/TedPermission)<br/>
**TedPermission** is super simple and smart permission check library.<br/>
<br/>

[![Issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/LucasMucGH/BottomSheet)](https://github.com/LucasMucGH/BottomSheet/issues)

A sliding Sheet from the bottom of the Screen with 3 States build with SwiftUI.

## Why

There have been many different attempts to recreate the BottomSheet from Apple Maps, Shortcuts and Apple Music, because Apple unfortunately does not provide it in their SDK.

However, all previous attempts share a common problem: The **height does not change** in the different states. Thus, the BottomSheet is always the same size (e.g. 800px) and thus remains 800px, even if you only see e.g. 400px - the rest is **inaccessible** unless you pull the BottomSheet up to the very top.

There are also many implementations out there that **only have 2 states** - **not 3** like e.g. Apple Maps.

### Features
- Dynamic height (works with `ScrollView` and **every** other view)
- Fully customizable States (**any number of states at any height**)
- Many options for **customization** (backgroundBlur, tapToDismiss, swipeToDismiss, etc.)
- Very **easy to use**
- Support for **SearchBar** in the header
- Flick through feature
- Same behavior as Apple for the `.bottom` position
- Beatuiful customizable **animations**

## Requirements 

- iOS 13
- Swift 5.3
- Xcode 12

## Installation

### Swift Package Manager

The preferred way of installing BottomSheet is via the [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/).

>Xcode 11 integrates with libSwiftPM to provide support for iOS, watchOS, and tvOS platforms.

1. In Xcode, open your project and navigate to **File** → **Swift Packages** → **Add Package Dependency...**
2. Paste the repository URL (`https://github.com/LucasMucGH/BottomSheet`) and click **Next**.
3. For **Rules**, select **Branch** (with branch set to `main`).
4. Click **Finish**.

### CocoaPods

BottomSheet is available through [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org). To install it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod 'BottomSheetSwiftUI'
```

## Usage

**WARNING:**
This is Sample Code for visualisation where and how to use, without a working initializer. Please see [Examples](#examples) for working code.

BottomSheet is similar to the built-in Sheet:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {

    @State var bottomSheetPosition: BottomSheetPosition = .middle //1
    
    var body: some View {
    
        Map() //2
            .bottomSheet() //3
    }
}
```

`//1` The current State of the BottomSheet.
- This is any `enum` that conforms to `CGFloat` and `CaseIterable`. For more information about custom enums see [Custom States](#custom-states).
- The following states are posible when using the predefinded `BottomSheetPosition`: `.hidden`, `.bottom`, `.middle` and `.top`.
- If you don't want the state to be changed, you can use `.constant(.middle)` (with the `.notResizeable` or `.noDragIndicator` option).

`//2` The view which the BottomSheet overlays.

`//3` This is how you add the BottomSheet - easy right?

## Parameters

### Title as Header Content

```swift
.bottomSheet(
    bottomSheetPosition: Binding<BottomSheetPosition>,
    options: [BottomSheet.Options] = [],
    title: String? = nil,
    @ViewBuilder content: () -> mContent
)
```

`bottomSheetPosition`: A binding that saves the current state of the BottomSheet.
- This can be any `enum` that conforms to `CGFloat` and `CaseIterable`. For more information about custom enums see [Custom States](#custom-states).
- The following states are posible when using the predefinded `BottomSheetPosition`: `.hidden`, `.bottom`, `.middle` and `.top`.
- If you don't want the state to be changed, you can use `.constant(.middle)` for example (should be used with the `.notResizeable` or `.noDragIndicator` option).

`options`: An array that contains the settings / options for the BottomSheet. For more information about the possible options see [Options](#options).

`title`: A string that is used as the title for the BottomSheet.
- Can be `nil`.
- You can use a view that is used as header content for the BottomSheet instead.

`content`: A view that is used as main content for the BottomSheet.

### Custom Header Content

```swift
.bottomSheet(
    bottomSheetPosition: Binding<BottomSheetPosition>,
    options: [BottomSheet.Options] = [],
    @ViewBuilder headerContent: () -> hContent?,
    @ViewBuilder mainContent: () -> mContent
)
```

`bottomSheetPosition`: A binding that saves the current state of the BottomSheet.
- This can be any `enum` that conforms to `CGFloat` and `CaseIterable`. For more information about custom enums see [Custom States](#custom-states).
- The following states are posible when using the predefinded `BottomSheetPosition`: `.hidden`, `.bottom`, `.middle` and `.top`.
- If you don't want the state to be changed, you can use `.constant(.middle)` for example (should be used with the `.notResizeable` or `.noDragIndicator` option).

`options`: An array that contains the settings / options for the BottomSheet. For more information about the possible options see [Options](#options).

`headerContent`: A view that is used as header content for the BottomSheet.
- Can be `nil`.
- You can use a string that is used as the title for the BottomSheet instead.
- Any view is possible - this can lead to problems if the view is too large. A label, a small picture or text is recommended

`mainContent`: A view that is used as main content for the BottomSheet.

### Options

`.absolutePositionValue` Allows absolute values in pixels to be used as BottomSheetPosition values.

`.allowContentDrag` Allows the BottomSheet to move when dragging the mainContent.

- Do not use if the mainContent is packed into a ScrollView.

`.animation(Animation)` Sets the animation for opening and closing the BottomSheet.

`.appleScrollBehavior` The mainView is packed into a ScrollView, which can only scrolled at the .top position.

`.background(AnyView)` Changes the background of the BottomSheet.
- Must be erased to AnyView.

`.backgroundBlur(UIBlurEffect.Style = .systemThinMaterial)` Enables and sets the blur effect of the background when pulling up the BottomSheet.

`.cornerRadius(Double)` Changes the corener radius of the BottomSheet.

`.dragIndicatorColor(Color)` Changes the color of the drag indicator.

 `.noBottomPosition` Prevents the lowest value (above 0) from being the bottom position and hiding the mainContent.
 
 `.noDragIndicator` Hides the drag indicator.
 
 `.notResizeable` Hides the drag indicator and prevents the BottomSheet from being dragged.
 
 `.shadow(color: Color = Color(.sRGBLinear, white: 0, opacity: 0.33), radius: CGFloat = 10, x: CGFloat = 0, y: CGFloat = 0)` Adds a shadow to the background of the BottomSheet.
 
 `.showCloseButton(action: () -> Void = {})` Shows a close button and declares an action to be performed when tapped.
 
 - If you tap on it, the BottomSheet and the keyboard always get dismissed.
 
 - If you want to do something extra, you have to declare it here.
 
 `.swipeToDismiss` Dismisses the BottomSheet when swiped down.
 
 `.tapToDismiss` Dismisses the BottomSheet when the background is tapped.

## Custom States

You can create your own custom BottomSheetPosition enum:
   - The enum must be conforming to `CGFloat` and `CaseIterable`
   - The case and enum name doesnt matter
   - The case/state with `rawValue == 0` is hiding the BottomSheet
   - The value can be anythig between `0` and `1` (`x <= 1`, `x >= 0`) or anything above `0` (`x >= 0`) when using the`.absolutePositionValue` option
   - The value is the height of the BottomSheet propotional to the screen height (`1 == 100% == full screen`) or the height of the BottomSheet in pixel (`1 == 1px`) when using the`.absolutePositionValue` option
   - The lowest value (greater than 0) automaticly gets the `.bottom` behavior. To prevent this please use the option `.noBottomPosition`

This BottomSheetPosition is provided and uses relative values:
```swift
public enum BottomSheetPosition: CGFloat, CaseIterable {
    case top = 0.975, middle = 0.4, bottom = 0.125, hidden = 0
}
```

This BottomSheetPositionAbsolute is provided and uses absolute values and requires the the`.absolutePositionValue` option:
```swift
public enum BottomSheetPositionAbsolute: CGFloat, CaseIterable {
    case top = 750, middle = 300, bottom = 100, hidden = 0
}
```

This CustomBottomSheetPosition is an example for a custom BottomSheetPosition with relative values:
```swift
public enum CustomBottomSheetPosition: CGFloat, CaseIterable {
    case middle = 0.5, hidden = 0
}
```

## Examples

**PLEASE NOTE:** When installed via Cocoapods, please keep in mind that the pod is called `BottomSheetSwiftUI` and not `BottomSheet`; so please use `import BottomSheetSwiftUI` instead.

### Book Detail View

This BottomSheet shows additional information about a book.
You can close it by swiping it away, by tapping on the background or the close button.
The drag indicator is hidden.
It uses a custom `enum` for the states with absolute values, since only the states `.middle`, `.bottom` and `.hidden` should exist with a predefined absolute height.

### Word Search View

This BottomSheet shows nouns which can be filtered by searching.
It adopts the scrolling behavior of apple, so that you can only scroll the `ScrollView` in the `.top` position.
The higher the BottomSheet is dragged, the more blurry the background becomes (with the BlurEffect .dark) to move the focus to the BottomSheet.

### Artist Songs View

This BottomSheet shows the most popular songs by an artist.
It has a custom animation and color for the drag indicator and the background, as well as it deactivates the bottom position behavior and uses an custom corner radius and shadow.

[![Say Thanks!](https://img.shields.io/badge/Say%20Thanks!-🦉-1EAEDB.svg)](https://saythanks.io/to/atipugin)

## Installation

Add following line to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'telegram-bot-ruby'
```

And then execute:

```shell
$ bundle
```

Or install it system-wide:

```shell
$ gem install telegram-bot-ruby
```

## Usage

First things first, you need to [obtain a token](https://core.telegram.org/bots#6-botfather) for your bot. Then create your Telegram bot like this:

```ruby
require 'telegram/bot'

token = 'YOUR_TELEGRAM_BOT_API_TOKEN'

Telegram::Bot::Client.run(token) do |bot|
  bot.listen do |message|
    case message.text
    when '/start'
      bot.api.send_message(chat_id: message.chat.id, text: ""Hello, #{message.from.first_name}"")
    when '/stop'
      bot.api.send_message(chat_id: message.chat.id, text: ""Bye, #{message.from.first_name}"")
    end
  end
end
```

Note that `bot.api` object implements [Telegram Bot API methods](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#available-methods) as is. So you can invoke any method inside the block without any problems. All methods are available in both *snake_case* and *camelCase* notations.

Same thing about `message` object - it implements [Message](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#message) spec, so you always know what to expect from it.

## Webhooks

If you are going to use [webhooks](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#setwebhook) instead of [long polling](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#getupdates), you need to implement your own webhook callbacks server. Take a look at [this repo](https://github.com/solyaris/BOTServer) as an example.

## Proxy

As some countries block access to Telegram, you can set up your own proxy and use it to access Telegram API. In this case you need to configure API url:

```ruby
Telegram::Bot::Client.run(token, url: 'https://proxy.example.com') do |bot|
  # ...
end
```

## Custom keyboards

You can use your own [custom keyboards](https://core.telegram.org/bots#keyboards). Here is an example:

```ruby
bot.listen do |message|
  case message.text
  when '/start'
    question = 'London is a capital of which country?'
    # See more: https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#replykeyboardmarkup
    answers =
      Telegram::Bot::Types::ReplyKeyboardMarkup
      .new(keyboard: [%w(A B), %w(C D)], one_time_keyboard: true)
    bot.api.send_message(chat_id: message.chat.id, text: question, reply_markup: answers)
  when '/stop'
    # See more: https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#replykeyboardremove
    kb = Telegram::Bot::Types::ReplyKeyboardRemove.new(remove_keyboard: true)
    bot.api.send_message(chat_id: message.chat.id, text: 'Sorry to see you go :(', reply_markup: kb)
  end
end
```

Furthermore, you can ask user to share location or phone number using `KeyboardButton`:

```ruby
bot.listen do |message|
  kb = [
    Telegram::Bot::Types::KeyboardButton.new(text: 'Give me your phone number', request_contact: true),
    Telegram::Bot::Types::KeyboardButton.new(text: 'Show me your location', request_location: true)
  ]
  markup = Telegram::Bot::Types::ReplyKeyboardMarkup.new(keyboard: kb)
  bot.api.send_message(chat_id: message.chat.id, text: 'Hey!', reply_markup: markup)
end
```

## Inline keyboards

[Bot API 2.0](https://core.telegram.org/bots/2-0-intro) brought us new inline keyboards. Example:

```ruby
bot.listen do |message|
  case message
  when Telegram::Bot::Types::CallbackQuery
    # Here you can handle your callbacks from inline buttons
    if message.data == 'touch'
      bot.api.send_message(chat_id: message.from.id, text: ""Don't touch me!"")
    end
  when Telegram::Bot::Types::Message
    kb = [
      Telegram::Bot::Types::InlineKeyboardButton.new(text: 'Go to Google', url: 'https://google.com'),
      Telegram::Bot::Types::InlineKeyboardButton.new(text: 'Touch me', callback_data: 'touch'),
      Telegram::Bot::Types::InlineKeyboardButton.new(text: 'Switch to inline', switch_inline_query: 'some text')
    ]
    markup = Telegram::Bot::Types::InlineKeyboardMarkup.new(inline_keyboard: kb)
    bot.api.send_message(chat_id: message.chat.id, text: 'Make a choice', reply_markup: markup)
  end
end
```

## Inline bots

If you are going to create [inline bot](https://core.telegram.org/bots/inline), check the example below:

```ruby
bot.listen do |message|
  case message
  when Telegram::Bot::Types::InlineQuery
    results = [
      [1, 'First article', 'Very interesting text goes here.'],
      [2, 'Second article', 'Another interesting text here.']
    ].map do |arr|
      Telegram::Bot::Types::InlineQueryResultArticle.new(
        id: arr[0],
        title: arr[1],
        input_message_content: Telegram::Bot::Types::InputTextMessageContent.new(message_text: arr[2])
      )
    end

    bot.api.answer_inline_query(inline_query_id: message.id, results: results)
  when Telegram::Bot::Types::Message
    bot.api.send_message(chat_id: message.chat.id, text: ""Hello, #{message.from.first_name}!"")
  end
end
```

Now, with `inline` mode enabled, your `message` object can be an instance of [Message](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#message), [InlineQuery](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#inlinequery) or [ChosenInlineResult](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#choseninlineresult). That's why you need to check type of each message and decide how to handle it.

Using `answer_inline_query` you can send query results to user. `results` field must be an array of [query result objects](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#inlinequeryresult).

## File upload

Your bot can even upload files ([photos](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#sendphoto), [audio](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#sendaudio), [documents](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#senddocument), [stickers](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#sendsticker), [video](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#sendvideo)) to Telegram servers. Just like this:

```ruby
bot.listen do |message|
  case message.text
  when '/photo'
    bot.api.send_photo(chat_id: message.chat.id, photo: Faraday::UploadIO.new('~/Desktop/jennifer.jpg', 'image/jpeg'))
  end
end
```

## Logging

By default, bot doesn't log anything (uses `NullLoger`). You can change this behavior and provide your own logger class. See example below:

```ruby
Telegram::Bot::Client.run(token, logger: Logger.new($stderr)) do |bot|
  bot.logger.info('Bot has been started')
  bot.listen do |message|
    # ...
  end
end
```

## Connection adapters

Since version `0.5.0` we rely on [faraday](https://github.com/lostisland/faraday) under the hood. You can use any of supported adapters (for example, `net/http/persistent`):

```ruby
require 'net/http/persistent'

Telegram::Bot.configure do |config|
  config.adapter = :net_http_persistent
end
```

## Boilerplates

If you don't know how to setup database for your bot or how to use it with different languages here are some boilerplates which can help you to start faster:

![Travis CI status](https://api.travis-ci.org/witnessmenow/Universal-Arduino-Telegram-Bot.svg?branch=master)
![License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/witnessmenow/Universal-Arduino-Telegram-Bot)
![Release stable](https://badgen.net/github/release/witnessmenow/Universal-Arduino-Telegram-Bot/stable)

An Arduino IDE library for using Telegram Bot API. It's designed to be used with multiple Arduino architectures.

Join the [Arduino Telegram Library Group Chat](https://t.me/arduino_telegram_library) if you have any questions/feedback or would just like to be kept up to date with the library's progress.

## Help support what I do!

I have created a lot of different Arduino libraries that I hope people can make use of. [If you enjoy my work, please consider becoming a Github sponsor!](https://github.com/sponsors/witnessmenow/)

## Introduction

This library provides an interface for [Telegram Bot API](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api).

Telegram is an instant messaging service that allows for the creation of bots. Bots can be configured to send and receive messages. This is useful for Arduino projects as you can receive updates from your project or issue it commands via your Telegram app from anywhere.

This is a library forked from [one library](https://github.com/Gianbacchio/ESP8266-TelegramBot) and inspired by [another](https://github.com/CasaJasmina/TelegramBot-Library)

Each library only supported a single type of Arduino and had different features implemented. The only thing that needs to be different for each board is the actual sending of requests to Telegram so I thought a library that additional architectures or boards could be configured easily would be useful, although this springs to mind:

![alt text](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/standards.png ""standards"")

## Installing

The downloaded code can be included as a new library into the IDE selecting the menu:

```
 Sketch / include Library / Add .Zip library
```

You also have to install the ArduinoJson library written by [Benoît Blanchon](https://github.com/bblanchon). Search for it on the Arduino Library manager or get it from [here](https://github.com/bblanchon/ArduinoJson).

## Getting Started

To generate your new Bot, you need an Access Token. Talk to [BotFather](https://telegram.me/botfather) and follow a few simple steps described [here](https://core.telegram.org/bots#botfather).

Include UniversalTelegramBot in your project:

```ino
#include <UniversalTelegramBot.h>
```

and pass it a Bot token and a SSL Client (See the [examples](https://github.com/witnessmenow/Universal-Arduino-Telegram-Bot/tree/master/examples) for more details)

```ino
// Telegram BOT Token (Get from Botfather)
#define BOT_TOKEN ""XXXXXXXXX:XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX""
WiFiClientSecure secured_client;
UniversalTelegramBot bot(BOT_TOKEN, secured_client);
```

## Features

Here is a list of features that this library covers. (Note: The examples link to the ESP8266 versions)

| _Receiving Messages_         | Your bot can read messages that are sent to it. This is useful for sending commands to your arduino such as toggle and LED                                                                                                                                                                                                   | `int getUpdates(long offset)` <br><br> Gets any pending messages from Telegram and stores them in **bot.messages** . Offset should be set to **bot.last_message_received** + 1. Returns the numbers new messages received.                                                                                   | [FlashLED](https://github.com/witnessmenow/Universal-Arduino-Telegram-Bot/blob/master/examples/ESP8266/FlashLED/FlashLED.ino) or any other example                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| _Sending messages_           | Your bot can send messages to any Telegram or group. This can be useful to get the arduino to notify you of an event e.g. Button pressed etc (Note: bots can only message you if you messaged them first)                                                                                                                    | `bool sendMessage(String chat_id, String text, String parse_mode = """")` <br><br> Sends the message to the chat_id. Returns if the message sent or not.                                                                                                                                                       | [EchoBot](https://github.com/witnessmenow/Universal-Arduino-Telegram-Bot/blob/master/examples/ESP8266/EchoBot/EchoBot.ino#L51) or any other example                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EF888S4WkAE0eY8?format=jpg&name=4096x4096)

## Unity version
The Unity version used is 2021.2.5, with URP 12.1.2.

## Production-readiness
The shader is provides as-is, and its production readiness is not guaranteed.
Some features missing are:
- The ability to bake
- Support for secondary lights (point, spot)
- Reflection probe support

The project is born to act as initial inspiration. Any additional needed feature will need to be implemented by you.

## Usage
You can refer to my two talks on Shader Graph from Unite Copenhagen 2019 to learn how to use this repository, and for general tips:
- [Shader Graph: Ready for Production](https://youtu.be/L6mU2rkT5To)
- [Creating a Stylised Toon Shader with Shader Graph](https://youtu.be/DOLE4nrK97g) (this is a breakdown of the shader contained here)

## Owner
Project created by Ciro Continisio. If you have questions, you can get in touch [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/cirocontns)

The shader can be freely used for commercial purposes, no need for credit (though it would be nice).
Assets included are part of a Unity asset pack (see license for details).

### Botan SDK (not supported more)

[Botan](http://botan.io) is a telegram bot analytics system based on [Yandex.Appmetrica](http://appmetrica.yandex.com/).
In this document you can find how to setup Yandex.Appmetrica account, as well as examples of Botan SDK usage.

### Creating an account
 * Register at http://appmetrica.yandex.com/
 * After registration you will be prompted to create Application. Please use @YourBotName as a name.
 * Save an API key from settings page, you will use it as a token for Botan API calls.
 * Download lib for your language, and use it as described below. Don`t forget to insert your token!

Since we are only getting started, you may discover that some existing reports in AppMetriсa aren't properly working for Telegram bots, like Geography, Gender, Age, Library, Devices, Traffic sources and Network sections. We will polish that later.

## SDK usage

#### Standalone

```php
$tracker = new \TelegramBot\Api\Botan('YOUR_BOTAN_TRACKER_API_KEY');

$tracker->track($message, $eventName);
```

#### API Wrapper
```php
$bot = new \TelegramBot\Api\BotApi('YOUR_BOT_API_TOKEN', 'YOUR_BOTAN_TRACKER_API_KEY');

$bot->track($message, $eventName);
```

 You can use method 'getUpdates()'and all incoming messages will be automatically tracked as `Message`-event.

#### Client
```php
$bot = new \TelegramBot\Api\Client('YOUR_BOT_API_TOKEN', 'YOUR_BOTAN_TRACKER_API_KEY');
```

_All registered commands are automatically tracked as command name_

Creating a Giphy Chat Bot in 3 minutes:

[![IMG](http://i.imgur.com/gDL7Tw2.gif)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flYeg7Hdxzw&feature=youtu.be)

## Getting Started

- Install BootBot via NPM, create a new `index.js`, require BootBot and create a new bot instance using your Facebook Page's / App's `accessToken`, `verifyToken` and `appSecret`:

**Note:** If you don't know how to get these tokens, take a look at Facebook's [Quick Start Guide](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/guides/quick-start) or check out [this issue](https://github.com/Charca/bootbot/issues/56).

```javascript
// index.js
'use strict';
const BootBot = require('bootbot');

const bot = new BootBot({
  accessToken: 'FB_ACCESS_TOKEN',
  verifyToken: 'FB_VERIFY_TOKEN',
  appSecret: 'FB_APP_SECRET'
});
```

- Subscribe to messages sent by the user with the `bot.on()` and `bot.hear()` methods:

```javascript
bot.on('message', (payload, chat) => {
	const text = payload.message.text;
	console.log(`The user said: ${text}`);
});

bot.hear(['hello', 'hi', /hey( there)?/i], (payload, chat) => {
	console.log('The user said ""hello"", ""hi"", ""hey"", or ""hey there""');
});
```

- Reply to user messages using the `chat` object:

```javascript
bot.hear(['hello', 'hi', /hey( there)?/i], (payload, chat) => {
	// Send a text message followed by another text message that contains a typing indicator
	chat.say('Hello, human friend!').then(() => {
		chat.say('How are you today?', { typing: true });
	});
});

bot.hear(['food', 'hungry'], (payload, chat) => {
	// Send a text message with quick replies
	chat.say({
		text: 'What do you want to eat today?',
		quickReplies: ['Mexican', 'Italian', 'American', 'Argentine']
	});
});

bot.hear(['help'], (payload, chat) => {
	// Send a text message with buttons
	chat.say({
		text: 'What do you need help with?',
		buttons: [
			{ type: 'postback', title: 'Settings', payload: 'HELP_SETTINGS' },
			{ type: 'postback', title: 'FAQ', payload: 'HELP_FAQ' },
			{ type: 'postback', title: 'Talk to a human', payload: 'HELP_HUMAN' }
		]
	});
});

bot.hear('image', (payload, chat) => {
	// Send an attachment
	chat.say({
		attachment: 'image',
		url: 'http://example.com/image.png'
	});
});
```

- Start a conversation and keep the user's answers in `context`:

```javascript
bot.hear('ask me something', (payload, chat) => {

	const askName = (convo) => {
		convo.ask(`What's your name?`, (payload, convo) => {
			const text = payload.message.text;
			convo.set('name', text);
			convo.say(`Oh, your name is ${text}`).then(() => askFavoriteFood(convo));
		});
	};

	const askFavoriteFood = (convo) => {
		convo.ask(`What's your favorite food?`, (payload, convo) => {
			const text = payload.message.text;
			convo.set('food', text);
			convo.say(`Got it, your favorite food is ${text}`).then(() => sendSummary(convo));
		});
	};

	const sendSummary = (convo) => {
		convo.say(`Ok, here's what you told me about you:
	      - Name: ${convo.get('name')}
	      - Favorite Food: ${convo.get('food')}`);
      convo.end();
	};

	chat.conversation((convo) => {
		askName(convo);
	});
});
```

- Set up webhooks and start the express server:

```javascript
bot.start();
```

- Start up your bot by running node:

```
$ node index.js
> BootBot running on port 3000
> Facebook Webhook running on localhost:3000/webhook
```

- If you want to test your bot locally, install a localhost tunnel like [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) and run it on your bot's port:

```
$ ngrok http 3000
```

Then use the provided HTTPS URL to config your webhook on Facebook's Dashboard. For example if the URL provided by ngrok is `https://99b8d4c2.ngrok.io`, use `https://99b8d4c2.ngrok.io/webhook`.

## Documentation

### BootBot Class

#### `new BootBot(options)`

| `options` key | Type | Default | Required |
|:--------------|:-----|:--------|:---------|
| `accessToken` | string | | `Y` |
| `verifyToken` | string | | `Y` |
| `appSecret` | string | | `Y` |
| `webhook` | string | `""/webhook""` | `N` |
| `broadcastEchoes` | boolean | `false` | `N` |
| `graphApiVersion` | string | `v2.12` | `N` |

Creates a new `BootBot` instance. Instantiates the new express app and all required webhooks. `options` param must contain all tokens and app secret of your Facebook app. Optionally, set `broadcastEchoes` to `true` if you want the messages your bot send to be echoed back to it (you probably don't need this feature unless you have multiple bots running on the same Facebook page).

If you want to specify a custom endpoint name for your webhook, you can do it with the `webhook` option.

#### `.start([ port ])`

| Param | Type | Default | Required |
|:------|:-----|:--------|:---------|
| `port` | number | `3000` | `N` |

Starts the express server on the specified port. Defaults port to 3000.

#### `.close()`

Closes the express server (calls `.close()` on the server instance).

---

### Receive API

Use these methods to subscribe your bot to messages, attachments or anything the user might send.

#### `.on(event, callback)`

| Param | Type | Default | Required |
|:------|:-----|:--------|:---------|
| `event` | string | | `Y` |
| `callback` | function | | `Y` |

Subscribe to an event emitted by the bot, and execute a callback when those events are emitted. Available events are:

| Event | Description |
|:------|:-----|
| `message` | The bot received a text message from the user |
| `quick_reply` | The bot received a quick reply from the user (quick replies emit both `message` and `quick_reply` events) |
| `attachment` | The bot received an attachment from the user |
| `postback` | The bot received a postback call from the user (usually means the user clicked a button) |
| `delivery` | The bot received a confirmation that your message was delivered to the user |
| `read` | The bot received a confirmation that your message was read by the user |
| `authentication` | A user has started a conversation with the bot using a ""Send to Messenger"" button |
| `referral` | A user that already has a thread with the bot starts a conversation. [more](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/reference/webhook-events/messaging_referrals) |

You can also subscribe to specific postbacks and quick replies by using a namespace. For example `postback:ADD_TO_CART` subscribes only to the postback event containing the `ADD_TO_CART` payload.

If you want to subscribe to specific keywords on a `message` event, see the `.hear()` method below.

When these events ocurr, the specified callback will be invoked with 3 params: `(payload, chat, data)`

| Param | Description |
|:------|:-----|
| `payload` | The data sent by the user (contains the text of the message, the attachment, etc.) |
| `chat` | A `Chat` instance that you can use to reply to the user. Contains all the methods defined in the [Send API](#send-api) |
| `data` | Contains extra data provided by the framework, like a `captured` flag that signals if this message was already captured by a different callback |

##### `.on()` examples:

```javascript
bot.on('message', (payload, chat) => {
	console.log('A text message was received!');
});

bot.on('attachment', (payload, chat) => {
	console.log('An attachment was received!');
});

bot.on('postback:HELP_ME', (payload, chat) => {
	console.log('The Help Me button was clicked!');
});

bot.on('message', (payload, chat) => {
	// Reply to the user
	chat.say('Hey, user. I got your message!');
});
```

#### `.hear(keywords, callback)`

| Param | Type | Default | Required |
|:------|:-----|:--------|:---------|
| `keywords` | string, regex or mixed array | | `Y` |
| `callback` | function | | `Y` |

A convinient method to subscribe to `message` events containing specific keywords. The `keyword` param can be a string, a regex or an array of both strings and regexs that will be tested against the received message. If the bot receives a message that matches any of the keywords, it will execute the specified `callback`. String keywords are case-insensitive, but regular expressions are not case-insensitive by default, if you want them to be, specify the `i` flag.

The callback's signature is identical to that of the `.on()` method above.

##### `.hear()` examples:

```javascript
bot.hear('hello', (payload, chat) => {
	chat.say('Hello, human!');
});

bot.hear(['hello', 'hi', 'hey'], (payload, chat) => {
	chat.say('Hello, human!');
});

bot.hear([/(good)?bye/i, /see (ya|you)/i, 'adios'], (payload, chat) => {
	// Matches: goodbye, bye, see ya, see you, adios
	chat.say('Bye, human!');
});
```

**Note** that if a bot is subscribed to both the `message` event using the `.on()` method and a specific keyword using the `.hear()` method, the event will be emitted to both of those subscriptions. If you want to know if a message event was already captured by a different subsciption, you can check for the `data.captured` flag on the callback.

---

### Send API

BootBot provides helper methods for every type of message supported by Facebook's Messenger API. It also provides a generic `sendMessage` method that you can use to send a custom payload. All messages from the Send API return a Promise that you can use to apply actions after a message was successfully sent. You can use this to send consecutive messages and ensure that they're sent in the right order.

#### Important Note:
The Send API methods are shared between the `BootBot`, `Chat` and `Conversation` instances, the only difference is that when you use any of these methods from the `Chat` or `Conversation` instances, you don't have to specify the `userId`.

Example - These two methods are identical:

```javascript
bot.on('message', (payload, chat) => {
  const text = payload.message.text;
  const userId = payload.sender.id;
  bot.say(userId, 'Hello World');
});

// is the same as...

bot.on('message', (payload, chat) => {
  const text = payload.message.text;
  chat.say('Hello World');
});
```

You'll likely use the Send API methods from the `Chat` or `Conversation` instances (ex: `chat.say()` or `convo.say()`), but  you can use them from the `BootBot` instance if you're not in a chat or conversation context (for example, when you want to send a notification to a user).

#### `.say()`

| Method signature |
|:-----------------|
| `chat.say(message, [ options ])` |
| `convo.say(message, [ options ])` |
| `bot.say(userId, message, [ options ])` |

Send a message to the user. The `.say()` method can be used to send text messages, button messages, messages with quick replies or attachments. If you want to send a different type of message (like a generic template), see the Send API method for that specific type of message.

The `message` param can be a string an array, or an object:

- If `message` is a string, the bot will send a text message.
- If `message` is an array, the `.say()` method will be called once for each element in the array.
- If `message` is an object, the message type will depend on the object's format:

```javascript
// Send a text message
chat.say('Hello world!');

// Send a text message with quick replies
chat.say({
	text: 'Favorite color?',
	quickReplies: ['Red', 'Blue', 'Green']
});

// Send a button template
chat.say({
	text: 'Favorite color?',
	buttons: [
		{ type: 'postback', title: 'Red', payload: 'FAVORITE_RED' },
		{ type: 'postback', title: 'Blue', payload: 'FAVORITE_BLUE' },
		{ type: 'postback', title: 'Green', payload: 'FAVORITE_GREEN' }
	]
});

// Send a list template
chat.say({
	elements: [
		{ title: 'Artile 1', image_url: '/path/to/image1.png', default_action: {} },
		{ title: 'Artile 2', image_url: '/path/to/image2.png', default_action: {} }
	],
	buttons: [
		{ type: 'postback', title: 'View More', payload: 'VIEW_MORE' }
	]
});

// Send a generic template
chat.say({
	cards: [
		{ title: 'Card 1', image_url: '/path/to/image1.png', default_action: {} },
		{ title: 'Card 2', image_url: '/path/to/image2.png', default_action: {} }
	]
});

// Send an attachment
chat.say({
	attachment: 'video',
	url: 'http://example.com/video.mp4'
});

// Passing an array will make subsequent calls to the .say() method
// For example, calling:

chat.say(['Hello', 'How are you?']);

// is the same as:

chat.say('Hello').then(() => {
  chat.say('How are you?')
});
```

The `options` param can contain:

| `options` key | Type | Default | Description |
|:--------------|:-----|:--------|:---------|
| `typing` | boolean or number | `false` | Send a typing indicator before sending the message. If set to `true`, it will automatically calculate how long it lasts based on the message length. If it's a number, it will show the typing indicator for that amount of milliseconds (max. `20000` - 20 seconds) |
| `messagingType` | string | `'RESPONSE'` | The messaging type of the message being sent. |
| `notificationType` | string | | Push notification type: `'REGULAR'`: sound/vibration - `'SILENT_PUSH'`: on-screen notification only - `'NO_PUSH'`: no notification. |
| `tag` | string | | The message tag string. Can only be used if `messagingType` is set to `'MESSAGE_TAG'` |
| `onDelivery` | function | | Callback that will be executed when the message is received by the user. Receives params: `(payload, chat, data)` |
| `onRead` | function | | Callback that will be executed when the message is read by the user. Receives params: `(payload, chat, data)` |

#### `.sendTextMessage()`

| Method signature |
|:-----------------|
| `chat.sendTextMessage(text, [ quickReplies, options ])` |
| `convo.sendTextMessage(text, [ quickReplies, options ])` |
| `bot.sendTextMessage(userId, text, [ quickReplies, options ])` |

The `text` param must be a string containing the message to be sent.

The `quickReplies` param can be an array of strings or [quick_reply objects](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/send-api-reference/quick-replies).

The `options` param is identical to the `options` param of the [`.say()`](#say) method.

#### `.sendButtonTemplate()`

| Method signature |
|:-----------------|
| `chat.sendButtonTemplate(text, buttons, [ options ])` |
| `convo.sendButtonTemplate(text, buttons, [ options ])` |
| `bot.sendButtonTemplate(userId, text, buttons, [ options ])` |

The `text` param must be a string containing the message to be sent.

The `buttons` param can be an array of strings or [button objects](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/send-api-reference/button-template).

The `options` param is identical to the `options` param of the [`.say()`](#say) method.

#### `.sendGenericTemplate()`

|:-----------------|
| `chat.sendGenericTemplate(elements, [ options ])` |
| `convo.sendGenericTemplate(elements, [ options ])` |
| `bot.sendGenericTemplate(userId, elements, [ options ])` |

The `elements` param must be an array of [element objects](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/send-api-reference/generic-template).

| `convo.sendTemplate(payload, [ options ])` |
| `bot.sendTemplate(userId, payload, [ options ])` |

Use this method if you want to send a custom template `payload`, like a [receipt template](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/send-api-reference/receipt-template) or an [airline itinerary template](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/send-api-reference/airline-itinerary-template).

The `options` param is identical to the `options` param of the [`.say()`](#say) method.

#### `.sendAttachment()`

| Method signature |
|:-----------------|
| `chat.sendAttachment(type, url, [ quickReplies, options ])` |
| `convo.sendAttachment(type, url, [ quickReplies, options ])` |
| `bot.sendAttachment(userId, type, url, [ quickReplies, options ])` |

The `type` param must be `'image'`, `'audio'`, `'video'` or `'file'`.

The `url` param must be a string with the URL of the attachment.

The `quickReplies` param can be an array of strings or [quick_reply objects](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/send-api-reference/quick-replies).

The `options` param is identical to the `options` param of the [`.say()`](#say) method.

#### `.sendAction()`

| Method signature |
|:-----------------|
| `chat.sendAction(action, [ options ])` |
| `convo.sendAction(action, [ options ])` |
| `bot.sendAction(userId, action, [ options ])` |

The `action` param must be `'mark_seen'`, `'typing_on'` or `'typing_off'`. To send a typing indicator in a more convenient way, see the [`.sendTypingIndicator`](#sendtypingindicator) method.

The `options` param is identical to the `options` param of the [`.say()`](#say) method.

#### `.sendMessage()`

| Method signature |
|:-----------------|
| `chat.sendMessage(message, [ options ])` |
| `convo.sendMessage(message, [ options ])` |
| `bot.sendMessage(userId, message, [ options ])` |

Use this method if you want to send a custom `message` object.

The `options` param is identical to the `options` param of the [`.say()`](#say) method.

#### `.sendTypingIndicator()`

| Method signature |
|:-----------------|
| `chat.sendTypingIndicator(milliseconds)` |
| `convo.sendTypingIndicator(milliseconds)` |
| `bot.sendTypingIndicator(userId, milliseconds)` |

Convinient method to send a `typing_on` action and then a `typing_off` action after `milliseconds` to simulate the bot is actually typing. Max value is 20000 (20 seconds).

You can also use this method via the `typing` option (see [`.say()`](#say) method).

#### `.getUserProfile()`

| Method signature |
|:-----------------|
| `chat.getUserProfile()` |
| `convo.getUserProfile()` |
| `bot.getUserProfile(userId)` |

This method is not technically part of the ""Send"" API, but it's listed here because it's also shared between the `bot`, `chat` and `convo` instances.

Returns a Promise that contains the user's [profile information](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/user-profile).

```javascript
bot.hear('hello', (payload, chat) => {
  chat.getUserProfile().then((user) => {
    chat.say(`Hello, ${user.first_name}!`);
  });
});
```

---

### Conversations

Conversations provide a convinient method to ask questions and handle the user's answer. They're useful when you want to set a flow of different questions/answers, like an onboarding process or when taking an order for example. Conversations also provide a method to save the information that you need from the user's answers, so the interaction is always in context.

Messages sent by the user won't trigger a global `message`, `postback`, `attachment` or `quick_reply` event if there's an active conversation with that user. Answers must be managed by the conversation.

#### `bot.conversation()`

| Method signature |
|:-----------------|
| `chat.conversation(factory)` |
| `bot.conversation(userId, factory)` |

Starts a new conversation with the user.

The `factory` param must be a function that is executed immediately receiving the `convo` instance as it's only param:

```
bot.on('hello', (payload, chat) => {
	chat.conversation((convo) => {
		// convo is available here...
		convo.ask( ... );
	});
});
```

#### `convo.ask(question, answer, [ callbacks, options ])`

| Param | Type | Default | Required |
|:------|:-----|:--------|:---------|
| `question` | string, object or function | | `Y` |
| `answer` | function | | `Y` |
| `callbacks` | array | | `N` |
| `options` | object | | `N` |

If `question` is a string or an object, the `.say()` method will be invoked immediately with that string or object, if it's a function it will also be invoked immedately with the `convo` instance as its only param.

The `answer` param must be a function that receives the `payload`, `convo` and `data` params (similar to the callback function of the `.on()` or `.hear()` methods, except it receives the `convo` instance instead of the `chat` instance). The `answer` function will be called whenever the user replies to the `question` with a text message or quick reply.

The `callbacks` array can be used to listen to specific types of answers to the `question`. You can listen for `postback`, `quick_reply` and `attachment` events, or you can match a specific text `pattern`. See example bellow:

The `options` param is identical to the `options` param of the [`.say()`](#say) method.

##### `convo.ask()` example:

```javascript
const question = {
	text: `What's your favorite color?`,
	quickReplies: ['Red', 'Green', 'Blue']
};

const answer = (payload, convo) => {
	const text = payload.message.text;
	convo.say(`Oh, you like ${text}!`);
};

const callbacks = [
	{
		event: 'quick_reply',
		callback: () => { /* User replied using a quick reply */ }
	},
	{
		event: 'attachment',
		callback: () => { /* User replied with an attachment */ }
	},
	{
		pattern: ['black', 'white'],
		callback: () => { /* User said ""black"" or ""white"" */ }
	}
];

const options = {
	typing: true // Send a typing indicator before asking the question
};

convo.ask(question, answer, callbacks, options);
```

#### `convo.set(property, value)`

| Param | Type | Default | Required |
|:------|:-----|:--------|:---------|
| `property` | string | | `Y` |
| `value` | mixed | | `Y` |

Save a value in the conversation's context. This value will be available in all subsequent questions and answers that are part of this conversation, but the values are lost once the conversation ends.

```javascript
convo.question(`What's your favorite color?`, (payload, convo) => {
	const text = payload.message.text;

	// Save the user's answer in the conversation's context.
	// You can then call convo.get('favoriteColor') in a future question or answer to retrieve the value.
	convo.set('favoriteColor', text);
	convo.say(`Oh, you like ${text}!`);
});
```

#### `convo.get(property)`

| Param | Type | Default | Required |
|:------|:-----|:--------|:---------|
| `property` | string | | `Y` |

Retrieve a value from the conversation's context.

#### `convo.end()`

Ends a conversation, giving control back to the `bot` instance. All `.on()` and `.hear()` listeners are now back in action. After you end a conversation the values that you saved using the `convo.set()` method are now lost.

You must call `convo.end()` after you no longer wish to interpret user's messages as `answer`s to one of your `questions`. If you don't, and a message is received with no `answer` callback listening, the conversation will be ended automatically.

---

### Modules

Modules are simple functions that you can use to organize your code in different files and folders.

#### `.module(factory)`

The `factory` param is a function that gets called immediatly and receives the `bot` instance as its only parameter. For example:

```javascript
// help-module.js
module.exports = (bot) => {
	bot.hear('help', (payload, chat) => {
		// Send Help Menu to the user...
	});
};

// index.js
const helpModule = require('./help-module');
bot.module(helpModule);
```

Take a look at the `examples/module-example.js` file for a complete example.

---

### Messenger Profile API

#### `.setGreetingText(text)`

[Facebook Docs](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/messenger-profile/greeting-text)

| Param | Type | Default | Required |
|:------|:-----|:--------|:---------|
| `text` | string or array | | `Y` |

Set a greeting text for new conversations. The Greeting Text is only rendered the first time the user interacts with a the Page on Messenger.

**Localization support:** `text` can be a string containing the greeting text, or an array of objects to support multiple locales. For more info on the format of these objects, see [the documentation](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/messenger-profile/greeting-text).

#### `.setGetStartedButton(action)`

[Facebook Docs](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/messenger-profile/get-started-button)

| Param | Type | Default | Required |
|:------|:-----|:--------|:---------|
| `action` | string or function | | `Y` |

React to a user starting a conversation with the bot by clicking the Get Started button. If `action` is a string, the Get Started button postback will be set to that string. If it's a function, that callback will be executed when a user clicks the Get Started button.

#### `.deleteGetStartedButton()`

Removes the Get Started button call to action.

#### `.setPersistentMenu(buttons, [ disableInput ])`

[Facebook Docs](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/messenger-profile/persistent-menu)

| Param | Type | Default | Required |
|:------|:-----|:--------|:---------|
| `buttons` | array of strings or objects | | `Y` |
| `disableInput ` | boolean | `false` | `N` |

Creates a Persistent Menu that is available at any time during the conversation. The `buttons` param can be an array of strings, button objects, or locale objects.

If `disableInput` is set to `true`, it will disable user input in the menu. The user will only be able to interact with the bot via the menu, postbacks, buttons and webviews.

**Localization support:** if `buttons` is an array of objects containing a `locale` attribute, it will be used as-is, expecting it to be an array of localized menues. For more info on the format of these objects, see [the documentation](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/messenger-profile/persistent-menu).

#### `.deletePersistentMenu()`

Removes the Persistent Menu.

----------------------

### Bypassing Express

You may only want to use bootbot for the Facebook related config and the simple to use Send API features but handle routing from somewhere else. Or there may be times where you want to send a message out of band, like if you get a postback callback and need to end a conversation flow immediately.

Or maybe you don't want to use express but a different HTTP server.

#### `.handleFacebookData(data)`

Use this to send a message from a parsed webhook message directly to your bot.

```js
const linuxNewsBot   = new BootBot({argz});
const appleNewsBot   = new BootBot({argz});
const windowsNewsBot = new BootBot({argz});

myNonExpressRouter.post(""/mywebhook"", (data) => {
	const messages = data.entry[0].messaging;
	messages.forEach(message => {
		switch(data.entry.id) {
			case LINUX_BOT_PAGE_ID:
				linuxNewsBot.handleFacebookData(message);
				break;
			case APPLE_BOT_PAGE_ID:
				appleNewsBot.handleFacebookData(message);
				break;
			// ...
		};
	});
});
```

**[How to contribute](https://github.com/pocheshire/BottomNavigationBar/blob/master/README.md#contributions)**

[Common problems and solutions](https://github.com/pocheshire/BottomNavigationBar/blob/master/README.md#common-problems-and-solutions)

## What?
[BottomBar](https://github.com/roughike/BottomBar) ported to C#

A custom view component that mimics the new [Material Design Bottom Navigation pattern](https://www.google.com/design/spec/components/bottom-navigation.html).

## NuGet package

Yes! It's currently available like [BottomNavigationBar](https://www.nuget.org/packages/BottomNavigationBar) package.

## Xamarin Forms

Yes! Thanks [Thrive GmbH](https://github.com/thrive-now) for  [BottomNavigationBarXF](https://github.com/thrive-now/BottomNavigationBarXF) implementation.

## MinSDK version

The current minSDK version is **API level 11 (Honeycomb).**

## How?

You can add items by specifying an array of items or **by xml menu resources**.

#### Adding items from menu resource

**res/menu/bottombar_menu.xml:**

```xml
<menu xmlns:android=""http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"">
    <item
        android:id=""@+id/bottomBarItemOne""
        android:icon=""@drawable/ic_recents""
        android:title=""Recents"" />
        ...
</menu>
```

**MainActivity.cs**

```csharp
public class MainActivity : AppCompatActivity, BottomNavigationBar.Listeners.IOnMenuTabSelectedListener
{
    private BottomBar _bottomBar;
    
    protected override void OnCreate(Bundle bundle)
    {
        base.OnCreate(bundle);

        SetContentView(Resource.Layout.MainActivity);

        _bottomBar = BottomBar.Attach(this, bundle);
        _bottomBar.SetItems(Resource.Menu.bottombar_menu);
        _bottomBar.SetOnMenuTabClickListener (this);
        
        // Setting colors for different tabs when there's more than three of them.
        // You can set colors for tabs in three different ways as shown below.
        _bottomBar.MapColorForTab(0, ContextCompat.GetColor(this, Resource.Color.colorAccent));
        _bottomBar.MapColorForTab(1, 0xFF5D4037);
        _bottomBar.MapColorForTab(2, ""#7B1FA2"");
        _bottomBar.MapColorForTab(3, ""#FF5252"");
        _bottomBar.MapColorForTab(4, ""#FF9800"");
    }
    
    public void OnMenuItemSelected(int menuItemId)
    {
        
    }

    protected override void OnSaveInstanceState(Bundle outState)
    {
        base.OnSaveInstanceState(outState);

        // Necessary to restore the BottomBar's state, otherwise we would
        // lose the current tab on orientation change.
        _bottomBar.OnSaveInstanceState(outState);
    }
}
```

## Badges

You can easily add badges for showing an unread message count or new items / whatever you like.

```csharp
// Make a Badge for the first tab, with red background color and a value of ""13"".
BottomBarBadge unreadMessages = _bottomBar.MakeBadgeForTabAt(0, ""#FF0000"", 13);

// Control the badge's visibility
unreadMessages.Show();
unreadMessages.Hide();

// Change the displayed count for this badge.
unreadMessages.Count = 4;

// Change the show / hide animation duration.
unreadMessages.AnimationDuration = 200;

// If you want the badge be shown always after unselecting the tab that contains it.
unreadMessages.AutoShowAfterUnSelection = true;
```

## Customization

```csharp
// Disable the left bar on tablets and behave exactly the same on mobile and tablets instead.
_bottomBar.NoTabletGoodness();

// Show all titles even when there's more than three tabs.
mBottomBar.UseFixedMode();

// Use the dark theme
_bottomBar.UseDarkTheme();

// Set the color for the active tab. Ignored on mobile when there are more than three tabs.
_bottomBar.SetActiveTabColor(""#009688"");

// Use custom text appearance in tab titles.
_bottomBar.SetTextAppearance(Resource.Style.MyTextAppearance);

// Use custom typeface that's located at the ""/src/main/assets"" directory. If using with
// custom text appearance, set the text appearance first.
_bottomBar.SetTypeFace(""MyFont.ttf"");
```

#### What about hiding it automatically on scroll?

**MainActivity.cs:**

```csharp
// Instead of attach(), use attachShy:
_bottomBar = BottomBar.AttachShy((CoordinatorLayout) FindViewById(Resource.Id.myCoordinator), 
    FindViewById(Resource.Id.myScrollingContent), savedInstanceState);
```

**activity_main.xml:**

```xml
<android.support.design.widget.CoordinatorLayout xmlns:android=""http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android""
    android:id=""@+id/myCoordinator""
    android:layout_width=""match_parent""
    android:layout_height=""match_parent""
    android:fitsSystemWindows=""true"">

    <android.support.v4.widget.NestedScrollView
        android:id=""@+id/myScrollingContent""
        android:layout_width=""match_parent""
        android:layout_height=""match_parent"">

        <!-- Your loooong scrolling content here -->

    </android.support.v4.widget.NestedScrollView>

</android.support.design.widget.CoordinatorLayout>
```

#### I don't want to set items from a menu resource!

That's alright, you can also do it the hard way if you like living on the edge.

```csharp
// If you use normal Fragments, just change the first argument to FragmentManager
_bottomBar.SetItems(
    new BottomBarTab(Resource.Drawable.ic_recents, ""Recents""),
    new BottomBarTab(Resource.Drawable.ic_favorites, ""Favorites""),
    new BottomBarTab(Resource.Drawable.ic_nearby, ""Nearby"")
);
```

For a working example, refer to [the sample app](https://github.com/pocheshire/BottomNavigationBar/tree/master/src/sample).

## Common problems and solutions

#### Can I use it by XML?

No, but you can still put it anywhere in the View hierarchy. Just attach it to any View you want like this:

```csharp
_bottomBar.Attach(FindViewById(Resource.Id.myContent), savedInstanceState);
```

#### Why does the top of my content have sooooo much empty space?!

Probably because you're doing some next-level advanced Android stuff (such as using CoordinatorLayout and ```fitsSystemWindows=""true""```) and the normal paddings for the content are too much. Add this right after calling ```Attach()```:

```csharp
_bottomBar.NoTopOffset();
```

#### I don't like the awesome transparent Navigation Bar!

You can disable it.

```csharp
_bottomBar.NoNavBarGoodness();
```

#### Why is it overlapping my Navigation Drawer?

All you need to do is instead of attaching the BottomBar to your Activity, attach it to the view that has your content. For example, if your fragments are in a ViewGroup that has the id ```fragmentContainer```, you would do something like this:

```csharp
_bottomBar.Attach(FindViewById(Resource.Id.fragmentContainer), savedInstanceState);
```

#### The fancy colour changing background animation isn't working!
By default, BottomBar only starts to use the specified `MapColorForTab` value for the BottomBar background if you have more than three tabs. If you want to enable this functionality for tab bars with three items or less, do the following before you add any items to the BottomBar:

```csharp
_bottomBar.MaxFixedTabCount = n-1;
```

(where n is the number of tabs: so, if you have a BottomBar with 3 items, you would call `MaxFixedTabCount = 2;`)

#### What about Tablets?

It works nicely with tablets straight out of the box. When the library detects that the user has a tablet, the BottomBar will become a ""LeftBar"", just like [in the Material Design Guidelines](https://material-design.storage.googleapis.com/publish/material_v_4/material_ext_publish/0B3321sZLoP_HSTd3UFY2aEp2ZDg/components_bottomnavigation_usage2.png).

### Original Repository

The main working part was taken from [Megatron](https://github.com/eyaadh/megadlbot_oss) and thanks to [eyaadh](https://github.com/eyaadh) for his awesome project.

## How to make your own

Either you could locally host or deploy on [Heroku](https://heroku.com)

### Deploy on Heroku

Press the below button to fast deploy to Heroku

- [![Deploy To Heroku](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://github.com/eyMarv/ultraMarv-roku)

then goto the <a href=""#mandatory-vars"">variables tab</a> for more info on setting up environmental variables.

### Host it on VPS or Locally

```sh
git clone https://github.com/EverythingSuckz/TG-FileStreamBot
cd TG-FileStreamBot
virtualenv -p /usr/bin/python3 venv
. ./venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 -m WebStreamer
```

and to stop the whole bot,
 do <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd>

## Setting up things

If you're on Heroku, just add these in the Environmental Variables
or if you're Locally hosting, create a file named `.env` in the root directory and add all the variables there.
An example of `.env` file:

```sh
API_ID=452525
API_HASH=esx576f8738x883f3sfzx83
BOT_TOKEN=55838383:yourtbottokenhere
MULTI_CLIENT=True
MULTI_TOKEN1=55838383:yourfirstmulticlientbottokenhere
MULTI_TOKEN2=55838383:yoursecondmulticlientbottokenhere
MULTI_TOKEN3=55838383:yourthirdmulticlientbottokenhere
BIN_CHANNEL=-100
PORT=8080
FQDN=yourserverip
HAS_SSL=False
```

### Mandatory Vars

`API_ID` : Goto [my.telegram.org](https://my.telegram.org) to obtain this.

`API_HASH` : Goto [my.telegram.org](https://my.telegram.org) to obtain this.

`BOT_TOKEN` : Get the bot token from [@BotFather](https://telegram.dog/BotFather)

`BIN_CHANNEL` : Create a new channel (private/public), post something in your channel. Forward that post to [@missrose_bot](https://telegram.dog/MissRose_bot) and **reply** `\id`. Now copy paste the forwarded channel ID in this field. 

### For MultiClient

`MULTI_TOKEN1`: Add your first bot token here.

`MULTI_TOKEN2`: Add your second bot token here.

you may also add as many as bots you want. (max limit is not tested yet)
`MULTI_TOKEN3`, `MULTI_TOKEN4`, etc.

### Optional Vars

`SLEEP_THRESHOLD` : Set a sleep threshold for flood wait exceptions happening globally in this telegram bot instance, below which any request that raises a flood wait will be automatically invoked again after sleeping for the required amount of time. Flood wait exceptions requiring higher waiting times will be raised. Defaults to 60 seconds.

`WORKERS` : Number of maximum concurrent workers for handling incoming updates. Defaults to `3`

`PORT` : The port that you want your webapp to be listened to. Defaults to `8080`

`WEB_SERVER_BIND_ADDRESS` : Your server bind address. Defauls to `0.0.0.0`

`NO_PORT` : (can be either `True` or `False`) If you don't want your port to be displayed. You should point your `PORT` to `80` (http) or `443` (https) for the links to work. Ignore this if you're on Heroku.

`FQDN` :  A Fully Qualified Domain Name if present. Defaults to `WEB_SERVER_BIND_ADDRESS`

`HAS_SSL` : (can be either `True` or `False`) If you want the generated links in https format.

`PING_INTERVAL` : The time in ms you want the servers to be pinged each time to avoid sleeping (Only for Heroku). Defaults to `1200` or 20 minutes.
## How to use the bot

:warning: **Before using the  bot, don't forget to add all the bots (multi-client ones too) to the `BIN_CHANNEL` as an admin**
 
`/start` : To check if the bot is alive or not.

To get an instant stream link, just forward any media to the bot and boom, its fast af.

## faQ

- How long the links will remain valid or is there any expiration time for the links generated by the bot?
> The links will will be valid as longs as your bot is alive and you haven't deleted the log channel.

Built on top of the Slack API [github.com/slack-go/slack](https://github.com/slack-go/slack) with the idea to simplify the Real-Time Messaging feature to easily create Slack Bots, assign commands to them and extract parameters.

## Features

- Supports Slack Apps using [Socket Mode](https://api.slack.com/apis/connections/socket)
- Easy definitions of commands and their input
- Available bot initialization, errors and default handlers
- Simple parsing of String, Integer, Float and Boolean parameters
- Contains support for `context.Context`
- Built-in `help` command
- Replies can be new messages or in threads
- Supports authorization
- Bot responds to mentions and direct messages
- Handlers run concurrently via goroutines
- Produces events for executed commands
- Full access to the Slack API [github.com/slack-go/slack](https://github.com/slack-go/slack)

## Dependencies

- `commander` [github.com/shomali11/commander](https://github.com/shomali11/commander)
- `slack` [github.com/slack-go/slack](https://github.com/slack-go/slack)

# Install

```
go get github.com/shomali11/slacker
```

# Preparing your Slack App

To use Slacker you'll need to create a Slack App, either [manually](#manual-steps) or with an [app manifest](#app-manifest). The app manifest feature is easier, but is a beta feature from Slack and thus may break/change without much notice.

## Manual Steps

Slacker works by communicating with the Slack [Events API](https://api.slack.com/apis/connections/events-api) using the [Socket Mode](https://api.slack.com/apis/connections/socket) connection protocol.

To get started, you must have or create a [Slack App](https://api.slack.com/apps?new_app=1) and enable `Socket Mode`, which will generate your app token (`SLACK_APP_TOKEN` in the examples) that will be needed to authenticate.

Additionally, you need to subscribe to events for your bot to respond to under the `Event Subscriptions` section. Common event subscriptions for bots include `app_mention` or `message.im`.

After setting up your subscriptions, add scopes necessary to your bot in the `OAuth & Permissions`. The following scopes are recommended for getting started, though you may need to add/remove scopes depending on your bots purpose:

* `app_mentions:read`
* `channels:history`
* `chat:write`
* `groups:history`
* `im:history`
* `mpim:history`

Once you've selected your scopes install your app to the workspace and navigate back to the `OAuth & Permissions` section. Here you can retrieve yor bot's OAuth token (`SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` in the examples) from the top of the page.

With both tokens in hand, you can now proceed with the examples below.

## App Manifest

Slack [App Manifests](https://api.slack.com/reference/manifests) make it easy to share a app configurations. We provide a [simple manifest](./examples/app_manifest/manifest.yml) that should work with all the examples provided below.

The manifest provided will send all messages in channels your bot is in to the bot (including DMs) and not just ones that actually mention them in the message.

If you wish to only have your bot respond to messages they are directly messaged in, you will need to add the `app_mentions:read` scope, and remove:

- `im:history`       # single-person dm
- `mpim:history`     # multi-person dm
- `channels:history` # public channels
- `groups:history`   # private channels

You'll also need to adjust the event subscriptions, adding `app_mention` and removing:

- `message.channels`
- `message.groups`
- `message.im`
- `message.mpim`

# Examples

## Example 1

Defining a command using slacker

```go
package main

import (
	""context""
	""log""
	""os""

	""github.com/shomali11/slacker""
)

func main() {
	bot := slacker.NewClient(os.Getenv(""SLACK_BOT_TOKEN""), os.Getenv(""SLACK_APP_TOKEN""))

	definition := &slacker.CommandDefinition{
		Handler: func(botCtx slacker.BotContext, request slacker.Request, response slacker.ResponseWriter) {
			response.Reply(""pong"")
		},
	}

	bot.Command(""ping"", definition)

	ctx, cancel := context.WithCancel(context.Background())
	defer cancel()

	err := bot.Listen(ctx)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
}
```

## Example 2

Defining a command with an optional description and example. The handler replies to a thread.

```go
package main

import (
	""context""
	""log""
	""os""

	""github.com/shomali11/slacker""
)

func main() {
	bot := slacker.NewClient(os.Getenv(""SLACK_BOT_TOKEN""), os.Getenv(""SLACK_APP_TOKEN""))

	definition := &slacker.CommandDefinition{
		Description: ""Ping!"",
		Example:     ""ping"",
		Handler: func(botCtx slacker.BotContext, request slacker.Request, response slacker.ResponseWriter) {
			response.Reply(""pong"", slacker.WithThreadReply(true))
		},
	}

	bot.Command(""ping"", definition)

	ctx, cancel := context.WithCancel(context.Background())
	defer cancel()

	err := bot.Listen(ctx)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
}
```

## Example 3

Defining a command with a parameter

```go
package main

import (
	""context""
	""log""
	""os""

	""github.com/shomali11/slacker""
)

func main() {
	bot := slacker.NewClient(os.Getenv(""SLACK_BOT_TOKEN""), os.Getenv(""SLACK_APP_TOKEN""))

	definition := &slacker.CommandDefinition{
		Description: ""Echo a word!"",
		Example:     ""echo hello"",
		Handler: func(botCtx slacker.BotContext, request slacker.Request, response slacker.ResponseWriter) {
			word := request.Param(""word"")
			response.Reply(word)
		},
	}

	bot.Command(""echo <word>"", definition)

	ctx, cancel := context.WithCancel(context.Background())
	defer cancel()

	err := bot.Listen(ctx)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
}
```

## Example 4

Defining a command with two parameters. Parsing one as a string and the other as an integer.
_(The second parameter is the default value in case no parameter was passed or could not parse the value)_

```go
package main

import (
	""context""
	""log""
	""os""

	""github.com/shomali11/slacker""
)

func main() {
	bot := slacker.NewClient(os.Getenv(""SLACK_BOT_TOKEN""), os.Getenv(""SLACK_APP_TOKEN""))

	definition := &slacker.CommandDefinition{
		Description: ""Repeat a word a number of times!"",
		Example:     ""repeat hello 10"",
		Handler: func(botCtx slacker.BotContext, request slacker.Request, response slacker.ResponseWriter) {
			word := request.StringParam(""word"", ""Hello!"")
			number := request.IntegerParam(""number"", 1)
			for i := 0; i < number; i++ {
				response.Reply(word)
			}
		},
	}

	bot.Command(""repeat <word> <number>"", definition)

	ctx, cancel := context.WithCancel(context.Background())
	defer cancel()

	err := bot.Listen(ctx)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
}
```

## Example 5

Defines two commands that display sending errors to the Slack channel. One that replies as a new message. The other replies to the thread.

```go
package main

import (
	""context""
	""errors""
	""log""
	""os""

	""github.com/shomali11/slacker""
)

func main() {
	bot := slacker.NewClient(os.Getenv(""SLACK_BOT_TOKEN""), os.Getenv(""SLACK_APP_TOKEN""))

	messageReplyDefinition := &slacker.CommandDefinition{
		Description: ""Tests errors in new messages"",
		Handler: func(botCtx slacker.BotContext, request slacker.Request, response slacker.ResponseWriter) {
			response.ReportError(errors.New(""Oops!""))
		},
	}

	threadReplyDefinition := &slacker.CommandDefinition{
		Description: ""Tests errors in threads"",
		Handler: func(botCtx slacker.BotContext, request slacker.Request, response slacker.ResponseWriter) {
			response.ReportError(errors.New(""Oops!""), slacker.WithThreadError(true))
		},
	}

	bot.Command(""message"", messageReplyDefinition)
	bot.Command(""thread"", threadReplyDefinition)

	ctx, cancel := context.WithCancel(context.Background())
	defer cancel()

	err := bot.Listen(ctx)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
}
```

)

func main() {
	bot := slacker.NewClient(os.Getenv(""SLACK_BOT_TOKEN""), os.Getenv(""SLACK_APP_TOKEN""))

	definition := &slacker.CommandDefinition{
		Description: ""Upload a word!"",
		Handler: func(botCtx slacker.BotContext, request slacker.Request, response slacker.ResponseWriter) {
			word := request.Param(""word"")
			client := botCtx.Client()
			ev := botCtx.Event()

			if ev.Channel != """" {
				client.PostMessage(ev.Channel, slack.MsgOptionText(""Uploading file ..."", false))
				_, err := client.UploadFile(slack.FileUploadParameters{Content: word, Channels: []string{ev.Channel}})
				if err != nil {
					fmt.Printf(""Error encountered when uploading file: %+v\n"", err)

}

func contains(list []string, element string) bool {
	for _, value := range list {
		if value == element {
			return true
		}
	}
	return false
}
```

## Example 13

Adding handlers to when the bot is connected, encounters an error and a default for when none of the commands match

```go
package main

import (
	""log""
	""os""

	""context""
	""fmt""

	""github.com/shomali11/slacker""
)

func main() {
	bot := slacker.NewClient(os.Getenv(""SLACK_BOT_TOKEN""), os.Getenv(""SLACK_APP_TOKEN""))

	bot.Init(func() {
		log.Println(""Connected!"")
	})

	bot.Err(func(err string) {
		log.Println(err)
	})

	bot.DefaultCommand(func(botCtx slacker.BotContext, request slacker.Request, response slacker.ResponseWriter) {
		response.Reply(""Say what?"")
	})

	bot.DefaultEvent(func(event interface{}) {
		fmt.Println(event)
	})

	definition := &slacker.CommandDefinition{
		Description: ""help!"",
		Handler: func(botCtx slacker.BotContext, request slacker.Request, response slacker.ResponseWriter) {
			response.Reply(""Your own help function..."")
		},
	}

	bot.Help(definition)

	ctx, cancel := context.WithCancel(context.Background())
	defer cancel()

	err := bot.Listen(ctx)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
}
```

## Example 14

Listening to the Commands Events being produced

```go
package main

import (
	""fmt""
	""log""
	""os""

	""context""

	""github.com/shomali11/slacker""
)

func printCommandEvents(analyticsChannel <-chan *slacker.CommandEvent) {
	for event := range analyticsChannel {
		fmt.Println(""Command Events"")
		fmt.Println(event.Timestamp)
		fmt.Println(event.Command)
		fmt.Println(event.Parameters)
		fmt.Println(event.Event)
		fmt.Println()
	}
}

func main() {
	bot := slacker.NewClient(os.Getenv(""SLACK_BOT_TOKEN""), os.Getenv(""SLACK_APP_TOKEN""))

	go printCommandEvents(bot.CommandEvents())

	bot.Command(""ping"", &slacker.CommandDefinition{
		Handler: func(botCtx slacker.BotContext, request slacker.Request, response slacker.ResponseWriter) {
			response.Reply(""pong"")
		},
	})

	bot.Command(""echo <word>"", &slacker.CommandDefinition{
		Description: ""Echo a word!"",
		Example:     ""echo hello"",
		Handler: func(botCtx slacker.BotContext, request slacker.Request, response slacker.ResponseWriter) {
			word := request.Param(""word"")
			response.Reply(word)
		},
	})

	ctx, cancel := context.WithCancel(context.Background())
	defer cancel()

	err := bot.Listen(ctx)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
}
```

## Example 15

Slack interaction example

```go
package main

import (
	""context""
	""github.com/shomali11/slacker""
	""github.com/slack-go/slack""
	""github.com/slack-go/slack/socketmode""
	""log""
	""os""
)

func main() {
	bot := slacker.NewClient(os.Getenv(""SLACK_BOT_TOKEN""), os.Getenv(""SLACK_APP_TOKEN""))

	bot.Interactive(func(s *slacker.Slacker, event *socketmode.Event, callback *slack.InteractionCallback) {
		if callback.Type != slack.InteractionTypeBlockActions {
			return
		}

		if len(callback.ActionCallback.BlockActions) != 1 {
			return
		}

		action := callback.ActionCallback.BlockActions[0]
		if action.BlockID != ""mood-block"" {
			return
		}

		var text string
		switch action.ActionID {
		case ""happy"":
			text = ""I'm happy to hear you are happy!""
		case ""sad"":
			text = ""I'm sorry to hear you are sad.""
		default:
			text = ""I don't understand your mood...""
		}

		_, _, _ = s.Client().PostMessage(callback.Channel.ID, slack.MsgOptionText(text, false),
			slack.MsgOptionReplaceOriginal(callback.ResponseURL))

		s.SocketMode().Ack(*event.Request)
	})

	definition := &slacker.CommandDefinition{
		Handler: func(botCtx slacker.BotContext, request slacker.Request, response slacker.ResponseWriter) {
			happyBtn := slack.NewButtonBlockElement(""happy"", ""true"", slack.NewTextBlockObject(""plain_text"", ""Happy 🙂"", true, false))
			happyBtn.Style = ""primary""
			sadBtn := slack.NewButtonBlockElement(""sad"", ""false"", slack.NewTextBlockObject(""plain_text"", ""Sad ☹️"", true, false))
			sadBtn.Style = ""danger""

			err := response.Reply("""", slacker.WithBlocks([]slack.Block{
				slack.NewSectionBlock(slack.NewTextBlockObject(slack.PlainTextType, ""What is your mood today?"", true, false), nil, nil),
				slack.NewActionBlock(""mood-block"", happyBtn, sadBtn),
			}))
			if err != nil {
				panic(err)
			}
		},
	}

	bot.Command(""mood"", definition)

	ctx, cancel := context.WithCancel(context.Background())
	defer cancel()

	err := bot.Listen(ctx)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
}
```

## Example 16

Configure bot to process other bot events

```go
package main

import (
        ""context""
        ""log""
        ""os""

        ""github.com/shomali11/slacker""
)

func main() {
        bot := slacker.NewClient(
                os.Getenv(""SLACK_BOT_TOKEN""),
                os.Getenv(""SLACK_APP_TOKEN""),
                slacker.WithBotInteractionMode(slacker.BotInteractionModeIgnoreApp),
        )

        bot.Command(""hello"", &slacker.CommandDefinition{
                Handler: func(botCtx slacker.BotContext, request slacker.Request, response slacker.ResponseWriter) {
                        response.Reply(""hai!"")
                },
        })

        ctx, cancel := context.WithCancel(context.Background())
        defer cancel()

        err := bot.Listen(ctx)
        if err != nil {
                log.Fatal(err)
        }
}
```

## Example 17

Override the default event input cleaning function (to sanitize the messages received by Slacker)

```
package main

import (
        ""context""
        ""log""
        ""os""
	""fmt""
	""strings""

        ""github.com/shomali11/slacker""
)

func main() {
	bot := slacker.NewClient(os.Getenv(""SLACK_BOT_TOKEN""), os.Getenv(""SLACK_APP_TOKEN""), slacker.WithDebug(true))
	bot.CleanEventInput(func(in string) string {
		fmt.Println(""My slack bot does not like backticks!"")
		return strings.ReplaceAll(in, ""`"", """")
	})

        bot.Command(""my-command"", &slacker.CommandDefinition{
                Handler: func(botCtx slacker.BotContext, request slacker.Request, response slacker.ResponseWriter) {
                        response.Reply(""it works!"")
                },
        })

        ctx, cancel := context.WithCancel(context.Background())
        defer cancel()

        err := bot.Listen(ctx)
        if err != nil {
                log.Fatal(err)
        }
}
```

# Troubleshooting

## My bot is not responding to events

There are a few common issues that can cause this:

* The OAuth (bot) Token may be incorrect. In this case authentication does not fail like it does if the App Token is incorrect, and the bot will simply have no scopes and be unable to respond.
* Required scopes are missing from the OAuth (bot) Token. Similar to the incorrect OAuth Token, without the necessary scopes, the bot cannot respond.
* The bot does not have the correct event subscriptions setup, and is not receiving events to respond to.

315,315,iterativv/NostalgiaForInfinity,Python,"# NostalgiaForInfinity
Trading strategy for the [Freqtrade](https://www.freqtrade.io) crypto bot. For backtesting results, check out the comments in the individual [commit](https://github.com/iterativv/NostalgiaForInfinity/commits/main) page.

## Clone The Repository
If you plan to only clone the repository to use the strategy, a regular ``git clone`` will do.

However, if you plan on running additional strategies or run the test suite, you need to clone
the repository and it's submodules.

### Newer versions of Git

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/iterativv/NostalgiaForInfinity.git checkout-path
```

### Older versions of Git

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/iterativv/NostalgiaForInfinity.git checkout-path
```

### Existing Checkouts
```
git submodule update --remote --checkout
```


## Change strategy

Add strategies to the [user_data/strategies](user_data/strategies) folder and also in the [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml) file at `strategy-list` add your strategy in the list.

[Additional Information : NFINext is a older strategy on 5m tf , NFI-NG is a 15m tf stategy abandoned mid development , NFIX is the currently developed strategy (a rework of NG on 5m tf)]

## General Recommendations

For optimal performance, suggested to use between 4 and 6 open trades, with unlimited stake.

A pairlist with 40 to 80 pairs. Volume pairlist works well.

Prefer stable coin (USDT, BUSD etc) pairs, instead of BTC or ETH pairs.

Highly recommended to blacklist leveraged tokens (*BULL, *BEAR, *UP, *DOWN etc).

Ensure that you don't override any variables in you config.json. Especially the timeframe (must be 5m).

* `use_sell_signal` must set to true (or not set at all).
* `sell_profit_only` must set to false (or not set at all).
* `ignore_roi_if_buy_signal` must set to true (or not set at all).

## Donations

Absolutely not required. However, will be accepted as a token of appreciation.

* BTC: `bc1qvflsvddkmxh7eqhc4jyu5z5k6xcw3ay8jl49sk`
* ETH (ERC20): `0x83D3cFb8001BDC5d2211cBeBB8cB3461E5f7Ec91`
* BEP20/BSC (USDT, ETH, BNB, ...): `0x86A0B21a20b39d16424B7c8003E4A7e12d78ABEe`

# BottomNavigationBar
Material design 更新的BottomNavigationbar的开源实现

目前版本最新版本是v0.3，还在努力完善中，有兴趣的朋友可以关注。如果发现问题请写在issue，我会定期查看和修复。

###version

v0.1 基础版本

v0.2 支持修改tab selected 情况下的width scale 属性

v0.3 支持设置tab text 在unselected情况下是否隐藏

###Demo修改
有童鞋反应说要如何实现像新规范里面NavigationBar透明的样式，所以这里把项目的Demo修改一下，实现Navigationbar透明并且覆盖在BottomNavigationBar上面。（目前这种实现方式还不够完善，会导致statusBar也不占位的问题。如果有网友有更好的实现方式，不妨提出来，大家一起探讨和分享。）
ps:最近碰上公司项目比较赶，所以暂停了BottomNavigationBar的开源进度。

具体实现：
demo基础上

        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);
        if (Build.VERSION.SDK_INT >= Build.VERSION_CODES.KITKAT) {
            Window window = getWindow();
            // Translucent status bar
            window.setFlags(
                    WindowManager.LayoutParams.FLAG_TRANSLUCENT_STATUS,
                    WindowManager.LayoutParams.FLAG_TRANSLUCENT_STATUS);
            // Translucent navigation bar
            window.setFlags(
                    WindowManager.LayoutParams.FLAG_TRANSLUCENT_NAVIGATION,
                    WindowManager.LayoutParams.FLAG_TRANSLUCENT_NAVIGATION);
        }
去掉所有的xml中的所有android:fitsSystemWindows=""true""

    <android.support.design.widget.AppBarLayout
        android:layout_width=""match_parent""
        android:layout_height=""wrap_content""
        android:theme=""@style/AppTheme.AppBarOverlay"">

        <View
            android:layout_width=""match_parent""
            android:layout_height=""24dp""/>

        <android.support.v7.widget.Toolbar
            android:id=""@+id/toolbar""
            android:layout_width=""match_parent""
            android:layout_height=""?attr/actionBarSize""
            android:background=""#33000000""
            app:layout_scrollFlags=""scroll""
            app:popupTheme=""@style/AppTheme.PopupOverlay""/>

    </android.support.design.widget.AppBarLayout>

#####补个图

 ![image](https://github.com/RoyWallace/BottomNavigationBar/blob/master/gif/v0.3.1.gif?raw=true)


###TODO

 支持 bar background 不随tab选中而变化
 支持 tab textColor selector


[bottom navigation bars的规范在这里](https://www.google.com/design/spec/components/bottom-navigation.html)

###Show

####How to use
[![](https://jitpack.io/v/RoyWallace/BottomNavigationBar.svg)](https://jitpack.io/#RoyWallace/BottomNavigationBar)

**Step 1**. Add the JitPack repository to your build file
Add it in your root build.gradle at the end of repositories:

    allprojects {
        repositories {
            ...
            maven { url ""https://jitpack.io"" }
        }
    }
**Step 2.** Add the dependency

    dependencies {
            compile 'com.github.RoyWallace:BottomNavigationBar:v0.1'
    }

**Step 3.**  use it in your layout xml

    <etong.bottomnavigation.lib.BottomNavigationBar
        android:id=""@+id/bottomLayout""
        android:layout_width=""match_parent""
        android:layout_height=""?attr/actionBarSize""
        android:layout_gravity=""bottom""/>
**Step 4.** add tab and tabSelected listener

    bottomLayout = (BottomNavigationBar) findViewById(R.id.bottomLayout);
    //params: int icon,String text,int color
    bottomLayout.addTab(R.mipmap.ic_local_movies_white_48dp, ""Movies & Tv"", 0xff4a5965);
    bottomLayout.setOnTabListener(new BottomNavigationBar.TabListener() {
        @Override
        public void onSelected(int position) {
            //...
        }
    });
and you can also use the **BottomNavigationBehavior** with **CoordinatorLayout** 

    <etong.bottomnavigation.lib.BottomNavigationBar
        android:id=""@+id/bottomLayout""
        android:layout_width=""match_parent""
        android:layout_height=""?attr/actionBarSize""
        android:layout_gravity=""bottom""
        app:layout_behavior=""etong.bottomnavigation.lib.BottomNavigationBehavior""/>

####Set tab selected width( bottomLayout.setTabWidthSelectedScale(1.5f);
####Set tab text default visible
    bottomLayout.setTextDefaultVisible(true);

Optionally, you can give your app a name, or instead leave
it blank and let Heroku name it for you (you can change it later).

![Success](https://i.groupme.com/959x932.png.85e7959a8a9a41c6b20f5f6b50aceecb)


## Next, create a GroupMe Bot:

Go to:
https://dev.groupme.com/session/new

Use your GroupMe credentials to log into the developer site.

![Log into dev.groupme.com](https://i.groupme.com/640x292.png.38c9e590383149c1a01424fc61cdce4e)

Once you have successfully logged in, go to https://dev.groupme.com/bots/new

![Create your new bot](http://i.groupme.com/567x373.png.242d18352d7742858cf9a263f597c5d9)

Fill out the form to create your new bot:

  * Select the group where you want the bot to live
  * Give your bot a name
  * Paste in the url to your newly deply heroku app
    * `http://your-app-name-here.herokuapp.com/`
  * (Optional) Give your bot an avatar by providing a url to an image
  * Click submit

## Find your Bot ID:<a name=""get-bot-id""></a>

Go here to view all of your bots:
https://dev.groupme.com/bots

Click on the one you just created.

![Select your new bot](http://i.groupme.com/871x333.png.5a33ef2b6ab74ea59d5aaa5569aaaf23)

On your Bot's page, copy the Bot ID

![Copy your Bot ID](http://i.groupme.com/615x295.png.3256190e86ed4cd7ae6cf09899c1f9a8)

## Add your Bot ID to your Heroku app:

Go here to see all of your Heroku apps and select the one you just created before:

https://dashboard-next.heroku.com/apps

![Select your heroku app](http://i.groupme.com/920x722.png.46154d6b95f249539c594b129ddb7732)

On your app page, click settings in the top navigation:

![Go to your app's settings](http://i.groupme.com/722x127.png.27c0a2e83c524064bd41bb66df76d14c)

On your app's setting page, find the Config Vars section and click the Reveal Config Vars button:

![Reveal your environment variables](http://i.groupme.com/606x181.png.94d5157963bc419886e98e038e3195c3)

Then click edit:

![Edit your environment variables](http://i.groupme.com/796x212.png.b8979454fc4742c7bae688ac67262755)

Fill out the form to add an environment variable to your app:

  * In the ""key"" field type: BOT_ID
  * In the ""value"" field paste your Bot ID that you copied in the previous steps
  * Click the save button

![Add the Bot ID environment variable](http://i.groupme.com/784x148.png.5790498a7acd46b289aca2be43e9c84e)

## Now go test your bot!

Go to GroupMe and type ""/cool guy"" in the group where your bot lives to see it in action.

![Test your Bot](http://i.groupme.com/821x587.png.7bcf55bed1c64acab83fa2c2ad0b0862)

# Make it your own<a name=""pull""></a>

## Pull the code to your local machine

Within terminal, change directory to the location where you would like the files to live, then run this command:

    $ heroku git:clone -a YOUR_APP_NAME_HERE

And then change directory into the new folder

    $ cd YOUR_APP_NAME_HERE

## Configure your local BOT_ID environment variable

Open the file `.env` from your local files in your text editor of choice.
Find where it says ""YOUR_BOT_ID_HERE"" and replace it with the ID of your new bot.

If you don't know what your Bot ID is, please refer back to [this](#get-bot-id) section,
where it is explained how to retrieve it.

If your Bot ID is 12345678910, then:

    BOT_ID=""YOUR_BOT_ID_HERE""

becomes:

    BOT_ID=""12345678910""

## Start the server

To test your bot locally, open terminal and run the following command to start a local server.

    $ foreman start

Then navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` in a browser.

![Local bot](http://i.groupme.com/502x133.png.f06c630467954f5dab4c742dc67b71bf)

## All done! Go play around and make the bot your own.

without messaging them individually or pinging them publically on the server.
These DMs get relayed to modmail *threads*, channels where staff members can reply to and talk with the user.
To the user, the entire process happens in DMs with the bot.

Inspired by Reddit's modmail system.

**⚠ Note on updating to v3.0.0:** If you're currently using a *very* old version of the bot, from before February 2018, you'll first need to update to v2.30.1 and run the bot once before updating to v3.0.0.

Always take a backup of your `db/data.sqlite` file before updating the bot.

# BottomSheetLayout
Simple bottom sheet view for Android

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qhutch/BottomSheetLayout/master/sample_gif.gif)


## How to use ?


### Install
Add this to your app build.gradle
```
dependencies {
    ...
    implementation 'com.qhutch.bottomsheetlayout:bottomsheetlayout:0.1.9'
}
```



### XML

And this in your layout xml :
```
<com.qhutch.bottomsheetlayout.BottomSheetLayout
        android:id=""@+id/bottom_sheet_layout""
        android:layout_width=""match_parent""
        android:layout_height=""match_parent""
        app:collapsedHeight=""80dp"">
        
        ...
        
</com.qhutch.bottomsheetlayout.BottomSheetLayout>
```
And use as any Frame Layout

*collapsedHeight* is the height of the layout when collapsed (default is 0)


### Java/(Kotlin)

#### You can use those methods on the layout :
```
BottomSheetLayout layout = (BottomSheetLayout) findViewById(R.id.bottom_sheet_layout);
...
layout.toggle(); //collapses or expands the view according to the current state
...
layout.collapse(); //collapses the view
...
layout.expand(); //expands the view
...
layout.isExpended(); //return true if the view is expanded
```


#### And if you want to track the progress :
(It may be usefull to animate views at the same time)
```
layout.setOnProgressListener(new BottomSheetLayout.OnProgressListener() {
            @Override
            public void onProgress(float progress) {
                doSomethingWithTheProgress(progress)
            }
        });
```
or in Kotlin :
```
layout.setOnProgressListener { progress -> doSomethingWithTheProgress(progress) }
```
progress is 0 when collapsed and 1 when expanded

## Changelog

321,321,Karumi/BothamUI,Swift,"# ![Karumi logo][karumilogo]BothamUI [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Karumi/BothamUI.svg?branch=ui-tests-and-travis-ci-support)](https://travis-ci.org/Karumi/BothamUI) [![CocoaPods Compatible](https://img.shields.io/cocoapods/v/BothamUI.svg)](https://img.shields.io/cocoapods/v/BothamUI.svg)

BothamUI is MVP [(Model-View-Presenter)][mvp] framework written in Swift.

This project will help you setup all your presentation logic. BothamUI provides classes to represent the main components of this pattern like ``BothamViewController`` and ``BothamPresenter``.

In addition we will use a wireframe navigation model and a service locator example[[5] [di]].

## Usage

This framework contains all the classes needed to implement your presentation logic following the MVP pattern. To use the view package, make your ``ViewController`` extend from ``Botham ViewController`` and specify in the storyboard wich class and Storyboard ID is linked to:

```swift
import BothamUI

class SampleViewController: BothamViewController {
    /*...*/
}
```
![storyboardReference]

#### Storyboard

`BothamStoryboard` provide a series of methods to help you instantiate view controllers by there storyboard ID. By default `instantiateViewController()` will search for view controller with the storyboard ID with the same name as the class.

```swift
import BothamUI

let mainStoryboard = BothamStoryboard(name: ""Main"")
let viewController: SampleViewController = mainStoryboard.instantiateViewController(""SampleViewController"")
let viewController: SampleViewController = mainStoryboard.instantiateViewController()
```

#### Presenter
To follow the MVP pattern, BothamUI also provides a ``BothamPresenter`` protocol that will be responsible for all your presentation logic. BothamUI will take care of linking your view (a ``BothamViewController``) with your presenter and subscribing it to its lifecycle. In order to do that, create a class that implement ``BothamPresenter`` and link it to your view:

```swift
import BothamUI

class SamplePresenter: BothamPresenter {
    private weak var ui: SampleUI?

    init(ui: CharacterDetailUI) {
        self.ui = ui
    }
    
    func viewDidLoad() {
        /* ... */
    }
}
```

```swift
protocol SampleUI: BothamUI {
	/* ... */
}
```
```swift
class SampleViewController: BothamViewController, SampleUI {
    /*...*/
}
```
### Dependency injection

BothamUI is built around the concept of dependency injection, all the dependencies are provided by constructor or properties, base on what UIKit allows us.

#### ViewController Instantiation

In the example a Service Locator is used in order to instantiate view controllers, but you can also use [Swinject](https://github.com/Swinject/Swinject) or others DI frameworks.

```swift
class ServiceLocator {

    static let sharedInstance = ServiceLocator()

    func provideSampleViewController() -> SampleViewController {
        let viewController: SampleViewController = provideMainStoryboard().viewController()
        viewController.presenter = SamplePresenter(ui: viewController)
        return viewController
    }
}
```

#### Lifecycle

Once both, view and presenter, are linked you can react to your view lifecycle directly from the presenter. You will be also able to call your view easily from the presenter:

```swift
class SamplePresenter: BothamPresenter {
    private weak var ui: SampleUI?

    init(ui: CharacterDetailUI) {
        self.ui = ui
    }
    
    func viewDidLoad() {
        self.ui?.showMessage(""Welcome to Botham"")
    }
}
```

To understand when the lifecycle methods are called take a look at the following table:

| BothamPresenter       | UIViewController      |
| --------------------- |-----------------------|
| ``viewDidLoad``       | ``viewDidLoad``       |
| ``viewWillAppear``    | ``viewWillAppear``    |
| ``viewDidAppear``     | ``viewDidAppear ``    |
| ``viewWillDisappear`` | ``viewWillDisappear`` |
| ``viewDidDisappear``  | ``viewDidDisappear``  |


### Caveats

* ViewControllers instantiated view UIStoryboard, can't reference Generic Type.
* Presenter and ViewController have a circular reference (like a ViewController and Datasource).



## CocoaPods

[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for Cocoa projects. You can install it with the following command:

```bash
$ gem install cocoapods
```

> CocoaPods 0.39.0+ is required to build BothamUI.

To integrate BothamUI into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your `Podfile`:

```ruby
source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'
platform :ios, '8.0'
use_frameworks!

pod 'BothamUI', '~> 1.0'
```

Then, run the following command:

```bash
$ pod install
```

Yet another Discord bot that tries to do everything - [atlasbot.xyz](https://atlasbot.xyz)

This is all the code that runs the bot portion of Atlas. The dashboard, API and other secret sauce will remain closed source for now. Contributions are welcome.

## Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docker.com/)
- [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) >=10.0.0 \*

\* Required for development. If you're self-hosting, you can skip these requirements.

## Installation

Linux is recommended, but Docker means macOS, Windows and more or less anything that runs Docker will work. For development, anything that runs Node.js and Docker will work.

#### Self-hosting

1. Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

1. Clone this repo

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/atlasbot/bot.git
   ```

1. Open a terminal in the cloned folder

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in the required env variables. See below for what most do. Google is your friend.

1. Start the bot with `docker-compose up -d`. If you did everything right, then congratulations - you now have your own instance of Atlas.

#### Development

1. Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/), [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

1. Clone this repo

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/atlasbot/bot.git
   ```

1. Open a terminal in the cloned folder

1. Run `npm install` to install dependencies

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and replace any variables you would like. Setting `NODE_ENV` to `development` will enable extra features and help debugging things.

1. Start Lavalink, Redis and Mongo via `docker-compose up -d mongo lavalink redis`

   If you are using docker-compose to host these services, you can leave the defaults in `.env.example` for those services and it should be gucci.

1. Start the bot with `npm run dev`

1. Start breaking things. Once you save a file change, the bot will restart with the changes. Do `npm run start` to start the bot without watching files.

## Development ""Features""

The `NODE_ENV` environment variable must be set to `development` for these to work.

- To run a filter without it being enabled, include `Atlas:forceFilter:filter` with whatever you want to test. E.g, `Atlas:forceFilter:invites discord.gg/AXXBPM7` will the ""invites"" filter to execute even when it's action type is `0`.

## Disclaimer / Warning

If you're going to self-host Atlas, you won't get help with setting it up. We may refuse to support you with general issues. You are responsible if you break anything. Seriously, if you don't know what you're doing, just use the public instance.

[Wiki under construction](https://github.com/miguelhincapie/CustomBottomSheetBehavior/wiki) but still with some info already, until I complete it you can take a look at the example (app module).<br><br>

### Check the following files
* [activity_main.xml](https://github.com/miguelhincapie/CustomBottomSheetBehavior/blob/master/app/src/main/res/layout/activity_main.xml) (is like a template)
* [activity_main.java](https://github.com/miguelhincapie/CustomBottomSheetBehavior/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/mahc/custombottomsheet/MainActivity.java) (you can see how to listen for states)
* [styles.xml](https://github.com/miguelhincapie/CustomBottomSheetBehavior/blob/master/app/src/main/res/values/styles.xml) (just the line <style name=""AppTheme.NoActionBar"">)
* [AndroidManifest.xml](https://github.com/miguelhincapie/CustomBottomSheetBehavior/blob/master/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml) (just the line android:theme=""@style/AppTheme.NoActionBar"")

## What I did?
1. I took the code from BottomSheetBehavior.java from Support Library 23.4.0 and added one state for anchor mode, so now you have:<br>
STATE_HIDDEN<br>
STATE_COLLAPSED<br>
STATE_DRAGGING<br>
STATE_ANCHOR_POINT<br>
STATE_EXPANDED.<br><br>

2. Created Behaviors for FAB, ToolBars and ImageView.


## Motivation
Spend more than 3 days looking snipet of code or stackoverflow answers about it with no luck.

## Current state
Trying to help/close issues.

# BottomNavyBar

A beautiful and animated bottom navigation.
The navigation bar uses your current theme, but you are free to customize it.

| Preview | PageView |
|---------|----------|
|![FanBottomNavyBar Gif](https://github.com/pedromassango/bottom_navy_bar/blob/master/images/navy.gif) | ![Fix Gif](https://github.com/pedromassango/bottom_navy_bar/blob/master/images/fix.gif) |

## Customization (Optional)

### BottomNavyBar
- `iconSize` - the item icon's size
- `items` - navigation items, required more than one item and less than six
- `selectedIndex` - the current item index. Use this to change the selected item. Defaults to zero
- `onItemSelected` - required to listen when an item is tapped it provides the selected item's index
- `backgroundColor` - the navigation bar's background color
- `showElevation` - if false the appBar's elevation will be removed
- `mainAxisAlignment` - use this property to change the horizontal alignment of the items. It is mostly used when you have ony two items and you want to center the items
- `curve` - param to customize the item change's animation
- `containerHeight` - changes the Navigation Bar's height
 
### BottomNavyBarItem
- `icon` - the icon of this item
- `title` - the text that will appear next to the icon when this item is selected
- `activeColor` - the active item's background and text color
- `inactiveColor` - the inactive item's icon color
- `textAlign` - property to change the alignment of the item title

## Getting Started

Add the dependency in `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  ...
  bottom_navy_bar: ^5.6.0
```

## Basic Usage

Adding the widget

```dart
bottomNavigationBar: BottomNavyBar(
   selectedIndex: _selectedIndex,
   showElevation: true, // use this to remove appBar's elevation
   onItemSelected: (index) => setState(() {
              _selectedIndex = index;
              _pageController.animateToPage(index,
                  duration: Duration(milliseconds: 300), curve: Curves.ease);
    }),
   items: [
     BottomNavyBarItem(
       icon: Icon(Icons.apps),
       title: Text('Home'),
       activeColor: Colors.red,
     ),
     BottomNavyBarItem(
         icon: Icon(Icons.people),
         title: Text('Users'),
         activeColor: Colors.purpleAccent
     ),
     BottomNavyBarItem(
         icon: Icon(Icons.message),
         title: Text('Messages'),
         activeColor: Colors.pink
     ),
     BottomNavyBarItem(
         icon: Icon(Icons.settings),
         title: Text('Settings'),
         activeColor: Colors.blue
     ),
   ],
)
```

## Use with PageView and PageController

```dart
class _MyHomePageState extends State<MyHomePage> {

  int _currentIndex = 0;
  PageController _pageController;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _pageController = PageController();
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    _pageController.dispose();
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text(""Bottom Nav Bar"")),
      body: SizedBox.expand(
        child: PageView(
          controller: _pageController,
          onPageChanged: (index) {
            setState(() => _currentIndex = index);
          },
          children: <Widget>[
            Container(color: Colors.blueGrey,),
            Container(color: Colors.red,),
            Container(color: Colors.green,),
            Container(color: Colors.blue,),
          ],
        ),
      ),
      bottomNavigationBar: BottomNavyBar(
        selectedIndex: _currentIndex,
        onItemSelected: (index) {
          setState(() => _currentIndex = index);
          _pageController.jumpToPage(index);
        },
        items: <BottomNavyBarItem>[
          BottomNavyBarItem(
            title: Text('Item One'),
            icon: Icon(Icons.home)
          ),
          BottomNavyBarItem(
            title: Text('Item Two'),
            icon: Icon(Icons.apps)
          ),
          BottomNavyBarItem(
            title: Text('Item Three'),
            icon: Icon(Icons.chat_bubble)
          ),
          BottomNavyBarItem(
            title: Text('Item Four'),
            icon: Icon(Icons.settings)
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

326,326,edwardhdlu/q-trader,Python,"# Q-Trader

An implementation of Q-learning applied to (short-term) stock trading. The model uses n-day windows of closing prices to determine if the best action to take at a given time is to buy, sell or sit.

As a result of the short-term state representation, the model is not very good at making decisions over long-term trends, but is quite good at predicting peaks and troughs.

## Results

Some examples of results on test sets:

![^GSPC 2015](https://github.com/edwardhdlu/q-trader/blob/master/images/^GSPC_2015.png)
S&P 500, 2015. Profit of $431.04.

![BABA_2015](https://github.com/edwardhdlu/q-trader/blob/master/images/BABA_2015.png)
Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, 2015. Loss of $351.59.

![AAPL 2016](https://github.com/edwardhdlu/q-trader/blob/master/images/AAPL_2016.png)
Apple, Inc, 2016. Profit of $162.73.

![GOOG_8_2017](https://github.com/edwardhdlu/q-trader/blob/master/images/GOOG_8_2017.png)
Google, Inc, August 2017. Profit of $19.37.

## Running the Code

To train the model, download a training and test csv files from [Yahoo! Finance](https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EGSPC/history?p=%5EGSPC) into `data/`
```
mkdir model
python train ^GSPC 10 1000
```

Then when training finishes (minimum 200 episodes for results):
```
python evaluate.py ^GSPC_2011 model_ep1000
```

## Feature

- Automatically Renew E5 Subscription(Customizable Frequency)
- Manageable Simple Account System
- Available Task Execution Feedback
- Convenient Authorization
- Use concurrency to speed up

## Principle

E5 subscription is a subscription for developers, as long as the related API is called, it may be renewed

Calling [Outlook ReadMail API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/user-list-messages?view=graph-rest-1.0&tabs=http)
to renew, does not guarantee the renewal effect.

## Usage

1. Type `/bind` in the robot dialog
2. Click the link sent by the robot and register the Microsoft application, log in with the E5 master account or the
   same domain account, and obtain `client_secret`. **Click to go back to Quick Start**, get `client_id`
3. Copy `client_secret` and `client_id` and reply to bot in the format of `client_id(space)client_secret`
   (Pay attention to spaces)
4. Click on the authorization link sent by the robot and log in with the `E5` master account or the same domain account
5. After authorization, it will jump to `http://localhost/e5sub……` (will prompt webpage error, just copy the link)
6. Copy the link, and reply `link(space)alias (used to manage accounts)` in the robot dialog For
   example: `http://localhost/e5sub/?code=abcd MyE5`, wait for the robot to bind and then complete

"
328,328,CiscoDevNet/botkit-template,JavaScript,"# Botkit template

This project implements a Botkit + Webex Teams adapter bot, based on the [generator-botkit](https://www.npmjs.com/package/generator-botkit) Yoeman template, providing a few extra good-practice features, plus several interesting samples:

- Optionally use Webex Teams Node.js SDK websockets for incoming events and messages, instead of webhooks

- A 'health check' URL: check bot availability, uptime and metadata by browsing to the bot's public URL

- Quality-of-life features: fallback/catch-all module; welcome message when user joins a space

- 'Help' command auto-generation function

- Redis/MongoDB storage support for persistent/scalable storage of conversation state

- checkAddMention() function to automatically format bot commands for 1:1 or group space usage

## Websockets vs. Webhooks

Most Botkit features can be implemented by using the Webex Teams JS SDK websockets functionality, which establishes a persistent connection to the Webex Teams cloud for outbound and inbound messages/events.

Webex Teams also supports traditional HTTP webhooks for messages/events, which requires that your bot be accessible via a publically reachable URL.  A public URL is also needed if your bot will be serving any web pages/files, e.g. images associated with the cards and buttons feature or the health check URL.

- If you don't need to serve buttons and cards images, you can set the environment variable `WEBSOCKET_EVENTS=True` and avoid the need for a public URL
- If you are implementing buttons & cards, you will need a public URL (e. g. by using a service like Ngrok, or hosting your bot in the cloud) - configure this via the `PUBLIC_URL` environment variable 

## How to run (local machine)

Assuming you plan to us [ngrok](https://ngrok.com) to give your bot a publically available URL (optional, see above), you can run this template in a jiffy:

1. Clone this repo:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/botkit-template.git

    cd botkit-template
    ```

1. Install the Node.js dependencies:

    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

1. Create a Webex Teams bot account at ['Webex for Developers'](https://developer.webex.com/my-apps/new/bot), and note/save your bot's access token

1. Launch Ngrok to expose port 3000 of your local machine to the internet:

    ```sh
    ngrok http 3000
    ```

    Note/save the 'Forwarding' HTTPS (not HTTP) address that ngrok generates

1. Rename the `env.example` file to `.env`, then edit to configure the settings and info for your bot.

    >Note: you can also specify any of these settings via environment variables (which will take precedent over any settings configured in the `.env` file) - often preferred in production environments.

    To successfully run all of the sample features, you'll need to specify at minimum a `PUBLIC_URL` (ngrok HTTPS forwarding URL), and a `WEBEX_ACCESS_TOKEN` (Webex Teams bot access token).

    >If running on Glitch.me or Heroku (with [Dyno Metadata](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/dyno-metadata) enbaled), the `PUBLIC_URL` will be auto-configured.

    Additional values in the `.env` file (like `OWNER` and `CODE`) are used to populate the healthcheck URL meta-data.

    Be sure to save the `.env` file!

1. You're ready to run your bot:

    ```sh
    node bot.js
    ```

## Quick start on Glitch.me

* Click [![Remix on Glitch](https://cdn.glitch.com/2703baf2-b643-4da7-ab91-7ee2a2d00b5b%2Fremix-button.svg)](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/import/github/CiscoDevNet/botkit-template)

* Delete the `.env` file that Glitch created automatically

* Rename `.env.example` to `.env`, then open it for editing.

    Find the `WEBEX_ACCESS_TOKEN` variable, paste in your bot's access token

    **Optional**: enter appropriate info in the ""Bot meta info..."" section

    >Note that, thanks to the Glitch `PROJECT_DOMAIN` env variable, you do not need to add a `PUBLIC_URL` variable pointing to your app domain

You bot is all set, responding in 1-1 and 'group' spaces, and sending a welcome message when added to a space!

You can verify the bot is up and running by browsing to its healthcheck URL (i.e. the app domain.)

## Quick start on Heroku

* Create a new project pointing to this repo.

* Open your app's **Settings** tab, and reveal your **Config Vars**

* Add a `WEBEX_ACCESS_TOKEN` variable with your bot's access token as value

* Add a `PUBLIC_URL` variable pointing to your app's Heroku URL

    >If your app is using [Dyno Metadata](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/dyno-metadata), the public URL will be detected automatically

    ![](assets/images/heroku_config-variables.png)

* In the upper right under the **More** dropdown, select **Restart all dynos**    

You bot is all set!  You can invite it to 1-1 and 'group' spaces, see it sending a welcome message when added, and responding to commands (try `help`.)

You can always verify the bot is operational by browsing to its healthcheck URL (i.e. the app domain.)"

# Using the Official Mantaro Bot

**Just one [click](https://add.mantaro.site) and you can add Mantaro to your own server and enjoy its full feature set!**

You can see more information about the bot itself by reading the summary on [here](https://github.com/Mantaro/MantaroBot/blob/master/FEATURES.md). This is the file we use to publish our bots on bot lists, too. You're welcome to use it as a guide for your own. Our [webpage](https://mantaro.site) is hosted in [Github Pages](https://github.com/Mantaro/mantaro.github.io) and outlines most features of the bot, alongside some useful links.

# Building your own Mantaro

## ⚠ **Read before attempting**
The owners of Mantaro do not recommend compiling Mantaro as it is not documented, and most builds here will be extremely unstable and (probably) untested, probably including unfinished features. There's no *stable* branch, all the features are immediately added to upstream.\
You will however sometimes see a legacy branch, a branch we create before publishing larger update containing working code, it is highly recommended basing your building process from the legacy branch, as the master branch will very likely contain broken and non-working code, at least in a case where a legacy branch exist.

**We will not provide any support whatsoever in selfhosting or building the bot by yourself.**
The reason for this is not only that the builds in here can be highly unstable, but also that there are very few people (two) who could actually help with questions regarding this, most of which are busy and not available to answer said questions. Most of the build process is pretty straightforward and outlined below, though.

## Building the Bot

### Prerequisite:

You will need the following to utilize all of Mantaro's features when building your own instance (items marked with a star are optional):
* RethinkDB, at least version 2.4
* Java Development Kit, version 15 (not lower!)
* Redis, at least version 6
* Wolke's Weeb API (For most of the action commands)*

**We will not provide any support whatsoever in obtaining any of the above.**

<sub>Note: The bot does not necessarily need the Weeb API key to function, but some functionality might be limited by the lack of them (no action commands). Due to the closed nature of that API, we encourage you to submit a patch that would allow custom images to be used on self-hosted instances if you'd like (ex. by pushing your own -local- API server), but keep them in line with the rest of the code.</sub> 

### Editing Code:
Mantaro isn't a modular bot (sadly), but removing features is fairly easy. You can just remove the respective command or the Module file on the commands directory and everything *should* still work. The exception are some Modules that are required by other Modules.
Make sure you pay close attention to the [license](https://github.com/Mantaro/MantaroBot/blob/master/LICENSE) as you will be required to disclose your source as well as state any changes made.

### Steps for building:
<sub>Please do note that you will not receive any help whatsoever while trying to make your own Mantaro build (see above).</sub>

1.  Make sure you have the prerequisites installed and running.
2.  Clone this repository (you can also fork this repo and clone your fork). 
3.  Open a terminal (cmd.exe or any linux terminal) in the folder where you cloned this on.
4.  Run `gradlew shadowJar`
5.  Grab the jar from `build/libs`
6.  Install `rethinkdb` and `redis`
7.  On rethinkdb, create the `mantaro` database with the following tables: `mantaro, players, marriages, playerstats, users, guilds, keys, commands, seasonalplayers`
8.  Run it, wait a little for the bot to generate a file called `config.json`
9.  Prepare yourself to start filling in some config values. You don't need to fill all values, though. The token and the user id are necessary to start up, you wanna set the owner IDs aswell to be able to use owner commands. Values you *need* to fill: `token clientId`, values you *need* to change: `""bucketFactor"" : 1 ""isSelfHost"" : true`.
9.  In config.json, you might want set the value needApi to false, or clone and run [the API](https://github.com/Kodehawa/mantaro-api))

### Extra runtime options:
This are java arguments that Mantaro parses outside of config.json at startup and that can be dynamically adjusted using a script, a systemd service or similar:
*   `-Dmantaro.node-number=x` - Specify the number of this node (important if you use more than once instance)
*   `-Dmantaro.shard-count=x` - Specify the amount of shards Mantaro will be starting up. (for all nodes, see below for subsets)
*   `-Dmantaro.from-shard=x` - Start Shard Manager from shard X. (inclusive)
*   `-Dmantaro.to-shard=y`- Start Shard Manager up to shard Y. (exclusive)
*   `-Dmantaro.verbose` - Log all the things.
*   `-Dmantaro.verbose_shard_logs` - Show all shard status changes.
*   `-Dmantaro.debug` - Start Mantaro with two shards and some extra logging, regardless of the settings above.
*   `-Dmantaro.debug_logs` - Use debug logs.
*   `-Dmantaro.trace_logs` - Spam your logs.
*   `-Dmantaro.log_db_access` - Log all db access. (spams your logs aswell)
*   `-Dmantaro.disable-non-allocating-buffer` - Disable LP's non-allocating buffer.

The above options can also be used as environment variables by removing `-D`, and replacing `.` with `_`, for example, `-Dmantaro.node-number=x` becomes environment variable `MANTARO_NODE_NUMBER=x`

![alt text](https://github.com/aviddot/Pancakeswap-and-uniswap-trading-bot/blob/main/v2gif.gif?raw=true ""GIF application"")

<H2>Prerequisites</H2>

- An ethereum/bsc address
- A Windows machine (adding support for Mac OS and Linux soon) 
- When trading on Uniswap: infura.io
- <i>Not sure whether needed anymore: Visual C++ build tools (www.visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/)</i>

<br> </br>
<H2>Getting started</H2>

0. Read prerequisites

1. Download the latest release or download ""configfile.py"" and ""tradingbot.exe"" from the repository.


2. Open ""configfile.py"" (with notepad for instance) and add your ethereum address and personal key at the bottom of the file between the quotation marks('').

<pre>...
my_address = ''
my_pk = ''</pre>


3. Run ""tradingbot.exe""

- Make sure configfile.py and bot.exe are in the same folder.


5. Edit settings according to choice.


<br> </br>
<H2>Functions</H2>


<b>Main coin/token</b>: The token or coin you want to trade tokens for and with

<b>Token address</b>: Fill the token address of the token you want to trade (such as 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000)

<b>Notes</b>: A place to fill in notes, such as the name of the token

<b>Sell($)</b>: The price you want the trader to sell the token for (0.01 = 1 dollar cent)

<b>Buy($)</b>: The price you want the trader to buy the token for (0.01 = 1 dollar cent)

<b>Trade w/ main</b>: Toggle if you want to activate trading with your main-coin/token

<b>Trade w/ token (Experimental!)</b>: Toggle if you want to trade the token with other BEP20 tokens of which this option is activated (see tokentokennumerator)

<b>Stoploss</b>: Toggle to activate stoploss (0.01 = 1 dollar cent)


<b>Second(s) between checking price</b>: Standard is 4 seconds. With a infura server with max 100.000tx/day 4 seconds is good for 2 activated token 24hr/day


<b>Seconds waiting between trades</b>: depends on how fast transactions finalize

<b>Max slippage</b>: The maximum slippage you want to allow while trading (3 = 3%)

<b>$ to keep in ETH/BNB after trade</b>: The amount of ETH/BNB you want to keep after each trade (excluding transaction fees) in terms of $.

<b>GWEI</b>: The amount of gas you want to use for each trade (5 GWEI is fine for PCS). When trading on uniswap, This becomes the max GWEI you want to pay on the eth network, the GWEI will be determined from ethgasstation.com

<b>Different deposit address</b>: Use this if you want the swap output to go to a different address (without extra fees).

<b>Tokentokennumerator (Experimental!)</b>: This value lets you trade ERC tokens with each other. The code to create the value is as followed:

<pre>if pricetoken1usd > ((token1high + token1low) / 2) and pricetoken2usd < ((token2high + token2low) / 2):
  token1totoken2 = ((pricetoken1usd - token1low) / (token1high - token1low)) / ((pricetoken2usd - token2low) / (token2high - token2low))</pre>
  
  If you dont want to wait till the token1 is sold for the maincoinoption, because you are uncertain whether token2 will still be at this price level or think that token1 will     drop, you can use this function. To use this function, ""Trade with ERC"" should be activated for at least 2 tokens, and the highs and lows should be set seriously.
    
  As an example, if the current price of token1 is $0.9 and its set ""high""=$1 and ""low""=$0, the value of this token is seen as ""90%"". Token2 also has a high of $1, but the         current price is 0.2$, value of this token is seen as 20%. The tokentokenmnumerator is set at 3.3. If we divide the 90% by the 20%, we get 4.5, which is higher than 3.3, which   means that token1 gets traded for token2 instantly. If the tokentokennumerator was set to 5, the swap would not happen.

**NOTICE**

LiveBot is specifically designed for bots; it cannot be used for user accounts. The LiveBot developers take no resposibility for the actions executed through LiveBot.

---

An app that allows you to be inside a bot!

At the moment, LiveBot is still in alpha. Installation instructions can be found below.

## Support Server
If you would like to get the latest information on the project, talk with the developers, post suggestions, get help, etc., join the official LiveBot [Discord server!](https://discord.gg/NG4rgqSgzx)

## Preview
<img src='https://i.imgur.com/m0HvVmn.png' alt='LiveBot image preview' height='300px' style='border-radius: 10px;'/>

LiveBot is a program built with Electron and Discord.js that will allow you to control your bot from a client resembling the official one for users. You are able to view messages in channels, send messages, interact with people and see what is going on in the servers your bot is in.

LiveBot has been built so that the style and flow is similar to discord, and while it is not exact, it is pretty close. It is also built from scratch using no frameworks, just straight HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Due to this, and having a very small development team, additional features may take a while to be added. The point is to built from scratch, we know very well that it's not the fastest way to make something like this. However, LiveBot is slowly being filled with cool exclusive features like the pull-up user settings menu, the soon to come embed builder, native support for scripts, and more!

## Installation
### Release (recommended)

To download a binary executable file, simply click on the latest [Release](../../releases) on the right side of the page, and download whichever zip or tar.gz file suits your needs. For example, if you use Windows, you should download the zip file that says ""win32"", if you use Linux, you will download the file that says ""linux"", and if you use macOS you will download the file that says ""darwin"". Once you download and decompress the file, just execute it as you would any other application. 


### From Source (unstable)

LiveBot requires the [Node.js] JavaScript runtime to run.

You can download the source with [Git] (and get updates easily) or you can download as a zipped (compressed) file from GitHub. If you wish to download as a zip file, GitHub provides a big green ""Code"" button which you can press to download the file.

If you want to download with Git, a bash command to do so is found below:

```sh
# with SSH (requires public key to be set)
git clone ""git@github.com:SebOuellette/LiveBot.git""

# with HTTP
git clone ""https://github.com/SebOuellette/LiveBot.git""
```

After cloning with Git or decompressing the zip file, you must open the directory the source is located in and install the dependencies with npm (or your preferred package manager) with the following command:

```sh
npm install
```

When your package manager is finished installing, you may start the program with `npm start`.

## Features
### Token switcher (User menu)
This box is how you log into a profile after already logging in. To log into a token by default, put it into this box then press the save button. Otherwise if you are just logging into a token just for a look, input the token into the box then press `enter`.

The token changer used to be at the top of the main screen, but has moved to the user options menu.

<img src='https://i.imgur.com/1rnEpQD.png' alt='Token switcher preview' style='border-radius: 10px;'>

### Barry
Barry is the LiveBot version of discord's Clyde. Except Barry has some fun commands! Just use the prefix `/` and to see the commands write `/help`. Only you can see what barry says, so don't worry about interfering with any conversations. <br>
<img src='https://i.imgur.com/PGInuit.png' alt=""Barry's help message"" style='border-radius: 10px;'>

### Profile card
The profile card is able to tell you the username, the avatar image, the discriminator, and something discord does not have. The profile card will tell you if the account you are signed into is a bot or a user. This can be handy if you are not quite sure. As you can no longer login with a user account it's just legacy code and for the looks. This card also has the pull up menu on the right side, so you can get to all the settings. <br>

<img src='https://i.imgur.com/79NacEx.png' alt='Profile card preview' style='border-radius: 10px;'>

### Generate Invite

LiveBot gives you the ability to generate an invite quickly from within the app, instead of having to go to your bot's application page in the Discord Developer portal. It can be found in the user settings page in the pull up menu. Just toggle all the permissions you'd like to give the invite (by default, everything recommended to use LiveBot's features is enabled).

# Golang Crypto Trading Bot

A golang implementation of a console-based trading bot for cryptocurrency exchanges.

## Usage

Download a release or directly build the code from this repository.

``` bash
go get github.com/saniales/golang-crypto-trading-bot
```

If you need to, you can create a strategy and bind it to the bot:

``` go
import bot ""github.com/saniales/golang-crypto-trading-bot/cmd""

func main() {
    bot.AddCustomStrategy(examples.MyStrategy)
    bot.Execute()
}
```

For strategy reference see the [Godoc documentation](https://godoc.org/github.com/saniales/golang-crypto-trading-bot).

## Introduction
The LINE Messaging API SDK for Go makes it easy to develop bots using LINE Messaging API, and you can create a sample bot within minutes.

## Documentation

See the official API documentation for more information.

- English: https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/messaging-api/overview/
- Japanese: https://developers.line.biz/ja/docs/messaging-api/overview/

## Requirements

This library requires Go 1.11 or later.

## Installation ##

```sh
$ go get -u github.com/line/line-bot-sdk-go/v7/linebot
```

## Configuration ##

```go
import (
	""github.com/line/line-bot-sdk-go/v7/linebot""
)

func main() {
	bot, err := linebot.New(""<channel secret>"", ""<channel access token>"")
	...
}

```

### Configuration with http.Client ###

```go
client := &http.Client{}
bot, err := linebot.New(""<channel secret>"", ""<channel accsss token>"", linebot.WithHTTPClient(client))
...
```

## How to start ##

The LINE Messaging API uses the JSON data format.
```ParseRequest()``` will help you to parse the ```*http.Request``` content and return a slice of Pointer point to Event Object.

```go
events, err := bot.ParseRequest(req)
if err != nil {
	// Do something when something bad happened.
}
```

The LINE Messaging API defines 7 types of event - ```EventTypeMessage```, ```EventTypeFollow```, ```EventTypeUnfollow```, ```EventTypeJoin```, ```EventTypeLeave```, ```EventTypePostback```, ```EventTypeBeacon```. You can check the event type by using ```event.Type```

```go
for _, event := range events {
	if event.Type == linebot.EventTypeMessage {
		// Do Something...
	}
}
```

### Receiver ###

To send a message to a user, group, or room, you need either an ID

```go
userID := event.Source.UserID
groupID := event.Source.GroupID
RoomID := event.Source.RoomID
```

or a reply token.

```go
replyToken := event.ReplyToken
```

### Create message ###

The LINE Messaging API provides various types of message. To create a message, use ```New<Type>Message()```.

```go
leftBtn := linebot.NewMessageAction(""left"", ""left clicked"")
rightBtn := linebot.NewMessageAction(""right"", ""right clicked"")

template := linebot.NewConfirmTemplate(""Hello World"", leftBtn, rightBtn)

message := linebot.NewTemplateMessage(""Sorry :(, please update your app."", template)
```

### Send message ###

With an ID, you can send message using ```PushMessage()```

```go
var messages []linebot.SendingMessage

// append some message to messages

_, err := bot.PushMessage(ID, messages...).Do()
if err != nil {
	// Do something when some bad happened
}
```

With a reply token, you can reply to messages using ```ReplyMessage()```

```go
var messages []linebot.SendingMessage

// append some message to messages

_, err := bot.ReplyMessage(replyToken, messages...).Do()
if err != nil {
	// Do something when some bad happened
}
```

338,338,php-telegram-bot/example-bot,PHP,"# PHP Telegram Bot Example

> :construction: Work In Progress :construction:

An A-Z example of Telegram bot using the [PHP Telegram Bot][core-github] library.

This repository aims to demonstrate the usage of all the features offered by the PHP Telegram Bot library and as such contains all example commands.
Also, it gives an example setup for both the standard usage and using the [PHP Telegram Bot Manager][bot-manager-github] 

**:exclamation: Important!**
- Most of the commands found here are **not to be used exactly as they are**, they are mere demonstrations of features! They are provided as-is and any **extra security measures need to be added by you**, the developer.
- Before getting started with this project, make sure you have read the official [readme][core-readme-github] to understand how the PHP Telegram Bot library works and what is required to run a Telegram bot.

Let's get started then! :smiley:

## 0. Cloning this repository

To start off, you can clone this repository using git:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/php-telegram-bot/example-bot.git
```

or better yet, download it as a zip file:

```bash
$ curl -o example-bot.zip https://github.com/php-telegram-bot/example-bot/archive/master.zip
```

Unzip the files to the root of your project folder.

## 1. Making it yours

Now you can choose what installation you would like, either the default one or using the [Bot Manager][bot-manager-github] project.
Depending on which one you choose, you can delete the files that are not required.

---

First of all, you need to rename `config.example.php` to `config.php` and then replace all necessary values with those of your project.

**Default**
Some of these files require extra configurations to be added. Check `hook.php` how they are loaded.
Thanks to reading the main readme file, you should know what these files do.

- `composer.json` (Describes your project and it's dependencies)
- `set.php` (Used to set the webhook)
- `unset.php` (Used to unset the webhook)
- `hook.php` (Used for the webhook method)
- `getUpdatesCLI.php` (Used for the getUpdates method)
- `cron.php` (Used to execute commands via cron)

**Bot Manager**
Using the bot manager makes life much easier, as all configuration goes into a single file, `manager.php`.

If you decide to use the Bot Manager, be sure to [read all about it][bot-manager-readme-github] and change the `require` block in the `composer.json` file:
```json
""require"": {
    ""php-telegram-bot/telegram-bot-manager"": ""*""
}
```

Then, edit the following files, replacing all necessary values with those of your project.

- `composer.json` (Describes your project and it's dependencies)
- `manager.php` (Used as the main entry point for everything)

---

Now you can install all dependencies using [composer]:
```bash
$ composer install
```

## 2. Adding your own commands

To use Commands enable the [`CustomCommands`](CustomCommands) folder in the config.

You can find a few example commands in the [`Commands`](Commands) folder.
Do **NOT** just copy all of them to your bot, but instead learn from them and only add to your bot what you need.


Adding any extra commands to your bot that you don't need can be a security risk!

Jesse is an advanced crypto trading framework which aims to simplify researching and defining trading strategies.

## Why Jesse?
In short, Jesse is more accurate than other solutions, and way more simple. 
In fact, it is so simple that in case you already know Python, you can get started today, in matter of minutes, instead of weeks and months. 

[Here](https://docs.jesse.trade/docs/) you can read more about why Jesse's features.

## What's next?
This is the very initial release. There's way more. Subscribe to our mailing list at [jesse.trade](https://jesse.trade) to get the good stuff as soon they're released. Don't worry, We won't send you spam. Pinky promise.

## Community
I created a [discord server](https://jesse.trade/discord) for Jesse users to discuss algo-trading. It's a warm place to share ideas, and help each other out.

## How to contribute
Thank you for your interest in contributing to the project. Before starting to work on a PR, please make sure that it isn't under the ""in progress"" column in our [Github project page](https://github.com/jesse-ai/jesse/projects/2). In case you want to help but don't know what tasks we need help for, checkout the ""todo"" column. 

First, you need to install Jesse from the repository instead of PyPi:

```sh
# first, make sure that the PyPi version is not installed
pip uninstall jesse

# now install Jesse from the repository
git clone https://github.com/jesse-ai/jesse.git
cd jesse
pip install -e .
```

Now every change you make to the code will be affected immediately.

After every change, make sure your changes did not break any functionality by running tests:
```
pytest
```

Welcome to the TL-BOTS repo. This collection contains source files, tools, and
other components of a vast array of botnet families. The families covered here
range from 2014/2015 to the present day.

Files in this collection have been gathered via distributed trawling of the 
internet, and deduplicated where applicable.

## Disclaimer ##

The files contained in this repo are for research purposes only. They are 
provided as-is and have no guarantee of functionality.

## What is a botnet? ##

A botnet is a network of infected devices that contact a Command and Control 
Server (C2) to receive instructions for attacks. Botnets are used for many 
different purposes, including DDoS, fraud, and loading/spreading other malware.

## Mitigations ##

Mitigations vary from system to system, but the core security principles apply 
to each of them. Regular patching, network segmentation, and proper device 
configuration are crucial to maintaining the security of devices.

## Navigating the Repo ##

The repo is divided into several folders, containing specific categories of 
activity.

Zip files may have the same or similar names, so each filename contains an 
identifier based on the first 6 characters of the SHA1 hash of the file. 
The formula is:

    FILENAME.SHA1.EXTENSION

Non Zip files may contain this naming pattern as well.

## Collection Highlights ## 

Nearly every version of Mirai and QBot since the beginning of both of these 
malware families is contained in this repo. For more information about the 
origin of these malware families, check out HISTORY.md

## Researching This Collection ## 

This collection contains a vast number of botnets that have come and gone, 
and others that are still around in some form. While the bots themselves 
are steadily evolving, the core of many of them rely on exploiting whatever 
low hanging fruit is available at the time. A more detailed analysis of this 
collection, and resources to research further, is located in RESEARCH.md

## Contributing ## 

Contributions to this repo are welcome. Simply fork this repo, open a pull 
request and consult with the repo maintainers about it. 

### Guidelines ###

- Please submit larger files (> 5 MB) as a zip file in order to make cloning this a reasonable exercise.
- Please try and follow our naming convention for zip files in order to deduplicate and identify hashes. 

Files are subject to rejection if they do not meet our guidelines.

### We will NOT accept the following ###

- Combolists
- Database dumps
- Any credentials for active sites or devices, user, admin or otherwise

## Special Thanks ##

Special thanks goes to GreyNoise.io, who has catalogued nearly every exploit used 
in this collection. More information on using their tools to further research these 
botnets is located in RESEARCH.md

# aria-telegram-mirror-bot

This is a Telegram bot that uses [aria2](https://github.com/aria2/aria2) to download files over BitTorrent / HTTP(S) and uploads them to your Google Drive. This can be useful for downloading from slow servers. Parallel downloading and download queuing are supported. There are some features to try to reduce piracy.

## Support
Post your ideas or want to discuss about anything in github discussion
<p><a href=""https://github.com/arghyac35/aria-telegram-mirror-bot/discussions""> <img src=""https://img.shields.io/badge/discussion-gray?style=for-the-badge&logo=github"" width=""150""""/></a></p>
      
## Limitations

This bot is meant to be used in small, closed groups. So, once deployed, it only works in whitelisted groups.

## Heroku

Follow the heroku guide for deployment in heroku
<p><a href=""https://github.com/arghyac35/aria-telegram-mirror-bot/blob/main/heroku_guide.md""> <img src=""https://img.shields.io/badge/Heroku%20guide-blueviolet?style=for-the-badge&logo=heroku"" width=""150""""/></a></p>

## Warning

There is very little preventing users from using this to mirror pirated content. Hence, make sure that only trusted groups are whitelisted in `AUTHORIZED_CHATS`.

## Bot commands

* `/mirror <url>` or `/m <url>`: Download from the given URL and upload it to Google Drive. <url> can be HTTP(S), a BitTorrent magnet, or a HTTP(S) url to a BitTorrent .torrent file. A status message will be shown and updated while downloading.
* `/mirrorTar <url>` or `/mt <url>`: Same as `/mirror`, but archive multiple files into a tar before uploading it.
* `/mirrorStatus` or `/ms`: Send a status message about all active and queued downloads.
* `/cancelMirror` or `/cm`: Cancel a particular mirroring task. Only the person who started the task, SUDO_USERS, and chat admins can use this command. It can be used in below two ways:

      1. Send it as a reply to the message that started the download that you want to cancel.
      2. Use the gid for each download, like `/cancelMirror <gid>` or `/cm <gid>`.
* `/cancelAll` or `/ca`: Cancel all mirroring tasks in all chats if a [SUDO_USERS](#Constants-description) member uses it, or cancel all mirroring tasks for a particular chat if one of that chat's admins use it. No one else can use this command.
* `/list <filename>` or `/l <filename>`: Send links to downloads with the `filename` substring in the name. In case of too many downloads, only show the most recent few. 
* `/getfolder` or `/gf`: Send link of drive mirror folder.
* `/stats`: Send disk information, cpu load of the machine & bot uptime.
* `/getlink <driveUrl>` or `/gl <driveUrl>`: Send index link of the file.
* `/clone <driveUrl>` or `/c <diveUrl>`: Clone any shareable drive link. ~~(TODO: Add service account in it so that if 750GB per account limit is over we can switch to service account.)~~
* `/mirror file` or `/mf`: Forward any torrent file and reply to the forwared message with this command it will start mirroring the torrent.
* `/tar <driveUrl>` or `/t <driveUrl>`: Create a tar of drive folder and upload. This is not yet 100% perfect but does the work. 

      Workflow:
      1. It downlaods each and every files(inside the drive folder) one by one using drive download api. As, it downloads one by one so the overall process is slow.
      2. Creates a tar of the downloaded files.
      3. Uploads the tar.
* `/unzipMirror <url>` or `/um <url>`: Unzip the archive and uploads the unzipped folder. Todo: Show extracted percentage & add support to extract from drive url. Idea taken from: https://github.com/magneto261290/magneto-python-aria

      Supported filetypes:
      .zip, .gz, .bz2, .tar, tar.gz, tar.bz2, .tgz, .tbz2
* `/count <driveUrl>` or `/cnt <driveUrl>`: Obtain informations about a drive folder and send it as a table. Idea taken from: https://github.com/iwestlin/gd-utils/blob/master/count
* `/authorize` or `/a`: To authorize a chat, only run by SUDO_USERS. As this is stored in a file, so might get reset at every restart(not sure tho). To make it sustain need to use a db like redis which I may implement later.
* `/unauthorize` or `/ua`: To unauthorize a chat, only run by SUDO_USERS
* `/restart` or `/r`: Restart Heroku dyno, only run by SUDO_USERS.
* `/help` or `/h`: Sends a list of bot commands

#### Notes

* **All commands can also be called using dot(.) instead of slash(/). For e.x:** `.mirror <url>` or `.m <url>`

* **All commands except** `list` **can have the bot's username appended to them. See** `COMMANDS_USE_BOT_NAME` **under [constants description](#Constants-description).** This is useful if you have multiple instances of this bot in the same group.

* While creating a Telegram bot in the [pre-installation](#Pre-installation]) section below, you might want to add the above commands to your new bot by using `/setcommand` in BotFather, make sure all the commands are in lower case. This will cause a list of available bot commands to pop up in chats when you type `/`, and you can long press one of them to select it instead of typing out the entire command.

## Migrating from v1.0.0

Aria-telegram-mirror-bot is now written in TypeScript. If you are migrating from v1.0.0, move your existing `.constants.js` to `src/.constants.js`, and re-read the [installation section](#Installation) and the [section on updating](#Updating), as some steps have changed.

## Pre-installation

1. [Create a new bot](https://core.telegram.org/bots#3-how-do-i-create-a-bot) using Telegram's BotFather and copy your TOKEN.

2. Add the bot to your groups and optionally, give it the permission to delete messages. This permission is used to clean up status request messages from users. Not granting it will quickly fill the chat with useless messages from users.

3. Install [aria2](https://github.com/aria2/aria2).
   * For Ubuntu:
     `sudo apt install aria2`

4. Get Drive folder ID:

   * Visit [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com).
   * Create a new folder. The bot will upload files inside this folder.
   * Open the folder.
   * The URL will be something like `https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/012a_345bcdefghijk`. Copy the part after `folders/` (`012a_345bcdefghijk`). This is the `GDRIVE_PARENT_DIR_ID` that you'll need in step 5 of the Installation section.

## Installation

1. Install TypeScript with `sudo npm install -g typescript`

2. Clone the repo:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/arghyac35/aria-telegram-mirror-bot
   cd aria-telegram-mirror-bot
   ```

3. Run `npm install`

4. Copy the example files:

   ```bash
   cp src/.constants.js.example src/.constants.js
   ```

5. Configure the bot:

   * `nano src/.constants.js`
   * Now replace the placeholder values in this file with your values. Use the [Constants description](#Constants-description) section below for reference.
   * `MAX_CONCURRENT_DOWNLOADS` is the number of download jobs that can be active at the same time. Note that this does not affect the number of concurrent uploads. Default is set to 5, to change edit `start.sh` file.

6. Compile the project by running `tsc`

7. Set up OAuth:

   * Visit the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials)
   * Go to the OAuth Consent tab, fill it, and save.
   * Go to the Credentials tab and click Create Credentials -> OAuth Client ID
   * Choose Desktop App and Create.
   * Use the download button to download your credentials.
   * Move that file to the root of aria-telegram-mirror-bot, and rename it to `client_secret.json`

8. Enable the Drive API:

   * Visit the [Google API Library](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/library) page.
   * Search for Drive.
   * Make sure that it's enabled. Enable it if not.

9. Start aria2 with `./start.sh`

10. Start the bot with `npm start`

11. Open Telegram, and send `/mirror https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arghyac35/aria-telegram-mirror-bot/master/README.md` to the bot.

12. In the terminal, it'll ask you to visit an authentication URL. Visit it, grant access, copy the code on that page, and paste it in the terminal.

That's it.

## Constants description

This is a description of the fields in src/.constants.js:

* `TOKEN`: This is the Telegram bot token that you will get from Botfather in step 1 of Pre-installation.
* `ARIA_SECRET`: This is the password used to connect to the aria2 RPC. You will get this from step 4 of Installation.
* `ARIA_DOWNLOAD_LOCATION`: This is the directory that aria2 will download files into, before uploading them. Make sure that there is no trailing ""/"" in this path. The suggested path is `/path/to/aria-telegram-mirror-bot/downloads`
* `ARIA_DOWNLOAD_LOCATION_ROOT`: This is the mountpoint that contains ARIA_DOWNLOAD_LOCATION. This is used internally to calculate the space available before downloading.
* `ARIA_FILTERED_DOMAINS`: The bot will refuse to download files from these domains. Can be an empty list.
* `ARIA_FILTERED_FILENAMES`: The bot will refuse to completely download (or if already downloaded, then upload) files with any of these substrings in the file/top level directory name. Can be an empty list or left undefined.
* `ARIA_PORT`: The port for the Aria2c RPC server. If you change this, make sure to update your aria.conf as well. Safe to leave this at the default value unless something else on your system is using that port.
* `GDRIVE_PARENT_DIR_ID`: This is the ID of the Google Drive folder that files will be uploaded into. You will get this from step 4 of Pre-installation.
* `OTHER_GDRIVE_DIR_IDS`: This is needed if u want to look for files in multiple dirs on list command
* `SUDO_USERS`: This is a list of Telegram user IDs. These users can use the bot in any chat. Can be an empty list, if AUTHORIZED_CHATS is not empty.
* `AUTHORIZED_CHATS`: This is a list of Telegram Chat IDs. Anyone in these chats can use the bot in that particular chat. Anyone not in one of these chats and not in SUDO_USERS cannot use the bot. Someone in one of the chats in this list can use the bot only in that chat, not elsewhere. Can be an empty list, if SUDO_USERS is not empty.
* `STATUS_UPDATE_INTERVAL_MS`: Set the time in milliseconds between status updates. A smaller number will update status messages faster, but Telegram will rate limit the bot if it sends/edits more than around 20 messages/minute/chat. As that quota includes messages other than status updates, do not decrease this number if you get rate limit messages in the logs.
* `DRIVE_FILE_PRIVATE`: Files uploaded can either be visible to everyone (public), or be private.
  * `ENABLED`: Set this to `true` to make the uploaded files private. `false` makes uploaded files public.
  * `EMAILS`: An array of email addresses that read access will be granted to. Set this to `[]` to grant access only to the Drive user the bot is set up with.
* `DOWNLOAD_NOTIFY_TARGET`: The fields here are used to notify an external web server once a download is complete. See the [section on notifications below](#Notifying-an-external-webserver-on-download-completion) for details.
   * `enabled`: Set this to `true` to enable this feature.
   * `host`: The address of the web server to notify.
   * `port`: The server port ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
   * `path`: The server path ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
* `COMMANDS_USE_BOT_NAME`: The fields here decide whether to append the bot's usename to the end of commands or not. This works only for group chats, and gets ignored if you PM the bot.
  * `ENABLED`: If `true`, all bot commands have to have the bot's username (as below) appended to them. For example, `/mirror https://someweb.site/resource.tar` will become `/mirror@botName_bot https://someweb.site/resource.tar`. The only exception to this is the `/list` command, which will not have the bot's name appended. This allows having multiple non-conflicting mirror bots in the same group, and have them all reply to `/list`.
  * `NAME`: The username of the bot, as given in BotFather. Include the leading ""@"".
* `IS_TEAM_DRIVE`: Set to `true` if you are mirroring to a Shared Drive.
* `USE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT`: Set to `true` if you want to use Service Accounts to clone, this only works when IS_TEAM_DRIVE is true. Keep all the SAs in accounts folder.
   * TODO: Add script and instructions to generate SAs, for now follow: https://github.com/lzzy12/python-aria-mirror-bot#generating-service-accounts
* `INDEX_DOMAIN`: Link for gdindex
* `TELEGRAPH_TOKEN`: Telegraph token, if you want to show search results in telegra.ph else keep it blank. See [below](#Generating-Telegra.ph-token) for how to generate telegra.ph token.
* `STOP_DUPLICATE_MIRRORS`: Set it to true for stopping duplicate mirrors.

## Generating Telegra.ph token

   ```bash
   npm run generateTelegraphToken
   ```

## Starting after installation

After the initial installation, use these instructions to (re)start the bot.

### Using tmux

1. Start a new tmux session with `tmux new -s tgbot`, or connect to an existing session with `tmux a -t tgbot`. Running the bot inside tmux will let you disconnect from the server without terminating the bot. You can also use nohup instead.
2. Start aria2 by running `./start.sh`
3. Start the bot with `npm start`

### Using systemd

1. Install the systemd unit file `sudo cp -v contrib/mirror-bot.service /etc/systemd/system/`
2. Open `/etc/systemd/system/mirror-bot.service` with an editor of your choice and modify the path and user as per your environment.
3. Reload the systemctl daemon so it can see your new systemd unit `sudo systemctl daemon-reload`
4. Start the service `sudo systemctl start mirror-bot`
5. If you want the bot to automatically start on boot, run `sudo systemctl enable mirror-bot`

## Notifying an external webserver on download completion

This bot can make an HTTP request to an external web server once a download is complete. This can be when a download fails to start, fails to download, is cancelled, or completes successfully. See the section [on constants](#Constants-description) for details on how to configure it.

Your web server should listen for a POST request containing the following JSON data:

```
{
    'successful': boolean,
    'file': {
        'name': string,
        'driveURL': string,
        'size': string
    },
    originGroup: number
}
```

* `successful`: `true` if the download completed successfully, `false` otherwise
* `file`: Details about the file.
   * `name`: The name of the file. Might or might not be present if `successful` is `false`.
   * `driveURL`: The Google Drive download link to the downloaded file. Might or might not be present if `successful` is `false`.
   * `size`: A human-readable file size. Might or might not be present if `successful` is `false`.
* `originGroup`:  The Telegram chat ID for the chat the download was started in

If `successful` is false, any or all of the fields of `file` might be absent. However, if present, they are correct/reliable.

## Updating

Run `git pull`, then run `tsc`. After compilation has finished, you can start the bot as described in [the above section](#Starting-after-installation).

## Common issues

* **`tsc` silently dies, says, ""Killed"", or stays stuck forever:** Your machine does not have enough RAM. tsc needs at least 1GB. Increase your RAM if running on the cloud, or try  setting up a [swap](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-add-swap-space-on-ubuntu-16-04) with a high swappiness.

* **Trying to download anything gives a ""Failed to start the download. Unauthorized"" message:** [See #38](https://github.com/out386/aria-telegram-mirror-bot/issues/38). If it still doesn't work, something else might be running an aria2 RPC at the same port as the bot. Change [`ARIA_PORT`](#Constants-description) and try [#38](https://github.com/out386/aria-telegram-mirror-bot/issues/38) again.

* **`tsc` gives errors like `Property 'SOMETHING' does not exist on type<...>` with red lines under `constants.<...>`:** Some new configs were added to [constants](#Constants-description) after you set up the bot, but your existing `./src/.constants.js` does not have them. Re-read [the constants section](#Constants-description), and add whatever property was added. Usually, you can also just ignore these particular errors and keep using the bot, because `tsc` will compile anyway, and there are default options that are used if you did not update your `.constants.js`.

* **Cannot get public links for folders if using Shared Drives**: Shared Drives do not support sharing folders to non members. The download link the bot gives only works for members of the Shared drive. If you need public links, use `/mirrorTar` to mirror the folder as a single file instead.  
<font size=2>This feature is planned. See [upcoming releases](https://support.google.com/a/table/7539891) (search for ""Folder sharing in shared drives"").</font>

# Some Info about the C&C

The C&C is a program, You can compile it for Windows, Linux, Mac systems. Its a self-running web-server that handles all connections on the selected port in the settings. it will serve the HTLM C&C to a connector if you allow it and it saves data about account, bots and commands as a SQL database and bots files (screenshots, keylogs, ect) as file under the bots own ""Profile""  
You can control the botnet from the program(more secure) or control it from the HTML C&C. The C&C's program is extremely stable, Go based servers are know for handling millions or requests at once without fail, just make sure you have a good connection.  
The C&C has a build in hard-coded login (kinda like a Backdoor) you can use if you 'forgot' the account login. the C&C can have any number of accounts.  
With it being a self-contained program this removes the issue of SQLi attacks on the C&C so its more SECURE.  
The C&C can also run inside a Tor Hidden service if configured right and the client (bot) can connect to it using a onion.to or onion.cab forwarder if needed. Tor can also be used by the bot via a SOCKS proxy... Simple to do, Google it.

# How to Build and Use

Bot Settings are located in ""Variables.go"" Server Setting are located in ""Server.go""

Compile GoBot.go with correct settings, Make a MySQL Database and import db file, Compile Server.go with correct settings

*   go build -o GoBot.exe -ldflags ""-H windowsgui"" ""C:\\GoBot2\\GoBot.go""
*   go build -0 Server.exe ""C:\\GoBot2\\Console Server\\Server.go""

Always compile with '-w -s' ldflags to strip any debug information from the binary.

# Included Tools

*   Tool for the project (Obfuscator (Char+1) and other crap. w/ source in VB.net)
*   Downloader.go (GoLANG Download and Run Example)
*   DownloaderWithUAC.go (GoLANG Download and Run Example with UAC Bypass)

# Obfuscator

It not really a Obfuscator all it does it move the Char +1 to and A = B, C = D, ect. Simple but it will slow down people wanting to mess with the program and also programs that search for keywords...

<p align=""center"">Easy way to make Bottom Sheet with animation</p>
<p align=""center""><a href=""https://github.com/heyalex/BottomDrawer"" target=""_blank""><img width=""250""src=""raw/sample_google_task.gif""></a></p>

## Usage
To customize Bottom Drawer you need to define a new style with extending BottomDialogTheme

You can use the following properties in your BottomDrawer Theme.

| Properties                                 | Type                              | Default |
| ------------------------                   | --------------------------------- | ------- |
| `should_draw_under_status_bar`             | boolean                           | false   |
| `should_draw_content_under_handle_view`    | boolean                           | false   |
| `bottom_sheet_corner_radius`               | dimension                         | 10dp    |
| `bottom_sheet_extra_padding`               | dimension                         | 4dp     |
| `bottom_drawer_background`                 | color                             | WHITE   |


It will be something like:
```xml
<style name=""CustomTheme"" parent=""BottomDialogTheme"">
      <item name=""bottom_sheet_extra_padding"">4dp</item>
      <item name=""should_draw_under_status_bar"">true</item>
</style>
```
You can make your own HandleView and implement TranslationUpdater interface for getting callbacks.
Or you can use defined handle views by library like PlainHandleView or PullHandleView (check sample app).

After customizing theme and choosing handle view, you need to override configureBottomDrawer method and pass theme, handle view to BottomDrawerFragment.

So the following example will make Google Tasks fragment like on main preview:
```kotlin
class GoogleTaskExampleDialog : BottomDrawerFragment() {

    override fun onCreateView(inflater: LayoutInflater, container: ViewGroup?, savedInstanceState: Bundle?): View? {
        super.onCreateView(inflater, container, savedInstanceState)
        return inflater.inflate(R.layout.your_layout, container, false)
    }

    override fun configureBottomDrawer(): BottomDrawerDialog {
        return BottomDrawerDialog.build(context!!) {
            theme = R.style.Plain
            //configure handle view
            handleView = PlainHandleView(context).apply {
                val widthHandle =
                    resources.getDimensionPixelSize(R.dimen.bottom_sheet_handle_width)
                val heightHandle =
                    resources.getDimensionPixelSize(R.dimen.bottom_sheet_handle_height)
                val params =
                    FrameLayout.LayoutParams(widthHandle, heightHandle, Gravity.CENTER_HORIZONTAL)

                params.topMargin =
                    resources.getDimensionPixelSize(R.dimen.bottom_sheet_handle_top_margin)

                layoutParams = params
            }
        }
    }
}
```


You also can change color and corner by code in BottomDrawerFragment:
```kotlin
changeCornerRadius(radius: Float)
changeBackgroundColor(color: Int)
```

## Samples
You can find more samples in app module, to understand functionality of library.

As part of our project, we implemented bottom up attention as a strong VQA baseline. We were planning to integrate object
detection with VQA and were very glad to see that Peter Anderson and
Damien Teney et al. had already done that beautifully.
We hope this clean and
efficient implementation can serve as a useful baseline for future VQA
explorations.

## Implementation Details

Our implementation follows the overall structure of the papers but with
the following simplifications:

1. We don't use extra data from [Visual Genome](http://visualgenome.org/).
2. We use only a fixed number of objects per image (K=36).
3. We use a simple, single stream classifier without pre-training.
4. We use the simple ReLU activation instead of gated tanh.

The first two points greatly reduce the training time. Our
implementation takes around 200 seconds per epoch on a single Titan Xp while
the one described in the paper takes 1 hour per epoch.

The third point is simply because we feel the two stream classifier
and pre-training in the original paper is over-complicated and not
necessary.

For the non-linear activation unit, we tried gated tanh but couldn't
make it work. We also tried gated linear unit (GLU) and it works better than
ReLU. Eventually we choose ReLU due to its simplicity and since the gain
from using GLU is too small to justify the fact that GLU doubles the
number of parameters.

With these simplifications we would expect the performance to drop. For
reference, the best result on validation set reported in the paper is
63.15. The reported result without extra data from visual genome is
62.48, the result using only 36 objects per image is 62.82, the result
using two steam classifier but not pre-trained is 62.28 and the result
using ReLU is 61.63. These numbers are cited from the Table 1 of the
paper: ""Tips and Tricks for Visual Question Answering: Learnings from
the 2017 Challenge"". With all the above simplification aggregated, our
first implementation got around 59-60 on validation set.

To shrink the gap, we added some simple but powerful
modifications. Including:

1. Add dropout to alleviate overfitting
2. Double the number of neurons
3. Add weight normalization (BN seems not work well here)
4. Switch to Adamax optimizer
5. Gradient clipping

These small modifications bring the number back to ~62.80.  We further
change the concatenation based attention module in the original paper
to a projection based module. This new attention module is inspired by
the paper ""Modeling Relationships in Referential Expressions with
Compositional Modular Networks""
(https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.09978.pdf), but with some modifications
(implemented in attention.NewAttention).  With
the help of this new attention, we boost the performance to ~63.58,
surpassing the reported best result with no extra data and less
computation cost.

Bottleneck is a lightweight and zero-dependency Task Scheduler and Rate Limiter for Node.js and the browser.

Bottleneck is an easy solution as it adds very little complexity to your code. It is battle-hardened, reliable and production-ready and used on a large scale in private companies and open source software.

It supports **Clustering**: it can rate limit jobs across multiple Node.js instances. It uses Redis and strictly atomic operations to stay reliable in the presence of unreliable clients and networks. It also supports *Redis Cluster* and *Redis Sentinel*.

## Install

```
npm install --save bottleneck
```

```js
import Bottleneck from ""bottleneck"";

// Note: To support older browsers and Node <6.0, you must import the ES5 bundle instead.
var Bottleneck = require(""bottleneck/es5"");
```

## Quick Start

### Step 1 of 3

Most APIs have a rate limit. For example, to execute 3 requests per second:
```js
const limiter = new Bottleneck({
  minTime: 333
});
```

If there's a chance some requests might take longer than 333ms and you want to prevent more than 1 request from running at a time, add `maxConcurrent: 1`:
```js
const limiter = new Bottleneck({
  maxConcurrent: 1,
  minTime: 333
});
```

`minTime` and `maxConcurrent` are enough for the majority of use cases. They work well together to ensure a smooth rate of requests. If your use case requires executing requests in **bursts** or every time a quota resets, look into [Reservoir Intervals](#reservoir-intervals).

### Step 2 of 3

#### ➤ Using promises?

Instead of this:
```js
myFunction(arg1, arg2)
.then((result) => {
  /* handle result */
});
```
Do this:
```js
limiter.schedule(() => myFunction(arg1, arg2))
.then((result) => {
  /* handle result */
});
```
Or this:
```js
const wrapped = limiter.wrap(myFunction);

wrapped(arg1, arg2)
.then((result) => {
  /* handle result */
});
```

#### ➤ Using async/await?

Instead of this:
```js
const result = await myFunction(arg1, arg2);
```
Do this:
```js
const result = await limiter.schedule(() => myFunction(arg1, arg2));
```
Or this:
```js
const wrapped = limiter.wrap(myFunction);

const result = await wrapped(arg1, arg2);
```

#### ➤ Using callbacks?

Instead of this:
```js
someAsyncCall(arg1, arg2, callback);
```
Do this:
```js
limiter.submit(someAsyncCall, arg1, arg2, callback);
```

### Step 3 of 3

Remember...

Bottleneck builds a queue of jobs and executes them as soon as possible. By default, the jobs will be executed in the order they were received.

**Read the 'Gotchas' and you're good to go**. Or keep reading to learn about all the fine tuning and advanced options available. If your rate limits need to be enforced across a cluster of computers, read the [Clustering](#clustering) docs.

[Need help debugging your application?](#debugging-your-application)

Instead of throttling maybe [you want to batch up requests](#batching) into fewer calls?

### Gotchas & Common Mistakes

* Make sure the function you pass to `schedule()` or `wrap()` only returns once **all the work it does** has completed.

Instead of this:
```js
limiter.schedule(() => {
  tasksArray.forEach(x => processTask(x));
  // BAD, we return before our processTask() functions are finished processing!
});
```
Do this:
```js
limiter.schedule(() => {
  const allTasks = tasksArray.map(x => processTask(x));
  // GOOD, we wait until all tasks are done.
  return Promise.all(allTasks);
});
```

* If you're passing an object's method as a job, you'll probably need to `bind()` the object:
```js
// instead of this:
limiter.schedule(object.doSomething);
// do this:
limiter.schedule(object.doSomething.bind(object));
// or, wrap it in an arrow function instead:
limiter.schedule(() => object.doSomething());
```

* Bottleneck requires Node 6+ to function. However, an ES5 build is included: `var Bottleneck = require(""bottleneck/es5"");`.

* Make sure you're catching `""error""` events emitted by your limiters!

* Consider setting a `maxConcurrent` value instead of leaving it `null`. This can help your application's performance, especially if you think the limiter's queue might become very long.

* If you plan on using `priorities`, make sure to set a `maxConcurrent` value.

* **When using `submit()`**, if a callback isn't necessary, you must pass `null` or an empty function instead. It will not work otherwise.

* **When using `submit()`**, make sure all the jobs will eventually complete by calling their callback, or set an [`expiration`](#job-options). Even if you submitted your job with a `null` callback , it still needs to call its callback. This is particularly important if you are using a `maxConcurrent` value that isn't `null` (unlimited), otherwise those not completed jobs will be clogging up the limiter and no new jobs will be allowed to run. It's safe to call the callback more than once, subsequent calls are ignored.

* Using tools like `mockdate` in your tests to change time in JavaScript will likely result in undefined behavior from Bottleneck.

## Docs

### Constructor

```js
const limiter = new Bottleneck({/* options */});
```

Basic options:

| Option | Default | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `maxConcurrent` | `null` (unlimited) | How many jobs can be executing at the same time. Consider setting a value instead of leaving it `null`, it can help your application's performance, especially if you think the limiter's queue might get very long. |
| `minTime` | `0` ms | How long to wait after launching a job before launching another one. |
| `highWater` | `null` (unlimited) | How long can the queue be? When the queue length exceeds that value, the selected `strategy` is executed to shed the load. |
| `strategy` | `Bottleneck.strategy.LEAK` | Which strategy to use when the queue gets longer than the high water mark. [Read about strategies](#strategies). Strategies are never executed if `highWater` is `null`. |
| `penalty` | `15 * minTime`, or `5000` when `minTime` is `0` | The `penalty` value used by the `BLOCK` strategy. |
| `reservoir` | `null` (unlimited) | How many jobs can be executed before the limiter stops executing jobs. If `reservoir` reaches `0`, no jobs will be executed until it is no longer `0`. New jobs will still be queued up. |
| `reservoirRefreshInterval` | `null` (disabled) | Every `reservoirRefreshInterval` milliseconds, the `reservoir` value will be automatically updated to the value of `reservoirRefreshAmount`. The `reservoirRefreshInterval` value should be a [multiple of 250 (5000 for Clustering)](https://github.com/SGrondin/bottleneck/issues/88). |
| `reservoirRefreshAmount` | `null` (disabled) | The value to set `reservoir` to when `reservoirRefreshInterval` is in use. |
| `reservoirIncreaseInterval` | `null` (disabled) | Every `reservoirIncreaseInterval` milliseconds, the `reservoir` value will be automatically incremented by `reservoirIncreaseAmount`. The `reservoirIncreaseInterval` value should be a [multiple of 250 (5000 for Clustering)](https://github.com/SGrondin/bottleneck/issues/88). |
| `reservoirIncreaseAmount` | `null` (disabled) | The increment applied to `reservoir` when `reservoirIncreaseInterval` is in use. |
| `reservoirIncreaseMaximum` | `null` (disabled) | The maximum value that `reservoir` can reach when `reservoirIncreaseInterval` is in use. |
| `Promise` | `Promise` (built-in) | This lets you override the Promise library used by Bottleneck. |


### Reservoir Intervals

Reservoir Intervals let you execute requests in bursts, by automatically controlling the limiter's `reservoir` value. The `reservoir` is simply the number of jobs the limiter is allowed to execute. Once the value reaches 0, it stops starting new jobs.

There are 2 types of Reservoir Intervals: Refresh Intervals and Increase Intervals.

#### Refresh Interval

In this example, we throttle to 100 requests every 60 seconds:

```js
const limiter = new Bottleneck({
  reservoir: 100, // initial value
  reservoirRefreshAmount: 100,
  reservoirRefreshInterval: 60 * 1000, // must be divisible by 250

  // also use maxConcurrent and/or minTime for safety
  maxConcurrent: 1,
  minTime: 333 // pick a value that makes sense for your use case
});
```
`reservoir` is a counter decremented every time a job is launched, we set its initial value to 100. Then, every `reservoirRefreshInterval` (60000 ms), `reservoir` is automatically updated to be equal to the `reservoirRefreshAmount` (100).

#### Increase Interval

In this example, we throttle jobs to meet the Shopify API Rate Limits. Users are allowed to send 40 requests initially, then every second grants 2 more requests up to a maximum of 40.

```js
const limiter = new Bottleneck({
  reservoir: 40, // initial value
  reservoirIncreaseAmount: 2,
  reservoirIncreaseInterval: 1000, // must be divisible by 250
  reservoirIncreaseMaximum: 40,

  // also use maxConcurrent and/or minTime for safety
  maxConcurrent: 5,
  minTime: 250 // pick a value that makes sense for your use case
});
```

#### Warnings

Reservoir Intervals are an advanced feature, please take the time to read and understand the following warnings.

- **Reservoir Intervals are not a replacement for `minTime` and `maxConcurrent`.** It's strongly recommended to also use `minTime` and/or `maxConcurrent` to spread out the load. For example, suppose a lot of jobs are queued up because the `reservoir` is 0. Every time the Refresh Interval is triggered, a number of jobs equal to `reservoirRefreshAmount` will automatically be launched, all at the same time! To prevent this flooding effect and keep your application running smoothly, use `minTime` and `maxConcurrent` to **stagger** the jobs.

- **The Reservoir Interval starts from the moment the limiter is created**. Let's suppose we're using `reservoirRefreshAmount: 5`. If you happen to add 10 jobs just 1ms before the refresh is triggered, the first 5 will run immediately, then 1ms later it will refresh the reservoir value and that will make the last 5 also run right away. It will have run 10 jobs in just over 1ms no matter what your reservoir interval was!

- **Reservoir Intervals prevent a limiter from being garbage collected.** Call `limiter.disconnect()` to clear the interval and allow the memory to be freed. However, it's not necessary to call `.disconnect()` to allow the Node.js process to exit.

### submit()

Adds a job to the queue. This is the callback version of `schedule()`.
```js
limiter.submit(someAsyncCall, arg1, arg2, callback);
```
You can pass `null` instead of an empty function if there is no callback, but `someAsyncCall` still needs to call **its** callback to let the limiter know it has completed its work.

`submit()` can also accept [advanced options](#job-options).

### schedule()

Adds a job to the queue. This is the Promise and async/await version of `submit()`.
```js
const fn = function(arg1, arg2) {
  return httpGet(arg1, arg2); // Here httpGet() returns a promise
};

limiter.schedule(fn, arg1, arg2)
.then((result) => {
  /* ... */
});
```
In other words, `schedule()` takes a function **fn** and a list of arguments. `schedule()` returns a promise that will be executed according to the rate limits.

`schedule()` can also accept [advanced options](#job-options).

Here's another example:
```js
// suppose that `client.get(url)` returns a promise

const url = ""https://wikipedia.org"";

limiter.schedule(() => client.get(url))
.then(response => console.log(response.body));
```

### wrap()

Takes a function that returns a promise. Returns a function identical to the original, but rate limited.
```js
const wrapped = limiter.wrap(fn);

wrapped()
.then(function (result) {
  /* ... */
})
.catch(function (error) {
  // Bottleneck might need to fail the job even if the original function can never fail.
  // For example, your job is taking longer than the `expiration` time you've set.
});
```

### Job Options

`submit()`, `schedule()`, and `wrap()` all accept advanced options.
```js
// Submit
limiter.submit({/* options */}, someAsyncCall, arg1, arg2, callback);

// Schedule
limiter.schedule({/* options */}, fn, arg1, arg2);

// Wrap
const wrapped = limiter.wrap(fn);
wrapped.withOptions({/* options */}, arg1, arg2);
```

| Option | Default | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `priority` | `5` | A priority between `0` and `9`. A job with a priority of `4` will be queued ahead of a job with a priority of `5`. **Important:** You must set a low `maxConcurrent` value for priorities to work, otherwise there is nothing to queue because jobs will be be scheduled immediately! |
| `weight` | `1` | Must be an integer equal to or higher than `0`. The `weight` is what increases the number of running jobs (up to `maxConcurrent`) and decreases the `reservoir` value. |
| `expiration` | `null` (unlimited) | The number of milliseconds a job is given to complete. Jobs that execute for longer than `expiration` ms will be failed with a `BottleneckError`. |
| `id` | `<no-id>` | You should give an ID to your jobs, it helps with [debugging](#debugging-your-application). |

### Strategies

A strategy is a simple algorithm that is executed every time adding a job would cause the number of queued jobs to exceed `highWater`. Strategies are never executed if `highWater` is `null`.

#### Bottleneck.strategy.LEAK
When adding a new job to a limiter, if the queue length reaches `highWater`, drop the oldest job with the lowest priority. This is useful when jobs that have been waiting for too long are not important anymore. If all the queued jobs are more important (based on their `priority` value) than the one being added, it will not be added.

#### Bottleneck.strategy.OVERFLOW_PRIORITY
Same as `LEAK`, except it will only drop jobs that are *less important* than the one being added. If all the queued jobs are as or more important than the new one, it will not be added.

#### Bottleneck.strategy.OVERFLOW
When adding a new job to a limiter, if the queue length reaches `highWater`, do not add the new job. This strategy totally ignores priority levels.

#### Bottleneck.strategy.BLOCK
When adding a new job to a limiter, if the queue length reaches `highWater`, the limiter falls into ""blocked mode"". All queued jobs are dropped and no new jobs will be accepted until the limiter unblocks. It will unblock after `penalty` milliseconds have passed without receiving a new job. `penalty` is equal to `15 * minTime` (or `5000` if `minTime` is `0`) by default. This strategy is ideal when bruteforce attacks are to be expected. This strategy totally ignores priority levels.


### Jobs lifecycle

1. **Received**. Your new job has been added to the limiter. Bottleneck needs to check whether it can be accepted into the queue.
2. **Queued**. Bottleneck has accepted your job, but it can not tell at what exact timestamp it will run yet, because it is dependent on previous jobs.
3. **Running**. Your job is not in the queue anymore, it will be executed after a delay that was computed according to your `minTime` setting.
4. **Executing**. Your job is executing its code.
5. **Done**. Your job has completed.

**Note:** By default, Bottleneck does not keep track of DONE jobs, to save memory. You can enable this feature by passing `trackDoneStatus: true` as an option when creating a limiter.

#### counts()

```js
const counts = limiter.counts();

console.log(counts);
/*
{
  RECEIVED: 0,
  QUEUED: 0,
  RUNNING: 0,
  EXECUTING: 0,
  DONE: 0
}
*/
```

Returns an object with the current number of jobs per status in the limiter.

#### jobStatus()

```js
console.log(limiter.jobStatus(""some-job-id""));
// Example: QUEUED
```

Returns the status of the job with the provided job id **in the limiter**. Returns `null` if no job with that id exist.

#### jobs()

```js
console.log(limiter.jobs(""RUNNING""));
// Example: ['id1', 'id2']
```

Returns an array of all the job ids with the specified status **in the limiter**. Not passing a status string returns all the known ids.

#### queued()

```js
const count = limiter.queued(priority);

console.log(count);
```

`priority` is optional. Returns the number of `QUEUED` jobs with the given `priority` level. Omitting the `priority` argument returns the total number of queued jobs **in the limiter**.

#### clusterQueued()

```js
const count = await limiter.clusterQueued();

console.log(count);
```

Returns the number of `QUEUED` jobs **in the Cluster**.

#### empty()

```js
if (limiter.empty()) {
  // do something...
}
```

Returns a boolean which indicates whether there are any `RECEIVED` or `QUEUED` jobs **in the limiter**.

#### running()

```js
limiter.running()
.then((count) => console.log(count));
```

Returns a promise that returns the **total weight** of the `RUNNING` and `EXECUTING` jobs **in the Cluster**.

#### done()

```js
limiter.done()
.then((count) => console.log(count));
```

Returns a promise that returns the **total weight** of `DONE` jobs **in the Cluster**. Does not require passing the `trackDoneStatus: true` option.

#### check()

```js
limiter.check()
.then((wouldRunNow) => console.log(wouldRunNow));
```
Checks if a new job would be executed immediately if it was submitted now. Returns a promise that returns a boolean.


### Events

__'error'__
```js
limiter.on(""error"", function (error) {
  /* handle errors here */
});
```

The two main causes of error events are: uncaught exceptions in your event handlers, and network errors when Clustering is enabled.

__'failed'__
```js
limiter.on(""failed"", function (error, jobInfo) {
  // This will be called every time a job fails.
});
```

__'retry'__

See [Retries](#retries) to learn how to automatically retry jobs.
```js
limiter.on(""retry"", function (message, jobInfo) {
  // This will be called every time a job is retried.
});
```

__'empty'__
```js
limiter.on(""empty"", function () {
  // This will be called when `limiter.empty()` becomes true.
});
```

__'idle'__
```js
limiter.on(""idle"", function () {
  // This will be called when `limiter.empty()` is `true` and `limiter.running()` is `0`.
});
```

__'dropped'__
```js
limiter.on(""dropped"", function (dropped) {
  // This will be called when a strategy was triggered.
  // The dropped request is passed to this event listener.
});
```

__'depleted'__
```js
limiter.on(""depleted"", function (empty) {
  // This will be called every time the reservoir drops to 0.
  // The `empty` (boolean) argument indicates whether `limiter.empty()` is currently true.
});
```

__'debug'__
```js
limiter.on(""debug"", function (message, data) {
  // Useful to figure out what the limiter is doing in real time
  // and to help debug your application
});
```

__'received'__
__'queued'__
__'scheduled'__
__'executing'__
__'done'__
```js
limiter.on(""queued"", function (info) {
  // This event is triggered when a job transitions from one Lifecycle stage to another
});
```

See [Jobs Lifecycle](#jobs-lifecycle) for more information.

These Lifecycle events are not triggered for jobs located on another limiter in a Cluster, for performance reasons.

#### Other event methods

Use `removeAllListeners()` with an optional event name as first argument to remove listeners.

Use `.once()` instead of `.on()` to only receive a single event.


### Retries

The following example:
```js
const limiter = new Bottleneck();

// Listen to the ""failed"" event
limiter.on(""failed"", async (error, jobInfo) => {
  const id = jobInfo.options.id;
  console.warn(`Job ${id} failed: ${error}`);

  if (jobInfo.retryCount === 0) { // Here we only retry once
    console.log(`Retrying job ${id} in 25ms!`);
    return 25;
  }
});

// Listen to the ""retry"" event
limiter.on(""retry"", (error, jobInfo) => console.log(`Now retrying ${jobInfo.options.id}`));

const main = async function () {
  let executions = 0;

  // Schedule one job
  const result = await limiter.schedule({ id: 'ABC123' }, async () => {
    executions++;
    if (executions === 1) {
      throw new Error(""Boom!"");
    } else {
      return ""Success!"";
    }
  });

  console.log(`Result: ${result}`);
}

main();
```
will output
```
Job ABC123 failed: Error: Boom!
Retrying job ABC123 in 25ms!
Now retrying ABC123
Result: Success!
```
To re-run your job, simply return an integer from the `'failed'` event handler. The number returned is how many milliseconds to wait before retrying it. Return `0` to retry it immediately.

**IMPORTANT:** When you ask the limiter to retry a job it will not send it back into the queue. It will stay in the `EXECUTING` [state](#jobs-lifecycle) until it succeeds or until you stop retrying it. **This means that it counts as a concurrent job for `maxConcurrent` even while it's just waiting to be retried.** The number of milliseconds to wait ignores your `minTime` settings.


### updateSettings()

```js
limiter.updateSettings(options);
```
The options are the same as the [limiter constructor](#constructor).

**Note:** Changes don't affect `SCHEDULED` jobs.

### incrementReservoir()

```js
limiter.incrementReservoir(incrementBy);
```
Returns a promise that returns the new reservoir value.

### currentReservoir()

```js
limiter.currentReservoir()
.then((reservoir) => console.log(reservoir));
```
Returns a promise that returns the current reservoir value.

### stop()

The `stop()` method is used to safely shutdown a limiter. It prevents any new jobs from being added to the limiter and waits for all `EXECUTING` jobs to complete.

```js
limiter.stop(options)
.then(() => {
  console.log(""Shutdown completed!"")
});
```

`stop()` returns a promise that resolves once all the `EXECUTING` jobs have completed and, if desired, once all non-`EXECUTING` jobs have been dropped.

| Option | Default | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `dropWaitingJobs` | `true` | When `true`, drop all the `RECEIVED`, `QUEUED` and `RUNNING` jobs. When `false`, allow those jobs to complete before resolving the Promise returned by this method. |
| `dropErrorMessage` | `This limiter has been stopped.` | The error message used to drop jobs when `dropWaitingJobs` is `true`. |
| `enqueueErrorMessage` | `This limiter has been stopped and cannot accept new jobs.` | The error message used to reject a job added to the limiter after `stop()` has been called. |

### chain()

Tasks that are ready to be executed will be added to that other limiter. Suppose you have 2 types of tasks, A and B. They both have their own limiter with their own settings, but both must also follow a global limiter G:
```js
const limiterA = new Bottleneck( /* some settings */ );
const limiterB = new Bottleneck( /* some different settings */ );
const limiterG = new Bottleneck( /* some global settings */ );

limiterA.chain(limiterG);
limiterB.chain(limiterG);

// Requests added to limiterA must follow the A and G rate limits.
// Requests added to limiterB must follow the B and G rate limits.
// Requests added to limiterG must follow the G rate limits.
```

To unchain, call `limiter.chain(null);`.

## Group

The `Group` feature of Bottleneck manages many limiters automatically for you. It creates limiters dynamically and transparently.

Let's take a DNS server as an example of how Bottleneck can be used. It's a service that sees a lot of abuse and where incoming DNS requests need to be rate limited. Bottleneck is so tiny, it's acceptable to create one limiter for each origin IP, even if it means creating thousands of limiters. The `Group` feature is perfect for this use case. Create one Group and use the origin IP to rate limit each IP independently. Each call with the same key (IP) will be routed to the same underlying limiter. A Group is created like a limiter:


```js
const group = new Bottleneck.Group(options);
```

The `options` object will be used for every limiter created by the Group.

The Group is then used with the `.key(str)` method:

```js
// In this example, the key is an IP
group.key(""77.66.54.32"").schedule(() => {
  /* process the request */
});
```

#### key()

* `str` : The key to use. All jobs added with the same key will use the same underlying limiter. *Default: `""""`*

The return value of `.key(str)` is a limiter. If it doesn't already exist, it is generated for you. Calling `key()` is how limiters are created inside a Group.

Limiters that have been idle for longer than 5 minutes are deleted to avoid memory leaks, this value can be changed by passing a different `timeout` option, in milliseconds.

#### on(""created"")

```js
group.on(""created"", (limiter, key) => {
  console.log(""A new limiter was created for key: "" + key)

  // Prepare the limiter, for example we'll want to listen to its ""error"" events!
  limiter.on(""error"", (err) => {
    // Handle errors here
  })
});
```

Listening for the `""created""` event is the recommended way to set up a new limiter. Your event handler is executed before `key()` returns the newly created limiter.

#### updateSettings()

```js
const group = new Bottleneck.Group({ maxConcurrent: 2, minTime: 250 });
group.updateSettings({ minTime: 500 });
```
After executing the above commands, **new limiters** will be created with `{ maxConcurrent: 2, minTime: 500 }`.


#### deleteKey()

* `str`: The key for the limiter to delete.

Manually deletes the limiter at the specified key. When using Clustering, the Redis data is immediately deleted and the other Groups in the Cluster will eventually delete their local key automatically, unless it is still being used.

#### keys()

Returns an array containing all the keys in the Group.

#### clusterKeys()

Same as `group.keys()`, but returns all keys in this Group ID across the Cluster.

#### limiters()

```js
const limiters = group.limiters();

console.log(limiters);
// [ { key: ""some key"", limiter: <limiter> }, { key: ""some other key"", limiter: <some other limiter> } ]
```

## Batching

Some APIs can accept multiple operations in a single call. Bottleneck's Batching feature helps you take advantage of those APIs:
```js
const batcher = new Bottleneck.Batcher({
  maxTime: 1000,
  maxSize: 10
});

batcher.on(""batch"", (batch) => {
  console.log(batch); // [""some-data"", ""some-other-data""]

  // Handle batch here
});

batcher.add(""some-data"");
batcher.add(""some-other-data"");
```

`batcher.add()` returns a Promise that resolves once the request has been flushed to a `""batch""` event.

| Option | Default | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `maxTime` | `null` (unlimited) | Maximum acceptable time (in milliseconds) a request can have to wait before being flushed to the `""batch""` event. |
| `maxSize` | `null` (unlimited) | Maximum number of requests in a batch. |

Batching doesn't throttle requests, it only groups them up optimally according to your `maxTime` and `maxSize` settings.

## Clustering

Clustering lets many limiters access the same shared state, stored in Redis. Changes to the state are Atomic, Consistent and Isolated (and fully [ACID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID) with the right [Durability](https://redis.io/topics/persistence) configuration), to eliminate any chances of race conditions or state corruption. Your settings, such as `maxConcurrent`, `minTime`, etc., are shared across the whole cluster, which means —for example— that `{ maxConcurrent: 5 }` guarantees no more than 5 jobs can ever run at a time in the entire cluster of limiters. 100% of Bottleneck's features are supported in Clustering mode. Enabling Clustering is as simple as changing a few settings. It's also a convenient way to store or export state for later use.

Bottleneck will attempt to spread load evenly across limiters.

### Enabling Clustering

First, add `redis` or `ioredis` to your application's dependencies:
```bash
# NodeRedis (https://github.com/NodeRedis/node_redis)
npm install --save redis

# or ioredis (https://github.com/luin/ioredis)
npm install --save ioredis
```
Then create a limiter or a Group:
```js
const limiter = new Bottleneck({
  /* Some basic options */
  maxConcurrent: 5,
  minTime: 500
  id: ""my-super-app"" // All limiters with the same id will be clustered together

  /* Clustering options */
  datastore: ""redis"", // or ""ioredis""
  clearDatastore: false,
  clientOptions: {
    host: ""127.0.0.1"",
    port: 6379

    // Redis client options
    // Using NodeRedis? See https://github.com/NodeRedis/node_redis#options-object-properties
    // Using ioredis? See https://github.com/luin/ioredis/blob/master/API.md#new-redisport-host-options
  }
});
```

| Option | Default | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `datastore` | `""local""` | Where the limiter stores its internal state. The default (`""local""`) keeps the state in the limiter itself. Set it to `""redis""` or `""ioredis""` to enable Clustering. |
| `clearDatastore` | `false` | When set to `true`, on initial startup, the limiter will wipe any existing Bottleneck state data on the Redis db. |
| `clientOptions` | `{}` | This object is passed directly to the redis client library you've selected. |
| `clusterNodes` | `null` | **ioredis only.** When `clusterNodes` is not null, the client will be instantiated by calling `new Redis.Cluster(clusterNodes, clientOptions)` instead of `new Redis(clientOptions)`. |
| `timeout` | `null` (no TTL) | The Redis TTL in milliseconds ([TTL](https://redis.io/commands/ttl)) for the keys created by the limiter. When `timeout` is set, the limiter's state will be automatically removed from Redis after `timeout` milliseconds of inactivity. |
| `Redis` | `null` | Overrides the import/require of the redis/ioredis library. You shouldn't need to set this option unless your application is failing to start due to a failure to require/import the client library. |

**Note: When using Groups**, the `timeout` option has a default of `300000` milliseconds and the generated limiters automatically receive an `id` with the pattern `${group.id}-${KEY}`.

**Note:** If you are seeing a runtime error due to the `require()` function not being able to load `redis`/`ioredis`, then directly pass the module as the `Redis` option. Example:
```js
import Redis from ""ioredis""

const limiter = new Bottleneck({
  id: ""my-super-app"",
  datastore: ""ioredis"",
  clientOptions: { host: '12.34.56.78', port: 6379 },
  Redis
});
```
Unfortunately, this is a side effect of having to disable inlining, which is necessary to make Bottleneck easy to use in the browser.

### Important considerations when Clustering

The first limiter connecting to Redis will store its [constructor options](#constructor) on Redis and all subsequent limiters will be using those settings. You can alter the constructor options used by all the connected limiters by calling `updateSettings()`. The `clearDatastore` option instructs a new limiter to wipe any previous Bottleneck data (for that `id`), including previously stored settings.

Queued jobs are **NOT** stored on Redis. They are local to each limiter. Exiting the Node.js process will lose those jobs. This is because Bottleneck has no way to propagate the JS code to run a job across a different Node.js process than the one it originated on. Bottleneck doesn't keep track of the queue contents of the limiters on a cluster for performance and reliability reasons. You can use something like [`BeeQueue`](https://github.com/bee-queue/bee-queue) in addition to Bottleneck to get around this limitation.

Due to the above, functionality relying on the queue length happens purely locally:
- Priorities are local. A higher priority job will run before a lower priority job **on the same limiter**. Another limiter on the cluster might run a lower priority job before our higher priority one.
- Assuming constant priority levels, Bottleneck guarantees that jobs will be run in the order they were received **on the same limiter**. Another limiter on the cluster might run a job received later before ours runs.
- `highWater` and load shedding ([strategies](#strategies)) are per limiter. However, one limiter entering Blocked mode will put the entire cluster in Blocked mode until `penalty` milliseconds have passed. See [Strategies](#strategies).
- The `""empty""` event is triggered when the (local) queue is empty.
- The `""idle""` event is triggered when the (local) queue is empty *and* no jobs are currently running anywhere in the cluster.

You must work around these limitations in your application code if they are an issue to you. The `publish()` method could be useful here.

The current design guarantees reliability, is highly performant and lets limiters come and go. Your application can scale up or down, and clients can be disconnected at any time without issues.

It is **strongly recommended** that you give an `id` to every limiter and Group since it is used to build the name of your limiter's Redis keys! Limiters with the same `id` inside the same Redis db will be sharing the same datastore.

It is **strongly recommended** that you set an `expiration` (See [Job Options](#job-options)) *on every job*, since that lets the cluster recover from crashed or disconnected clients. Otherwise, a client crashing while executing a job would not be able to tell the cluster to decrease its number of ""running"" jobs. By using expirations, those lost jobs are automatically cleared after the specified time has passed. Using expirations is essential to keeping a cluster reliable in the face of unpredictable application bugs, network hiccups, and so on.

Network latency between Node.js and Redis is not taken into account when calculating timings (such as `minTime`). To minimize the impact of latency, Bottleneck only performs a single Redis call per [lifecycle transition](#jobs-lifecycle). Keeping the Redis server close to your limiters will help you get a more consistent experience. Keeping the system time consistent across all clients will also help.

It is **strongly recommended** to [set up an `""error""` listener](#events) on all your limiters and on your Groups.

### Clustering Methods

The `ready()`, `publish()` and `clients()` methods also exist when using the `local` datastore, for code compatibility reasons: code written for `redis`/`ioredis` won't break with `local`.

#### ready()

This method returns a promise that resolves once the limiter is connected to Redis.

As of v2.9.0, it's no longer necessary to wait for `.ready()` to resolve before issuing commands to a limiter. The commands will be queued until the limiter successfully connects. Make sure to listen to the `""error""` event to handle connection errors.

```js
const limiter = new Bottleneck({/* options */});

limiter.on(""error"", (err) => {
  // handle network errors
});

limiter.ready()
.then(() => {
  // The limiter is ready
});
```

#### publish(message)

This method broadcasts the `message` string to every limiter in the Cluster. It returns a promise.
```js
const limiter = new Bottleneck({/* options */});

limiter.on(""message"", (msg) => {
  console.log(msg); // prints ""this is a string""
});

limiter.publish(""this is a string"");
```

To send objects, stringify them first:
```js
limiter.on(""message"", (msg) => {
  console.log(JSON.parse(msg).hello) // prints ""world""
});

limiter.publish(JSON.stringify({ hello: ""world"" }));
```

#### clients()

If you need direct access to the redis clients, use `.clients()`:
```js
console.log(limiter.clients());
// { client: <Redis Client>, subscriber: <Redis Client> }
```

### Additional Clustering information

- Bottleneck is compatible with [Redis Clusters](https://redis.io/topics/cluster-tutorial), but you must use the `ioredis` datastore and the `clusterNodes` option.
- Bottleneck is compatible with Redis Sentinel, but you must use the `ioredis` datastore.
- Bottleneck's data is stored in Redis keys starting with `b_`. It also uses pubsub channels starting with `b_` It will not interfere with any other data stored on the server.
- Bottleneck loads a few Lua scripts on the Redis server using the `SCRIPT LOAD` command. These scripts only take up a few Kb of memory. Running the `SCRIPT FLUSH` command will cause any connected limiters to experience critical errors until a new limiter connects to Redis and loads the scripts again.
- The Lua scripts are highly optimized and designed to use as few resources as possible.

### Managing Redis Connections

Bottleneck needs to create 2 Redis Clients to function, one for normal operations and one for pubsub subscriptions. These 2 clients are kept in a `Bottleneck.RedisConnection` (NodeRedis) or a `Bottleneck.IORedisConnection` (ioredis) object, referred to as the Connection object.

By default, every Group and every standalone limiter (a limiter not created by a Group) will create their own Connection object, but it is possible to manually control this behavior. In this example, every Group and limiter is sharing the same Connection object and therefore the same 2 clients:
```js
const connection = new Bottleneck.RedisConnection({
  clientOptions: {/* NodeRedis/ioredis options */}
  // ioredis also accepts `clusterNodes` here
});


const limiter = new Bottleneck({ connection: connection });
const group = new Bottleneck.Group({ connection: connection });
```
You can access and reuse the Connection object of any Group or limiter:
```js
const group = new Bottleneck.Group({ connection: limiter.connection });
```
When a Connection object is created manually, the connectivity `""error""` events are emitted on the Connection itself.
```js
connection.on(""error"", (err) => { /* handle connectivity errors here */ });
```
If you already have a NodeRedis/ioredis client, you can ask Bottleneck to reuse it, although currently the Connection object will still create a second client for pubsub operations:
```js
import Redis from ""redis"";
const client = new Redis.createClient({/* options */});

const connection = new Bottleneck.RedisConnection({
  // `clientOptions` and `clusterNodes` will be ignored since we're passing a raw client
  client: client
});

const limiter = new Bottleneck({ connection: connection });
const group = new Bottleneck.Group({ connection: connection });
```
Depending on your application, using more clients can improve performance.

Use the `disconnect(flush)` method to close the Redis clients.
```js
limiter.disconnect();
group.disconnect();
```
If you created the Connection object manually, you need to call `connection.disconnect()` instead, for safety reasons.

## Debugging your application

Debugging complex scheduling logic can be difficult, especially when priorities, weights, and network latency all interact with one another.

If your application is not behaving as expected, start by making sure you're catching `""error""` [events emitted](#events) by your limiters and your Groups. Those errors are most likely uncaught exceptions from your application code.

Make sure you've read the ['Gotchas'](#gotchas) section.

To see exactly what a limiter is doing in real time, listen to the `""debug""` event. It contains detailed information about how the limiter is executing your code. Adding [job IDs](#job-options) to all your jobs makes the debug output more readable.

When Bottleneck has to fail one of your jobs, it does so by using `BottleneckError` objects. This lets you tell those errors apart from your own code's errors:
```js
limiter.schedule(fn)
.then((result) => { /* ... */ } )
.catch((error) => {
  if (error instanceof Bottleneck.BottleneckError) {
    /* ... */
  }
});
```

## Upgrading to v2

The internal algorithms essentially haven't changed from v1, but many small changes to the interface were made to introduce new features.

All the breaking changes:
- Bottleneck v2 requires Node 6+ or a modern browser. Use `require(""bottleneck/es5"")` if you need ES5 support in v2. Bottleneck v1 will continue to use ES5 only.
- The Bottleneck constructor now takes an options object. See [Constructor](#constructor).
- The `Cluster` feature is now called `Group`. This is to distinguish it from the new v2 [Clustering](#clustering) feature.
- The `Group` constructor takes an options object to match the limiter constructor.
- Jobs take an optional options object. See [Job options](#job-options).
- Removed `submitPriority()`, use `submit()` with an options object instead.
- Removed `schedulePriority()`, use `schedule()` with an options object instead.
- The `rejectOnDrop` option is now `true` by default. It can be set to `false` if you wish to retain v1 behavior. However this option is left undocumented as enabling it is considered to be a poor practice.
- Use `null` instead of `0` to indicate an unlimited `maxConcurrent` value.
- Use `null` instead of `-1` to indicate an unlimited `highWater` value.
- Renamed `changeSettings()` to `updateSettings()`, it now returns a promise to indicate completion. It takes the same options object as the constructor.
- Renamed `nbQueued()` to `queued()`.
- Renamed `nbRunning` to `running()`, it now returns its result using a promise.
- Removed `isBlocked()`.
- Changing the Promise library is now done through the options object like any other limiter setting.
- Removed `changePenalty()`, it is now done through the options object like any other limiter setting.
- Removed `changeReservoir()`, it is now done through the options object like any other limiter setting.
- Removed `stopAll()`. Use the new `stop()` method.
- `check()` now accepts an optional `weight` argument, and returns its result using a promise.
- Removed the `Group` `changeTimeout()` method. Instead, pass a `timeout` option when creating a Group.

Version 2 is more user-friendly and powerful.

After upgrading your code, please take a minute to read the [Debugging your application](#debugging-your-application) chapter.


## Contributing

This README is always in need of improvements. If wording can be clearer and simpler, please consider forking this repo and submitting a Pull Request, or simply opening an issue.

Suggestions and bug reports are also welcome.

To work on the Bottleneck code, simply clone the repo, makes your changes to the files located in `src/` only, then run `./scripts/build.sh && npm test` to ensure that everything is set up correctly.

To speed up compilation time during development, run `./scripts/build.sh dev` instead. Make sure to build and test without `dev` before submitting a PR.

The tests must also pass in Clustering mode and using the ES5 bundle. You'll need a Redis server running locally (latency needs to be minimal to run the tests). If the server isn't using the default hostname and port, you can set those in the `.env` file. Then run `./scripts/build.sh && npm run test-all`.

All contributions are appreciated and will be considered.

353,353,microsoft/BotBuilder-Location,C#,"# Microsoft Location Control for Microsoft Bot Framework

## Overview
The Microsoft location control for Microsoft Bot Framework makes the process of collecting and validating the user's desired location in a conversation easy and reliable. The control is available for C# and Node.js and works consistently across all channels supported by Bot Framework. 

![Location Control Top Screenshot](Images/skype_multiaddress_1.png)

## Use Case and Features
Bots often need the user's location to complete a task. For example, a Taxi bot requires the user's pickup and destination address before requesting a ride. Similarly, a Pizza bot must know the user's delivery address to submit the order, and so on. Normally, bot developers need to use a combination of location or place APIs, and have their bots engage in a multi-turn dialog with users to get their desired location and subsequently validate it. The development steps are usually complicated and error-prone.  

The Microsoft location control makes this process easy by abstracting away the tedious coding steps to let the user pick a location and reliably validate it. The control offers the following capabilities: 

- Address look up and validation using the REST services of Azure Maps or Bing Maps depending on which API key you use in your bot. 
- User location returned as strongly-typed object complying with schema.org.
- Address disambiguation when more than one address is found.
- Support for declaring required location fields.
- Support for FB Messenger's location picker GUI dialog.
- Open-source code (C# and Node.js) with customizable dialog strings. 

## Prerequisites
To start using the control, you need to obtain an Azure Maps or Bing Maps API subscription key. 

* You can sign up to get a free Azure Maps key with up to 25,000 transactions per month through Azure. Details are documented [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-maps/how-to-manage-account-keys).
* You can sign up to get a free Bing Maps key with up to 125,000 transactions per year in the [Bing Maps Portal](https://www.bingmapsportal.com/).

## Getting Started
Navigate to the [C#](/CSharp) or [Node.js](/Node) folder and follow the guide to add the control to your Bot Framework bot. 

## Examples
The examples show different location selection scenarios supported by the Microsoft location control. 

### Address selection with single result returned

![Single Address](Images/skype_singleaddress_2.png)

### Address selection with multiple results returned

![Multiple Addresses](Images/skype_multiaddress_1.png)

### Address selection with required fields filling

![Required Fields](Images/skype_requiredaddress_1.png)

### Address selection using FB Messenger's location picker GUI dialog

354,354,loqix/BottlEye,,"<img src=""./bottleye_logo.png"" width=""500"">

# Overview
BottlEye is a usermode emulator for the commercial anti-cheat [BattlEye](battleye.com) that works by recreating the anti-cheat module and responding to requests sent by the game server. The write-up of this project can be found on our [website](https://secret.club/2020/07/06/bottleye.html)


# How to use

First you need to set up a man-in-the-middle environment that allows you to capture the responses sent by the real BEClient. When those are logged, implement them into BottlEye and compile it. Replace the BEClient_x64.dll module on disk with your BottlEye build and launch the game.

If you are having issues figuring out the ip address and port to monitor with Wireshark (or whatever tool you choose to use), build BottlEye without the responses and launch the game with it. BottlEye will print the ip and port, which you can later use to filter traffic with.

# prometheus_bot

This bot is designed to alert messages from [alertmanager](https://github.com/prometheus/alertmanager).

## Compile

[GOPATH related doc](https://golang.org/doc/code.html#GOPATH).
```bash
export GOPATH=""your go path""
make clean
make
```

## Usage

1. Create Telegram bot with [BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather), it will return your bot token

2. Specify telegram token in ```config.yaml```:

    ```yml
    telegram_token: ""token goes here""
    # ONLY IF YOU USING DATA FORMATTING FUNCTION, NOTE for developer: important or test fail
    time_outdata: ""02/01/2006 15:04:05"" 
    template_path: ""template.tmpl"" # ONLY IF YOU USING TEMPLATE
    time_zone: ""Europe/Rome"" # ONLY IF YOU USING TEMPLATE
    split_msg_byte: 4000
    send_only: true # use bot only to send messages.
    ```

3. Run ```telegram_bot```. See ```prometheus_bot --help``` for command line options
3. Get chat ID with one of two ways
    1. Start conversation, send message to bot mentioning it
    2. Add your bot to a group. It should report group id now. To get ID of a group if bot is already a member [send a message that starts with `/`](https://core.telegram.org/bots#privacy-mode)

### Configuring alert manager

Alert manager configuration file:

```yml
- name: 'admins'
  webhook_configs:
  - send_resolved: True
    url: http://127.0.0.1:9087/alert/chat_id
```

Replace ```chat_id``` with the value you got from your bot, ***with everything inside the quotes***.
(Some chat_id's start with a ```-```, in this case, you must also include the ```-``` in the url)
To use multiple chats just add more receivers.

## Test

To run tests with `make test` you have to:

- Create `config.yml` with a valid telegram API key and timezone in the project directory
- Create `prometheus_bot` executable binary in the project directory
- Define chat ID with `TELEGRAM_CHATID` environment variable
- Ensure port `9087` on localhost is available to bind to

```bash
export TELEGRAM_CHATID=""YOUR TELEGRAM CHAT ID""
make test
```
### Create your own test
When alert manager send alert to telegram bot, *only debug flag ```-d```* Telegram bot will dump json in that generate alert, in stdout.
You can copy paste this from json for your test, by creating new .json.
Test will send ```*.json``` file into ```testdata``` folder

or

```sh
TELEGRAM_CHATID=""YOUR TELEGRAM CHAT ID"" make test
```

## Customising messages with template

This bot support [go templating language](https://golang.org/pkg/text/template/).
Use it for customising your message.

To enable template set these settings in your ```config.yaml``` or template will be skipped.

```yml
telegram_token: ""token here""
template_path: ""template.tmpl"" # your template file name
time_zone: ""Europe/Rome"" # your time zone check it out from WIKI
split_token: ""|"" # token used for split measure label.
disable_notification: true  # disable notification for messages.
```

You can also pass template path with `-t` command line argument, it has higher priority than the config option.

[WIKI List of tz database time zones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones)

Best way for build your custom template is:
-    Enable bot with ```-d``` flag
-    Catch some of your alerts in json, then copy it from bot STDOUT
-    Save json in testdata/yourname.json
-    Launch ```make test```

```-d``` options will enable ```debug``` mode and template file will reload every message, else template is load once on startup.

Is provided as [default template file](testdata/default.tmpl) with all possibile variable.
Remember that telegram bot support HTML tag. Check [telegram doc here](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#html-style) for list of aviable tags.

### Template extra functions
Template language support many different functions for text, number and data formatting.

#### Support this functions list

-   ```str_UpperCase```: Convert string to uppercase
-   ```str_LowerCase```: Convert string to lowercase
-   ```str_Title```: Convert string in Title, ""title"" --> ""Title"" fist letter become Uppercase
-   DEPRECATED  ```str_Format_Byte```: Convert number expressed in ```Byte``` to number in related measure unit. It use ```strconv.ParseFloat(..., 64)``` take look at go related doc for possible input format, usually every think '35.95e+06' is correct converted.
Example:
    -    35'000'000 [Kb] will converter to '35 Gb'
    -    89'000 [Kb] will converter to '89 Mb'
-   ```str_Format_MeasureUnit```: Convert string to scaled number and add append measure unit label. For add measure unit label you could add it in prometheus alerting rule. Example of working: 8*e10 become 80G. You cuold also start from a different scale, example kilo:""s|g|3"". Check production example for complete implementation. Require ```split_token: ""|""``` in conf.yaml
-   ```HasKey```: Param:dict map, key_search string Search in map if there requeted key

-    ```str_FormatDate```: Convert prometheus string date in your preferred date time format, config file param ```time_outdata``` could be used for setup your favourite format
Require more setting in your cofig.yaml
```yaml
time_zone: ""Europe/Rome""
time_outdata: ""02/01/2006 15:04:05""
```

## Production example

Production example contains a example of how could be a real template.

```testdata/production_example.json```
```testdata/production_example.tmpl```

It could be a base, for build a real template, or simply copy some part, check-out how to use functions.
Sysadmin usually love copy.

__Project on hiatus.__ https://dustinblackman.com/posts/2019/05/hiatus-from-open-source/

## About

A fantastic, helpful, and fun [Discord](https://discordapp.com) chat and music bot! Gravebot comes with a bunch of cool and powerful commands for both Discord and games!

## [Changelog](CHANGELOG.md)

## How to use
#### Invitation

Deprecated, see [here](#localconfig) for self hosting.

~~The easiest way to set this bot up on your server is to invite it to your Discord server. It is currently hosted 24/7 and will always get the newest features first.~~

~~In order to do that, just [click here](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?&client_id=170664340968570880&scope=bot&permissions=305261590) and choose a server. You need to have **Manage Server** permission on that server. You may remove some of the permissions if you wish, but be warned it may break current and upcoming features.~~

~~If you want to give the bot a first try, you may do that in the [Gravebot's Lair](https://discord.gg/0iXEgtjdHgkpdsVr) Discord server.~~

~~If you have any questions, feedback, or want to request features, you may also do that by leaving a message in [Gravebot's Lair](https://discord.gg/0iXEgtjdHgkpdsVr), using the `!feedback` command, private messaging Gravestorm or Zalik, as well as opening an [issue on Github](https://github.com/Gravebot/Gravebot/issues/new).~~

## Local Installation
#### Windows:
**Warning**: Windows may have issues, even if all steps are done, sadly, we are not able to find the right dependencies for it (mostly regarding League of Legends and Wolfram commands), if you are familiar with coding, you can try messing around, either finding the right dependencies, or disabling the commands. If you are not familiar with coding, I would advise you to try out Linux, just install it alongside Windows and give it like 20GB of space, it will be plenty and you will have a good experience. Feel free to ask for help regarding installation in Gravebot's Lair, just keep this in mind.

- Install [Node.js v4.8.3](https://nodejs.org/en)
- Install [Python v2.7.13](https://www.python.org/downloads)
- Install [Microsoft Visual Studio C++ Express](http://go.microsoft.com/?linkid=9816758)

# How to use 如何使用

###导入项目

##### Gradle  
      compile 'com.github.kingideayou:SlideBottomPanel:1.0.6'
##### Import  

首先下载 SlideBottomPanel，将 SlideBottomPanel 文件夹拷贝到项目的目录下面，然后在setting.gradle文件中增加文件夹名称

      include "":SlideBottomPanel""

然后在我们需要依赖这个模块的module中的build.gradle文件中加入如下代码:
    
      compile project(':SlideBottomPanel')

### 布局文件      
导入成功后，只需要在 XML 文件中添加如下视图（层级比较简单 FrameLayout 的子视图直接包含 ListView 或者 ScrollView）  
下面布局只作简单演示，复杂效果请看 Demo.

      <!-- sbp_hide_panel_title 为滑动过程中及子视图显示是是否需要隐藏标题，默认显示（目前只支持 FrameLayout） -->
      <!-- background_layout 为首页显示在滑块底部的视图（下面的示例图中的 WebView） -->
      <me.next.slidebottompanel.SlideBottomPanel
        android:id=""@+id/sbv""
        android:layout_width=""match_parent""
        android:layout_height=""match_parent""
        app:sbp_title_height_no_display=""55dp""
        app:sbp_panel_height=""380dp""
        app:sbp_hide_panel_title=""true""
        app:sbp_background_layout=""@layout/background_layout"">


        <FrameLayout
            android:layout_width=""match_parent""
            android:layout_height=""380dp""
            android:background=""#ffffff""
            android:orientation=""vertical"">

            <ListView
                android:id=""@+id/list_view""
                android:layout_width=""match_parent""
                android:layout_height=""match_parent""/>
                
            <!-- 标题，如果需要完整显示标题，设置 sbp_title_height_no_display=""标题的高度"" -->
            <TextView
                android:layout_width=""match_parent""
                android:layout_height=""55dp""
                text=""我是标题""
                android:orientation=""horizontal""
                android:gravity=""center_vertical""
                android:paddingLeft=""@dimen/activity_horizontal_margin""
                android:paddingRight=""@dimen/activity_horizontal_margin""
                android:background=""#ffffff""/>

        </FrameLayout>

    </me.next.slidebottompanel.SlideBottomPanel>
    
同时也支持复杂一点的效果（知乎日报β版），子视图 FrameLayout 中包含 ViewGroup，ViewGroup 包含 ListView 或 ScrollView
    
    <me.next.slidebottompanel.SlideBottomPanel
        android:id=""@+id/sbv""
        android:layout_width=""match_parent""
        android:layout_height=""match_parent""
        app:sbp_hide_panel_title=""true""
        app:sbp_title_height_no_display=""55dp""
        app:sbp_panel_height=""380dp""
        app:sbp_background_layout=""@layout/background_layout"">
      
      
        <FrameLayout
            android:layout_width=""match_parent""
            android:layout_height=""380dp""
            android:background=""#ffffff""
            android:orientation=""vertical"">

            <LinearLayout
                android:weightSum=""9""
                android:layout_width=""match_parent""
                android:layout_height=""match_parent""
                android:orientation=""vertical"">
                
                <ListView
                    android:id=""@+id/list_view""
                    android:layout_width=""match_parent""
                    android:layout_height=""match_parent""
                    android:layout_weight=""8""/>
                
                <TextView
                    android:id=""@+id/tv_edit""
                    android:layout_weight=""1""
                    android:layout_width=""match_parent""
                    android:layout_height=""0dp""
                    android:layout_gravity=""center_vertical""
                    android:gravity=""center_vertical""
                    android:layout_marginLeft=""@dimen/activity_horizontal_margin""
                    android:text=""写点评...""/>

            </LinearLayout>
        </FrameLayout>
        
        <TextView
            android:layout_width=""match_parent""
            android:layout_height=""55dp""
            text=""我是标题""
            android:orientation=""horizontal""
            android:gravity=""center_vertical""
            android:paddingLeft=""@dimen/activity_horizontal_margin""
            android:paddingRight=""@dimen/activity_horizontal_margin""
            android:background=""#ffffff""/>

    </me.next.slidebottompanel.SlideBottomPanel>
  
### 代码控制  
完成布局文件后，在 Activity 中将对应的视图填充即可。

      //隐藏 SlideBottomPanel
        if (sbv.isPanelShowing()) {
            sbv.hide();
        }


      //显示 SlideBottomPanel
      sbv.displayPanel()

# 全流程（bot速用教学）
```text
1.请在先关注频道 https://t.me/agentONE_R 和机器人 https://t.me/radiance_helper_bot

2.使用客户端一键部署命令

3.机器人使用/raninfo命令生成随机信息，然后将它放入你客户端的client_config配置文件内，同时将甲骨文云API配置(获取方式查看额外说明2)放入配置文件内

4.你的客户端服务器需未占用并且放行9527（或全部）端口，然后使用bash sh_client_bot.sh的启动客户端服务器。结束！可以使用bot了！

```

### 以下为客户端服务器配置流程

#### 1.Linux一键部署/更新（运行完后使用bash sh_java_oci.sh可再次运行）
```bash
wget -O gz_client_bot.tar.gz  https://github.com/semicons/java_oci_manage/releases/download/latest/gz_client_bot.tar.gz && tar -zxvf gz_client_bot.tar.gz --exclude=client_config  && tar -zxvf gz_client_bot.tar.gz --skip-old-files client_config && chmod +x sh_client_bot.sh && bash sh_client_bot.sh
```
#### 2. 参考配置文件参数(支持多个)
- 编辑client_config文件
```text

#在oci=begin和oci=end之间放入你的API配置信息 支持多个配置文件(注意[]内不支持中文) 机器人切换profile可更换操作配置
oci=begin

[DEFAULT]
user=ocid1.user.oc1..aaaaaaaaxxxxgwlg3xuzwgsaazxtzbozqq
fingerprint=b8:33:6f:xxxx:45:43:33
tenancy=ocid1.tenancy.oc1..aaaaaaaaxxx7x7h4ya
region=ap-singapore-1
key_file=写你的API密钥文件路径

[DEFAULT2]
user=ocid1.user.oc1..aaaaaaaaxxxxgwlg3xuzwgsaazxtzbozqq
fingerprint=b8:33:6f:xxxx:45:43:33
tenancy=ocid1.tenancy.oc1..aaaaaaaaxxx7x7h4ya
region=ap-singapore-1
key_file=写你的API密钥文件路径

oci=end

#用户信息 从 https://t.me/radiance_helper_bot 配置(bot可使用/raninfo命令随机生成)
#必传
username=
#必传
password=

#cloudflare 功能参数 非必传
#非必传 cloudflare邮箱
cf_email=
#非必传 cloudflare key 在我的个人资料->API令牌处->API密钥->Global API Key	获取
cf_account_key=

#非必填 本机ip和端口号 (进阶玩家选项 可填写域名) 不写将自动获取本机ip 并使用默认端口号9527 (小白用户建议不填) 如填写 格式为:http://xxx.xx:9527
local_address=
#非必填 url名称(默认为address 可在bot上修改)
local_url_name=
```

#### 3. 使用说明
```text
如何运行？
请先在配置文件内输入对应的参数，然后运行下方需要的指令(需要开启默认9527端口)

bash sh_client_bot.sh （启动）

tail -f log_r_client.log  (实时查看日志,ctrl + c退出日志)

ps -ef | grep r_client.jar | grep -v grep | awk '{print $2}' | xargs kill -9 (终止进程)

脚本支持传参 bash sh_client_bot.sh 9999  更换默认9527端口到9999端口 同时需填写local_address

使用查看日志命令查看日志 显示 服务已启动成功... 代表客户端已成功启动 可以使用bot进行你需要的操作了


参数如何设置？
请在client_config文件 oci=begin  oci=end 中间放入oracle API参数

username 和 password对应填写 

cf功能按需填写 
address进阶用户填写
```



##### 额外说明 1.文件说明
```text
│  sh_client_bot.sh       # 脚本文件 跟以下文件在同一个目录
│  r_client.jar   # 程序主文件 需要跟 脚本文件在同一个目录
   client_config  #配置文件 需跟主程序在同一目录
```
##### 额外说明 2.甲骨文后台获取API参数
```
- 【操作导航，任意一种均可】
- 1.甲骨文后台=>用户设置>>资源>>API秘钥>>添加API秘钥->(在指纹右侧三个点处查看参数)

- 2.如没有用户设置的请直接搜用户(切中文语言) 点击选择某个用户名 API秘钥>>添加API秘钥->(在指纹右侧三个点处查看参数)

- 3.不会搜的点击左边菜单一栏 找到身份和安全=>用户=>点击选择某个用户名=>API秘钥>>添加API秘钥）->(在指纹右侧三个点处查看参数)
- 说明∶此处配置是连接甲骨文云接口的所必须参数(还不会建议不玩甲骨文)
```text
大致如下↓

[DEFAULT]
user=ocid1.user.oc1..aaaaaaaaxxxxgwlg3xuzwgsaazxtzbozqq
fingerprint=b8:33:6f:xxxx:45:43:33
tenancy=ocid1.tenancy.oc1..aaaaaaaaxxx7x7h4ya
region=ap-singapore-1
key_file=写你的密钥文件路径
```
- 将在甲骨文用户设置添加api密钥的配置文件预览里面的参数 放入到client_config配置文件内(请注意 key_file的私钥位置要正确，【私钥文件】在你添加api的时候生成下载的，然后放入你想放的位置，如：key_file=/root/oci/oci_api_key.pem)

Market Bot is a web scraper (web robot, web spider) for the Google Play Android app store.
It can collect data on apps, charts, and developers.

**Google has recently changed the HTML and CSS for the Play Store.
This has caused the release version of Market Bot to break.
New code is in the master branch (unreleased) to begin fixing this problem.
If you are interesed in helping then please join the discussion in [issue 72](https://github.com/chadrem/market_bot/issues/72).**

## Dependencies

* Ruby MRI 2.1.X or newer
* Nokogiri gem
* Typhoeus gem

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile to use the latest stable version:

    gem 'market_bot'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

## App API example

    # Download/parse the app.
    app = MarketBot::Play::App.new('com.facebook.katana')
    app.update

    # Print out the app title.
    puts app.title

    # Print all the other attributes you can find on an app object.
    puts MarketBot::Play::App::ATTRIBUTES.inspect

## Charts API example

Charts are defined by a collection and an option category.

    # Download/parse the chart (collection=topselling_free, category=GAME).
    chart = MarketBot::Play::Chart.new('topselling_free', 'GAME')
    chart.update

    # Print the first app.
    puts chart.result.first.inspect

    # Print all the chart collections & categories.
    puts MarketBot::Play::Chart::COLLECTIONS.inspect
    puts MarketBot::Play::Chart::CATEGORIES.inspect

## Developer API example

    # Download/parse developer.
    dev = MarketBot::Play::Developer.new('Zynga')
    dev.update

    # Print the first app.
    puts dev.result.first.inspect

## Language and Country support

Market Bot defaults to USA and English.
You can specify a country and a language to override the defaults when creating objects:

    chart = MarketBot::Play::Chart.new('topselling_paid', 'BUSINESS', country: 'jp', lang: 'ja')
    chart.update

    app = MarketBot::Play::App.new('com.facebook.katana', country: 'jp', lang: 'ja')
    app.update

## Excessive Use

Google will block your IP address if you attempt to scrape large quantities of data.

## Contributing to Market Bot

1. Check out the latest master to make sure the feature hasn't been implemented or the bug hasn't been fixed yet.
2. Check out the issue tracker to make sure someone already hasn't requested it and/or contributed it.
3. Fork the project.
4. Start a feature/bugfix branch.
5. Commit and push until you are happy with your contribution.
6. Make sure to add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
7. Please try not to mess with the Rakefile, version, or history. If you want to have your own version, or is otherwise necessary, that is fine, but please isolate to its own commit so I can cherry-pick around it.

## Bot is working, MobBot Redux Version in Development
The latest Version is compatible with PoGo 0.33. Keep in mind that many of the API calls made by us ( and every other open source Bot out there ) are wrong. They will most likely flag you and get you banned.<br>
Thats why we started to work on a new Bot some while ago. MobBot Redux will feature a fully modular architecture, Plugins API and a totally redone API that focuses on emulating the client. More Informations & Updates on this on [our Twitter Page](https://twitter.com/PokeMobBot).

[<img src=""screenshots/features-2.png""/>](screenshots/raw/features-2.png)

## 実装されている機能

- [便利なHTTPスニファ](#アプリのネットワークトラフィックを記録)
- [実装されるアクティビティはいつでも３D化できます](#アクティビティを3D化する)
- [SharedPreferencesをランタイム時に簡単的に編集できます](#SharedPreferencesを編集する)
- [ランタイム時にStrictモードをオン・オブにするのを可能とさせてます](#Strictモードで開発)
- [アプリがクラッシュするとログが保存されます](#クラッシュログ)
- [早くメモリリークを発見できて、そして回避できます](#leak-canaryを使用する)
- [UIスレッドのフリーズを起こすコードを見つけます](#uiフリーズを排除する)
- [いずれのアクティビティを簡単にアクセスできます](#アクティビティをいつでも起動する)

#### アプリのネットワークトラフィックを記録
この機能は、デバッグボットルがHTTPリクエストとリスポンスをログファイルに書き込む。記録されたログファイルはいつでも見えます。

[<img src=""screenshots/network-sniffer-1.png""/>](screenshots/raw/network-sniffer-1.png)
[<img src=""screenshots/network-sniffer-2.png""/>](screenshots/raw/network-sniffer-2.png)

#### アクティビティを3D化する
View のデバッグ用途として、画面をグリグリすると 3DCG みたいに View のヒエラルキーを見ることができるようになるツールです。

[<img src=""screenshots/scalpel-view.png""/>](screenshots/raw/network-sniffer-2.png)
[<img src=""screenshots/scalpel-view.gif"" width=""225"" height=""400"" />](screenshots/raw/scalpel-view.gif)

#### SharedPreferencesを編集する
アプリが使ってるすべてのSharedPreferencesをランタイム時に編集する。

[<img src=""screenshots/shared-preferences-editor-1.png""/>](screenshots/raw/network-sniffer-2.png)
[<img src=""screenshots/shared-preferences-editor-2.png""/>](screenshots/raw/network-sniffer-2.png)

#### Strictモードで開発
StrictModeはアプリケーションの動作をもっさりさせる原因となる、 ディスクやネットワークへのアクセスを検知するための仕組みです。使う方とかを[オフィシャルサイト](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/StrictMode.html)で見えます。

#### クラッシュログ
アプリがクラッシュするとログが保存され、デバッグボトルからログを取得して解析することができます。

[<img src=""screenshots/crash.gif"" width=""225"" height=""400"">](screenshots/raw/crash.gif)

#### Leak Canaryを使用する
Squareのメモリリークを検出するライブラリ Leak Canary を通じて、メモリリークを調査できます。デバッグボトルはすでにLeak Canaryを含んでいるから、その機能は使えます。もっと詳しくは[こちらで](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/wiki/FAQ)。

#### UIフリーズを排除する
一旦UIフリーズが発生となると、デバッグボトルはノティファイで通知して、同じ時にログファイルを作成します。開発者はログファイルで、フリーズの原因を知り、排除するのは可能となります。

[<img src=""screenshots/ui-blocks.png""/>](screenshots/raw/network-sniffer-2.png)
[<img src=""screenshots/block-canary-demo.gif"" width=""225"" height=""400"" />](screenshots/raw/block-canary-demo.gif)

#### アクティビティをいつでも起動する
デバッグボトルはシンプルなエントリーを提供し、アクティビティやRunnableはそのエントリーを通じて起動できます。エントリーは３つあります：
* すべてのアクティビティエントリー
* カストマイズインテントエントリー
* カストマイズRunnableエントリー

[<img src=""screenshots/run-activity-with-intent.gif"" width=""225"" height=""400"" />](screenshots/raw/run-activity-with-intent.gif)

## 構築するには

#### 1. Gradleプロジェクトファイルを構成する
まずはスナップショットリポジトリを配置します。
```gradle
allprojects {
    repositories {
        ...
        mavenCentral()
    }
}
```
アプリのプライマリモジュールによるGradleファイルに依頼環境を導入します。

```gradle
dependencies {
    debugCompile 'com.exyui.android:debug-bottle-runtime:1.1.1'

    // Javaの場合はこうして構築します
    releaseCompile 'com.exyui.android:debug-bottle-noop-java:1.1.1'
    testCompile 'com.exyui.android:debug-bottle-noop-java:1.1.1'

    // Kotlinの場合はこうして構築します
    releaseCompile 'com.exyui.android:debug-bottle-noop-kotlin:1.1.1'
    testCompile 'com.exyui.android:debug-bottle-noop-kotlin:1.1.1'

    compile 'com.android.support:appcompat-v7:23.2.0+'
}
```

Specially, Debug Bottle not only support API 23+, but also 22. To support API 22, please add dependencies like this:
```gradle
dependencies {
    debugCompile 'com.exyui.android:debug-bottle-runtime:1.0.6-support22'

    // Javaの場合はこうして構築します
    releaseCompile 'com.exyui.android:debug-bottle-noop-java:1.0.6-support22'
    testCompile 'com.exyui.android:debug-bottle-noop-java:1.0.6-support22'

    // Kotlinの場合はこうして構築します
    releaseCompile 'com.exyui.android:debug-bottle-noop-kotlin:1.0.6-support22'
    testCompile 'com.exyui.android:debug-bottle-noop-kotlin:1.0.6-support22'

    compile 'com.android.support:appcompat-v7:22+'
}
```

To support API 23, add dependencies like this:
```gradle
dependencies {
    debugCompile 'com.exyui.android:debug-bottle-runtime:1.0.6-support23'

    // Javaの場合はこうして構築します
    releaseCompile 'com.exyui.android:debug-bottle-noop-java:1.0.6-support23'
    testCompile 'com.exyui.android:debug-bottle-noop-java:1.0.6-support23'

    // Kotlinの場合はこうして構築します
    releaseCompile 'com.exyui.android:debug-bottle-noop-kotlin:1.0.6-support23'
    testCompile 'com.exyui.android:debug-bottle-noop-kotlin:1.0.6-support23'

    compile 'com.android.support:appcompat-v7:23+'
}
```

#### 2. Manifestに加入
Manifestにデバッグボトルのプライマリアクティビティを加入します。
```xml
<activity
    android:name=""com.exyui.android.debugbottle.components.DTDrawerActivity""
    android:theme=""@style/Theme.AppCompat.Light""
    android:label=""ほげほげツール""/>
```
「ほげほげツール」はこのツールの名前、欲しいネームを付けてよろしい、ただし空きでは行けません。

#### 3. Applicationにデバッグボトルを注入
まずは「BlockCanaryContext」を実装します。
```java
public class AppBlockCanaryContext extends BlockCanaryContext {...}
```

そしてデバッグボトルをApplicationに注入します。
```java
public class MyApplication extends Application{
    @Override
    public void onCreate() {
        super.onCreate();
        DTInstaller.install(this)
            .setBlockCanary(new AppBlockCanaryContext(this))
            .setOkHttpClient(httpClient)
            .setInjector(""your.package.injector.ContentInjector"")
            .setPackageName(""your.package"")
            .enable()
            .run();
    }
}
```
Kotlinを使ってる場合は、以下の方法で注入します。
```kotlin
class MyApplication: Application() {
    override fun onCreate() {
        super.onCreate()
        DTInstaller.install(this)
            .setBlockCanary(AppBlockCanaryContext(this))
            .setOkHttpClient(httpClient)
            .setInjector(""your.package.injector.ContentInjector"")
            .setPackageName(""your.package"")
            .enable()
            .run()
    }
}
```

369,369,microsoft/BotBuilder-Azure,C#,"# V3 Deprecation Notification

Microsoft Bot Framework SDK V4 was released in September 2018, and since then we have shipped a few dot-release improvements. As announced previously, the V3  SDK is being retired with final long-term support ending on December 31st, 2019.
Accordingly, there will be no more development in this repo. **Existing V3 bot workloads will continue to run without interruption. We have no plans to disrupt any running workloads**.

We highly recommend that you start migrating your V3 bots to V4. In order to support this migration we have produced migration documentation and will provide extended support for migration initiatives (via standard channels such as Stack Overflow and Microsoft Customer Support).

For more information please refer to the following references:
* Migration Documentation: https://aka.ms/v3v4-bot-migration
* End of lifetime support announcement: https://aka.ms/bfmigfaq
* Primary V4 Repositories to develop Bot Framework bots
  * [Botbuilder for dotnet](https://github.com/microsoft/botbuilder-dotnet)
  * [Botbuilder for JS](https://github.com/microsoft/botbuilder-js)

  * [Libraries for dotnet](https://github.com/Microsoft/botbuilder-dotnet/tree/master/libraries/Microsoft.Bot.Builder.AI.QnA)
  * [Libraries for JS](https://github.com/Microsoft/botbuilder-js/blob/master/libraries/botbuilder-ai/src/qnaMaker.ts)
* Azure Libraries were replaced with the following V4 libraries:
  * [Botbuilder for JS Azure](https://github.com/Microsoft/botbuilder-js/tree/master/libraries/botbuilder-azure)
  * [Botbuilder for dotnet Azure](https://github.com/Microsoft/botbuilder-dotnet/tree/master/libraries/Microsoft.Bot.Builder.Azure)


# Bot Builder SDK Azure Extensions

The Microsoft Bot Builder SDK Azure Extensions allow for interactions with specific Azure components.

## Bot Builder SDK

For More information about the Bot Builder SDK, which is one of the three main components of the Microsoft Bot Framework, please **[Review the documentation](http://docs.botframework.com)**.

The Microsoft Bot Framework provides just what you need to build and connect intelligent bots that interact naturally wherever your users are talking, from text/sms to Skype, Slack, Office 365 mail and other popular services.

Bots (or conversation agents) are rapidly becoming an integral part of one’s digital experience – they are as vital a way for users to interact with a service or application as is a web site or a mobile experience. Developers writing bots all face the same problems: bots require basic I/O; they must have language and dialog skills; and they must connect to users – preferably in any conversation experience and language the user chooses. The Bot Framework provides tools to easily solve these problems and more for developers e.g., automatic translation to more than 30 languages, user and conversation state management, debugging tools, an embeddable web chat control and a way for users to discover, try, and add bots to the conversation experiences they love.

## Azure Extensions

### Bot Azure Storage

The Bot Builder SDK Azure Extensions enable bot developers to integrate bots with specific Azure components. 

* Azure Table Storage: Allows bot developers to store bot state in their own Azure Storage accounts. For more information on Azure Table Storage, visit the **[Azure Table Storage 
Documentation](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/storage/tables/)**
* Azure CosmosDB: Allows bot developers to store bot state in CosmosDB. For more information on Azure CosmosDb, visit the **[Azure CosmosDB Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/introduction)**

### Azure Table Logging

The Bot Builder SDK Azure Extensions also include [TableLogger](CSharp/Library/Microsoft.Bot.Builder.Azure/TableLogger.cs), an implementation of IActivityLogger which will log activities to the specified Azure Table.

## Azure Extensions Samples

Get started quickly with our samples:

* Azure Table [C#](CSharp/Samples/AzureTable) [Node.js](Node/examples/feature-azureTable)
* CosmosDb [C#](CSharp/Samples/DocumentDb) [Node.js](Node/examples/feature-documentDb)

See all the support options **[here](https://docs.botframework.com/en-us/support/)**.

README

  Please, at least SKIM this document before asking questions. In fact,
  READ IT if you've never successfully set up an Eggdrop bot before.

NOTICE

  Make SURE that you select your +n (owner) users wisely. They have 100%
  access to your bot and account. ONLY GIVE THIS POWER TO SOMEONE YOU
  TRUST COMPLETELY!

WHAT IS EGGDROP?

  Eggdrop is the world's most popular Internet Relay Chat (IRC) bot; it
  is freely distributable under the GNU General Public License (GPL).
  Eggdrop is a feature-rich program designed to be easily used and
  expanded upon by both novice and advanced IRC users on a variety of
  hardware and software platforms.

  An IRC bot is a program that sits on an IRC channel and performs
  automated tasks while looking just like a normal user on the channel.
  Some of these functions include protecting the channel from abuse,
  allowing privileged users to gain op or voice status, logging channel
  events, providing information, hosting games, etc.

  One of the features that makes Eggdrop stand out from other bots is
  module and Tcl scripting support. With scripts and modules you can
  make the bot perform almost any task you want. They can do anything:
  from preventing floods to greeting users and banning advertisers from
  channels.

  You can also link multiple Eggdrop bots together to form a botnet.
  This can allow bots to op each other securely, control floods
  efficiently and even link channels across multiple IRC networks. It
  also allows the Eggdrops share user lists, ban/exempt/invite lists,
  and ignore lists with other bots if userfile sharing is enabled. This
  allows users to have the same access on every bot on your botnet. It
  also allows the bots to distribute tasks such as opping and banning
  users. See doc/BOTNET for information on setting up a botnet.

  Eggdrop is always being improved and adjusted because there are bugs
  to be fixed and features to be added (if the users demand them and
  they make actually sense). In fact, it existed for several years as
  v0.7 - v0.9 before finally going 1.0. This version of Eggdrop is part
  of the 1.9 tree. A valiant effort has been made to chase down and
  destroy bugs.

  This README file contains information about how to get Eggdrop,
  command line options for Eggdrop, what you may need to do when
  upgrading from older versions, a list of frequently asked questions,
  how to set up a crontab, some boring legal stuff, some basics about
  git usage and some channels where you might get help with Eggdrop.

HOW TO GET EGGDROP

  Before you can compile Eggdrop, you need to have Tcl installed on your
  system. Most systems should have Tcl on them by now - you can check by
  trying the command ""tclsh"". If it works, you will be given a ""%""
  prompt and you can type ""exit"" to exit the program. This means Tcl is
  installed on your system. If tclsh doesn't load, then Tcl probably
  isn't on your system, and you will need to install it. The website to
  download Tcl is https://www.tcl.tk/software/tcltk/download.html and
  most OS distros have a binary installation available. If installing
  via an OS package manager, make sure to install the development
  library as well, usually called something similar to 'tcl-dev'.

  Currently, the 1.9 tree of Eggdrop is developed at eggheads.org. You
  can get the latest STABLE version of Eggdrop from the following url:

    https://geteggdrop.com/

  You might try www.eggheads.org for help and information.

GIT USAGE

  Eggdrop development has moved from a CVS-based version control system
  to git. If you are interested in trying out the VERY LATEST updates to
  Eggdrop, you may be interested in pulling the most recent code from
  there. BE WARNED, the development branch of Eggdrop is not to be
  considered stable and may (haha) have some significant bugs in it. The
  Eggheads Development Team will in NO WAY take any responsibility for
  whatever might happen to you or your shell if you use the development
  branch of Eggdrop!

  To obtain Eggdrop via the git repository (hosted by GitHub), you can
  either clone the repository via git or download a development
  snapshot.

  To clone the repository, simply type:

      git clone https://github.com/eggheads/eggdrop.git 

  Otherwise, you can download the development snapshot as a tar archive
  from:

    https://github.com/eggheads/eggdrop/archive/develop.tar.gz

QUICK STARTUP

  Please, see the INSTALL file after you finish reading this file.

UPGRADING

UPGRADING FROM AN OLDER 1.3/1.4/1.5/1.6/1.8 TO A 1.9 VERSION

  If you followed the INSTALL file and did a 'make install' (or 'make
  install DEST=""path""') after 'make', this will be pretty easy. Just
  upload the new eggdrop-1.9.x.tar.gz file to your home dir on your
  shell, gunzip and untar it, and type 'cd ~/eggdrop-1.9.x'. Next, type
  './configure', 'make config' or 'make iconfig', then 'make'. Then,
  kill the bot ('.die' on the partyline) and 'make install' to the same
  directory your bot is currently in. After that, you can just restart
  your bot. You may wish to delete the old Eggdrop executable and
  modules as well, especially if you have limited disk space.

  You should read through the new eggdrop.conf file for all of the new
  options in Eggdrop 1.9.x. You can copy and paste any of these settings
  into you current conf file if you do not want to use the default
  settings.

COMMAND LINE

  Eggdrop has some command line options - not many, because most things
  should be defined through the config file. However, sometimes you may
  want to start up the bot in a different mode and the command line
  options let you do that. Basically, the command line for Eggdrop is:

      % eggdrop [options] [config-file]

  The options available are:

    -t: Don't background, use terminal. Your console will dropp into an

        interactive partyline session, simialar to a DCC chat with the
        bot. This is useful for troubleshooting connection issues with
        the bot.

    -c: Don't background, show channel info. Every 10 seconds your screen

        will clear and you will see the current channel status, sort of
        like ""top"".

    -m: Create userfile. If you don't have a userfile, this will make Eggdrop

        create one and give owner status to the first person that
        introduces himself or herself to it. You'll need to do this when
        you first set up your bot.

    -h: Show help, then quit.

    -v: Show version info, then quit.

  Most people never use any of the options except -m and you usually
  only need to use that once.

SETTING UP A CRONTAB

  Eggdrop has become more stable with time, thanks mostly to people
  reporting bug details and helping find places where it crashes.
  However, there are still a -few- places where things aren't perfect.
  Few, if any, things in life are.

  Also, most systems go down from time to time. These things cause your
  bot to disappear from IRC and you have to restart it.

  Eggdrop comes with a shell script as scripts/botchk that will help
  keep the bot online. It will make the machine check every ten minutes
  to make sure your bot is still running. To use it, you have to add a
  line to your crontab. First, edit 'botchk' and change the directory
  and command line parameters so that it will be able to start up your
  bot. Then, add this line to your crontab:

      0,10,20,30,40,50 * * * * /home/mydir/botchk

  If you don't want to get emails from cron, use this:

      0,10,20,30,40,50 * * * * /home/mydir/botchk >/dev/null 2>&1

  Naturally, you need to change the path to the correct path for botchk.
  If you've never used crontab before, here is a simple way to add that
  line:

    1.  Create a new file called 'mycron' and put the above line into
        it;
    2.  From your shell prompt, type '% crontab mycron'.

  That will create a new crontab entry for you with a line that runs
  botchk every ten minutes. Botchk will then restart the bot when
  necessary (and send you email informing you).

SETTING UP A CRONTAB USING AUTOBOTCHK

  Included with your Eggdrop is an Eggdrop utility called 'autobotchk'.
  Using autobotchk is probably the fastest way of creating your botchk
  and crontabbing it with just a few required steps:

    1.:

        cp scripts/autobotchk ..;

    2.:

        ./autobotchk <Eggdrop config file>

  This will hopefully crontab your bot using the default setup. If you
  want a list of autobotchk options, type './autobotchk'. An example
  with options would be:

      ./autobotchk <Eggdrop config file> -noemail -5

  This would setup crontab to run the botchk every 5 minutes and also to
  not send you email saying that it restarted your bot.

BORING LEGAL STUFF

  The Eggdrop bot is Copyright (C) by Robey Pointer. As of January 1997,
  Eggdrop is distributed according to the GNU General Public License.
  There should be a copy of this license in the COPYING file. If not,
  write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth
  Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301, USA.

  As of Eggdrop 1.3.28, all changes made by the Eggheads Development
  Team to the Eggdrop source code and any related files are Copyright
  (C) by Eggheads Development Team. The source code will still be
  distributed according to the GNU General Public License as Robey
  Pointer did in the past.

  Releases previous to 1.0m were made using a different licensing
  scheme. You may, at your option, use the GNU General Public License on
  those versions (instead of the license packaged with them) with my
  blessing. For any versions bearing a copyright date of 1997 or later,
  you have no choice - you must use the GNU General Public License.

  The files match.c, net.c and blowfish.c are exempt from the above
  restrictions. match.c is original code by Chris Fuller (email:
  crf@cfox.bchs.uh.edu) and has been placed by him into the public
  domain. net.c is by me, and I (Robey Pointer) also choose to place it
  in the public domain. blowfish.c is by various sources and is in the
  public domain as well. All 3 files contain useful functions that could
  easily be ported to other applications.

  Tcl is by John Ousterhout and is in no way affiliated with Eggdrop. It
  likely has its own set of copyrights and what-nots.

  There is no warranty, implied or whatever. You use this software at
  your own risk, no matter what purpose you put it to.

MAILING LIST

  There are currently a couple of mailing lists about Eggdrop.
  eggheads@eggheads.org is the one relevant for posts about Eggdrop 1.9
  and up (suggestions, help, etc).

  To subscribe to the eggheads mailing list, send email to
  eggheads-request@eggheads.org. In the body of the message, put
  ""subscribe eggheads"". We commonly use this list to announce new
  releases.You can also go to the following url:

    http://lists.eggheads.org/mailman/listinfo/eggheads

  DO NOT SEND ROBEY EMAIL ABOUT EGGDROP!

  Robey is no longer developing the Eggdrop code, so don't bother
  emailing him. If you have a serious problem, email the eggheads
  mailing list and it will get to the coders.

  Please, before posting to this list, see what things are like. When
  you do post, read over your post for readability, spelling and grammar
  mistakes. Obviously, we're all human (or are we?) and we all make
  mistakes (heck, look at this document! ;).

  Open discussion and debate is integral to change and progress. Don't
  flame others over mere form (grammar and spelling) or even substantive
  issues for that matter. Please read and follow the mailing list rules.

  The eggheads@eggheads.org mailing list is not dedicated to those all
  too common questions we have all seen on other lists. For example:

    -   Why does my bot say this: Please edit your config file.
    -   How do I telnet my bot?
    -   Where do I get Eggdrop for windows??????

  Technical questions, your thoughts or suggestions on new features
  being added to Eggdrop, things that should be removed or fixed,
  amazing problems that even stump the gurus, etc. are what we want to
  see here.

  Bug reports should be generated in the issue section of
  https://www.github.com/eggheads/eggdrop

  DO NOT SEND HTML EMAILS TO ANY OF THE EGGHEADS.ORG MAILING LISTS.
  ANYONE SENDING HTML EMAILS TO ONE OF THESE LISTS WILL BE REMOVED
  IMMEDIATELY!

DOCUMENTATION

  We're trying to keep the documentation up to date. If you feel that
  anything is missing here or that anything should be added, etc, please
  create an issue, or better yet a pull request, at
  https://www.github.com/eggheads/eggdrop Thank you!

- Using type `REPORT` the entire `commend` section is ignored
- Using `auto` in `serverID` or `matchID` will **require** an account to be entered in the `fetcher` section
- Using method `LOGIN` ignored the entire `report`, `fetcher`, `serverID`, and `matchID` section but will **require** you to enter an account in the `account` section, other way around for using the `SERVER` method

# Database Manager

- `Export account list`: Export all accounts in a `username:password` format
- `List commends for user`: List **all** accounts which have commended a specific user
- `Reset commends for user`: Delete **all** commend entries from the database of a specific user (*Note: This does **not** remove commends from the target in-game. You will likely **never** have to use this*)
- `Remove account from database`: Delete a specific account from the database including commend history **\***
- `Add account(s) to database`: Add accounts to the database, import from JSON file, import from `username:password` file or manually add accounts
- `List not working accounts`: List **all** accounts which are marked as inoperational by the script
- `Remove all not working accounts`: Remove **all** accounts which have been marked as not working **\***
- `Get last commend target and time`: Retrieve the last target and time at which we commended
- `Reset Database`: Will clear out **all** content of the database, resetting it to the default
- `Exit`: Safely close database before exiting process

Simply run it via `node databaseManager.js`, use the arrow keys & enter to navigate. Read on-screen instructions for more details.

**\*** Commend history is **important**, removing it will cause the script to re-use already used accounts which will result in duplicate commends, which does not work and will therefore do nothing until commend history has been rebuilt.

# Botting Type

You can choose between two types, `COMMEND` and `REPORT`.

There isn't much to it. Commending botting is confirmed to work, report botting **is impossible to prove working** due to many factors which cannot be controlled. I believe report bots haven't worked since 2016 due to how simple it is to prevent them working. Don't try to lecture me, I don't care.

# Botting Method

You can choose between two botting methods, `LOGIN` and `SERVER`.

- `LOGIN` will log into the targets account and automatically grab a server. Fastest, easiest and most lightweight (No need to run CSGO) for personal usage
  - Note: Do **not** have CSGO open while using this method
- `SERVER` will commend a target, but the target **has** to be on a valid Valve or Community server - [Read More](#server-id-&-match-id)
  - Note: You **cannot** bot someone without them being on a server

# Server ID & Match ID

- The `serverID` field allows for either ServerIP, ServerID or `auto`.
  - Server IP is self explanatory
  - ServerID can be found by entering `status` into the console ingame.
    - On a community server it will look like this: `1.37.0.1/13701 934/7508 secure  [A:1:1297634312:12708]` > `[A:1:1297634312:12708]`.
    - On a Valve server it will look like this: `Connected to =[A:1:3849827331:12657]:0` > `[A:1:3849827331:12657]`.
    - *Make sure to **only** include the stuff between the brackets and the brackets themselves.*
  - `auto` will work on any server, community server **require** the target to use `cl_join_advertise` to be `2` or higher
    - **Requires** an account filled in the `fetcher` section
    - Certain privacy settings may interfer with this, before reporting an issue make sure everything is set to public in your [Steam Privacy Settings](https://steamcommunity.com/my/edit/settings)
- The `matchID` field allows for either MatchID or `auto`. 
  - MatchID can be found at the start of a match before the accept match popup comes up `match_id=3243320471183730331` > `3243320471183730331`
  - `auto` will automatically find the match ID for you
  -  **Requires** an account filled in the `fetcher` section

# Proxies
Proxies are simple to use, just follow the example config to set them up. Your proxy file will need to be either a JSON array with each element being one HTTP proxy *or* a plain text file with each line being one proxy. One proxy can do ~20 commends, so I recommend leaving `switchProxyEveryXaccounts` at `20`.

**ONLY HTTP proxies are supported**

JSON Example:
```JSON
[
    ""127.0.0.1:12345"",
    ""127.0.0.1:67890"",
    ""127.0.0.2:12345"",
    ""127.0.0.2:67890""
]
```

Plain text example:
```
127.0.0.1:12345
127.0.0.1:67890
127.0.0.2:12345
127.0.0.2:67890
```

# Frequently Asked Questions

- I am getting timeout errors
  - You cannot use this bot on a live Valve Competitive/Wingman match, however it does work at the end of the match when the last round ends. Otherwise just use Community Servers or Valve Casual/Deathmatch/War Games/etc. Offline with bots or local workshop maps do not work.

- Can I get banned for using this?
  - Who knows, maybe, maybe not. Its unlikely but you never know. Valve usually *at most* disables the bot accounts.

- I get an error when trying `npm ci`
  - As said in the README, make sure to install [**NodeJS version 12**](https://nodejs.org/dist/v12.9.1/). On Windows you will need to download the `node-v12.9.1-x64.msi`.

- How many commends can I send?
  - One IP can do ~20 commends per 5 minutes
    - There don't seem to be any other way to increase this, I tried modifying several things and nothing ever worked
  - Its *possible* there is a server limit as well of ~150 commends. This is unconfirmed and might not be true.
  - *Note: This information may be outdated*

- I get a proxy error!
  - Your proxy has been banned by Steam. Search for residential proxies, and even then they might be banned.

- I get an ""Failed to commend"" error
  - This is likely an error on your side, if it worked before and you cannot resolve the issue [look through the issue list on Github and open a new one if required](https://github.com/BeepIsla/csgo-commend-bot/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue).

- The config is confusing, can you make an interface for it?
  - I can but I won't. It doesn't accomplish anything and learning how this works is easy.

- Can I make an automated commend selling service with this?
  - This is **not** usable on a big scale, especially when botting several people at once.

- Can you do X for me?
  - No, I only work for myself.

- Can you do X for me? I pay!
  - No, I don't care about money.

- I found someone who copied this and is selling it/released it without mentioning you.
  -  Good for them, I don't care. I have still made the accomplishment, not them.

# Why I think report bots are fixed

Lets start by saying: **None of this is confirmed, nobody knows what the truth is so these are just assumptions.**

Aside from [**Valve literally saying they are fixed**](https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/89qk3l/i_emailed_a_valve_employee_about_csgo_and_got_a/dwtqe94/) every match (Competitive, Wingman, Danger Zone, etc) has a list of account IDs which are allowed to join/participate, so when a report gets sent all Valve has to do is check if the sender and receiver are in the same match or not.

Now you could argue why doesn't the same happen when commending or why do they give a fake response? The answer is: Community servers.

Commending must work on community servers so it is not as strict as reporting. Reporting on the other hand is completely irrelevant on community servers, there is no reason why Valve should use them especially considering community servers may give advantages to some players, so reporting simply returns a fake response.

- Is sender and receiver assigned to the same Valve match?
  - Yes: Real report
  - No: Is the server ID the same for sender and receiver?
    - Yes: Send a fake response
    - No: Do not respond at all

## Install dependencies

Run:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To install development dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
pre-commit install
python -m spacy download en_core_web_md en
python -m spacy link en_core_web_md en
```

> With pre-commit installed, the `black` and `doctoc` hooks will run on every `git commit`.
> If any changes are made by the hooks, you will need to re-add changed files and re-commit your changes.

## Run the bot

Use `rasa train` to train a model.

Then, to run, first set up your action server in one terminal window, listening on port 5056:
```bash
rasa run actions --port 5056
```

Note that port 5056 is used for the action server, to avoid a conflict when you also run the helpdesk bot as described below in the `handoff` section.

In another window, run the duckling server (for entity extraction):

```bash
docker run -p 8000:8000 rasa/duckling
```

Then to talk to the bot, run:
```
rasa shell --debug
```

Note that `--debug` mode will produce a lot of output meant to help you understand how the bot is working
under the hood. To simply talk to the bot, you can remove this flag.


You can also try out your bot locally using Rasa X by running
```
rasa x
```

Refer to our guided workflow in the [Wiki page](https://github.com/RasaHQ/financial-demo/wiki/Using-Rasa-X-with-the-Financial-Demo) for how to get started with Rasa X in local mode.


## Overview of the files

`data/nlu/nlu.yml` - contains NLU training data

`data/nlu/rules.yml` - contains rules training data

`data/stories/stories*.yml` - contains stories training data

`actions.py` - contains custom action/api code

`domain.yml` - the domain file, including bot response templates

`config.yml` - training configurations for the NLU pipeline and policy ensemble

`tests/` - end-to-end tests


## Things you can ask the bot

The bot currently has five skills. You can ask it to:
1. Transfer money to another person
2. Check your earning or spending history (with a specific vendor or overall)
3. Answer a question about transfer charges
4. Pay a credit card bill
5. Tell you your account balance

It also has a limited ability to switch skills mid-transaction and then return to the transaction at hand.

For the purposes of illustration, the bot recognises the following fictional credit card accounts:

- `emblem`
- `justice bank`
- `credit all`
- `iron bank`

It recognises the following payment amounts (besides actual currency amounts):

- `minimum balance`
- `current balance`

It recognises the following vendors (for spending history):

- `Starbucks`
- `Amazon`
- `Target`

You can change any of these by modifying `actions.py` and the corresponding NLU data.

If configured, the bot can also hand off to another bot in response to the user asking for handoff. More [details on handoff](#handoff) below.

## Handoff

This bot includes a simple skill for handing off the conversation to another bot or a human.
This demo relies on [this fork of chatroom](https://github.com/RasaHQ/chatroom) to work, however you
could implement similar behaviour in another channel and then use that instead. See the chatroom README for
more details on channel-side configuration.


Using the default set up, the handoff skill enables this kind of conversation with two bots:

<img src=""./handoff.gif"" width=""200"">


### Try it out

The simplest way to use the handoff feature is to do the following:

1. Clone [chatroom](https://github.com/RasaHQ/chatroom) and [Helpdesk-Assistant](https://github.com/RasaHQ/helpdesk-assistant) alongside this repo
2. In the chatroom repo, install the dependencies:
```bash
yarn install
```
3. In the chatroom repo, build and serve chatroom:
```bash
yarn build
yarn serve
```
4. In the Helpdesk-Assistant repo, install the dependencies and train a model (see the Helpdesk-Assistant README)
5. In the Helpdesk-Assistant repo, run the rasa server and action server at the default ports (shown here for clarity)
   In one terminal window:
    ```bash
    rasa run --enable-api --cors ""*"" --port 5005 --debug
    ```
    In another terminal window:
    ```bash
    rasa run actions --port 5055 --debug
    ```
6. In the Financial-Demo repo (i.e. this repo), run the rasa server and action server at **the non-default ports shown below**
   In one terminal window:
    ```bash
    rasa run --enable-api --cors ""*"" --port 5006 --debug
    ```
    In another terminal window:
    ```bash
    rasa run actions --port 5056 --debug
    ```
7. Open `chatroom_handoff.html` in a browser to see handoff in action


### How it works

Using chatroom, the general approach is as follows:

1. User asks original bot for a handoff.
2. The original bot handles the request and eventually
   sends a message with the following custom json payload:
    ```
        {
            ""handoff_host"": ""<url of handoff host endpoint>"",
            ""title"": ""<title for bot/channel handed off to>""
            }
    ```
    This message is not displayed in the Chatroom window.
3. Chatroom switches the host to the specified `handoff_host`
4. The original bot no longer receives any messages.
5. The handoff host receives the message `/handoff{""from_host"":""<original bot url"">}`
6. The handoff host should be configured to respond to this message with something like,
   ""Hi, I'm <so and so>, how can I help you??""
7. The handoff host can send a message in the same format as specified above to hand back to the original bot.
   In this case the same pattern repeats, but with
   the roles reversed. It could also hand off to yet another bot/human.

### Bot-side configuration

The ""try it out"" section doesn't require any further configuration; this section is for those
who want to change or further understand the set up.

For this demo, the user can ask for a human, but they'll be offered a bot (or bots) instead,
so that the conversation looks like this:


For handoff to work, you need at least one ""handoff_host"". You can specify any number of handoff hosts in the file `actions/handoff_config.yml`.
```
handoff_hosts:
    helpdesk_assistant:
      title: ""Helpdesk Assistant""
      url: ""http://localhost:5005""
    ## you can add more handoff hosts to this list e.g.
    # moodbot:
    #   title: ""MoodBot""
    #   url: ""http://localhost:5007""
```

Handoff hosts can be other locally running rasa bots, or anything that serves responses in the format that chatroom
accepts. If a handoff host is not a rasa bot, you will of course want to update the response text to tell the user
who/what they are being handed off to.

The [Helpdesk-Assistant](https://github.com/RasaHQ/helpdesk-assistant) bot has been set up to handle handoff in exactly the same way as Helpdesk-Assistant,
so the simplest way to see handoff in action is to clone Financial-Demo alongside this repo.

If you list other locally running bots as handoff hosts, make sure the ports on which the various rasa servers & action servers are running do not conflict with each other.


## Testing the bot

You can test the bot on the test conversations by:

- start duckling
- running  `rasa test`.

This will run [end-to-end testing](https://rasa.com/docs/rasa/user-guide/testing-your-assistant/#end-to-end-testing) on the conversations in `tests/test_stories.yml`.

All tests must pass.



## Rasa X Deployment

To [deploy financial-demo](https://rasa.com/docs/rasa/user-guide/how-to-deploy/), it is highly recommended to make use of the [one line deploy script](https://rasa.com/docs/rasa-x/installation-and-setup/one-line-deploy-script/) for Rasa X. 

As part of the deployment, you'll need to set up [git integration](https://rasa.com/docs/rasa-x/installation-and-setup/integrated-version-control/#connect-your-rasa-x-server-to-a-git-repository) to pull in your data and configurations, and build or pull an action server image.


## Action Server Image

You will need to have docker installed in order to build the action server image. If you haven't made any changes to the action code, you can also use the [public image on Dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/r/rasa/financial-demo) instead of building it yourself.

To build & tag the image, run:

```bash
export ACTION_SERVER_DOCKERPATH=<dockerID>/<name-of-image>:<tag-of-image>
make docker-build
```

Run the action server container:

```bash
make docker-run
```

Perform a smoke test on the health endpoint:

```bash
make docker-test
```

Once you have confirmed that the container is working, push the container image to a registry:

```bash
# login to a container registry with your credentials
docker login  

# check the registry logged into
docker system info | grep Registry

# push the action server image
make docker-push
```

# CI/CD

## Summary

As explained in the [Setting up CI/CD](https://rasa.com/docs/rasa/setting-up-ci-cd) section of the Rasa documentation, Continous Integration (**CI**) is the practice of merging in code changes frequently and automatically testing changes as they are committed. Continuous Deployment (**CD**) means automatically deploying integrated changes to a staging or production environment. Together, they allow you to make more frequent improvements to your assistant and efficiently test and deploy those changes.

A CI/CD pipeline is used to test, build and deploy the financial-demo bot to AWS EKS.

The pipeline uses GitHub Actions, defined in  `.github/workflows/cicd.yml`. It includes these jobs:

![](images/cicd.png)

**[params](https://github.com/RasaHQ/financial-demo/blob/d40467b4fb2a7d4fb072b86a2828a8cec662eb63/.github/workflows/cicd.yml#L26)**

- Performs smoke tests to ensure basic operations are all OK.



## GitHub Secrets

Secrets can be added to your GitHub repository by going to `Settings > Secrets` and selecting `New repository secret`. 

When entering values, be sure to omit quotes.

#### AWS IAM User API Keys:

To configure the aws cli in Github Actions, create IAM User API Keys as described below, and add them as GitHub secrets to the repository:

- AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = `Access key ID`
- AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = `Secret access key` 

#### Rasa Enterprise License:

To define a pull secret in Github Actions for the private GCR repo, you'll need to retrieve the private values from your Rasa Enterprise license file ([docs](https://rasa.com/docs/rasa-x/installation-and-setup/install/helm-chart#5-configure-rasa-x-image)) and add them as GitHub secrets to the repository:

- GCR_AUTH_JSON_PRIVATE_KEY_ID = `private_key_id`
- GCR_AUTH_JSON_PRIVATE_KEY = `private_key`
- GCR_AUTH_JSON_CLIENT_EMAIL = `client_email`
- GCR_AUTH_JSON_CLIENT_ID = `client_id`

An alternative approach to GCR repo authentication would be with the [gcloud credential helper](https://cloud.google.com/container-registry/docs/advanced-authentication#gcloud-helper).

#### Helm chart Credentials

To use safe_credentials in Github Actions through `values.yml` ([docs](https://rasa.com/docs/rasa-x/installation-and-setup/install/helm-chart#3-configure-credentials)), add following GitHub Secrets to the repo, replacing each `<safe credential>` with a different alphanumeric string and choosing a `<username>` for the initial user. 

*(Please use **safe credentials** to avoid data breaches)*

- GLOBAL_POSTGRESQL_POSTGRESQLPASSWORD = `<safe credential>`
- GLOBAL_REDIS_PASSWORD = `<safe credential>`
- RABBITMQ_RABBITMQ_PASSWORD = `<safe credential>`
- RASAX_INITIALUSER_USERNAME = `<username>`
- RASAX_INITIALUSER_PASSWORD = `<safe credential>`
- RASAX_JWTSECRET = `<safe credential>`
- RASAX_PASSWORDSALT = `<safe credential>`
- GLOBAL_POSTGRESQL_POSTGRESQLPASSWORD = `<safe credential>`
- GLOBAL_POSTGRESQL_POSTGRESQLPASSWORD = `<safe credential>`



## AWS Preparation

The CI/CD pipeline of financial-demo uses AWS for all the storage & compute resources.

After cloning or forking the financial-demo GitHub repository you must set up the following items before the pipeline can run.

### IAM User API Keys

The CI/CD pipeline uses the [aws cli](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2-linux.html#cliv2-linux-install).

The [aws cli](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2-linux.html#cliv2-linux-install) needs a set of IAM User API keys for authentication & authorization:

In your AWS Console, go to the IAM dashboard to create a new set of API keys:

  - Click on Users

  - Click on Add user

    - User name = findemo  *(The actual name is not important, we will never use this name directly)*

      Choose ""**programmatic access**."" This allows you to use the aws cli to interact with AWS.

    - Click on Next: Permissions

      - Click on *Attach existing policies directly*

        For IAM access, you can choose “**AdministratorAccess**”, or limit access to only what is needed by the CD pipeline.

    - Click on Next: Tags

    - Click on Next: Review

    - Click on Create user

    - Store in a safe location: `Access key ID` & `Secret access key`


### SSH Key Pair

To SSH into the EC2 worker nodes of the EKS cluster, you'll need an SSH Key Pair

- In your AWS Console, go to **EC2 > Key Pairs**, and create a Key Pair with the name `findemo`, and download the file `findemo.pem` which contains the private SSH key. 
  **Note that the name `findemo` is important, since it is used by the CI/CD pipeline when the cluster is created.**

### Local AWS CLI

Before the CI/CD pipeline can run, you will use the AWS CLI locally to create some resources and need to install & configure the CLI locally.

#### Install AWS CLI v2

See the [installation instructions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html).

#### Configure your AWS CLI

```bash
# AWS CLI version 2.1.26 or later
aws --version

# Configure AWS CLI
aws configure
AWS Access Key ID [None]: -----          # See above: IAM User API Keys
AWS Secret Access Key [None]: -------    # See above: IAM User API Keys
Default region name [None]: us-west-2    # The CI/CD pipeline uses us-west-2 
Default output format [None]: 

# Check your configuration
aws configure list [--profile profile-name]

# verify it works
aws s3 ls
```

### ECR repository & S3 bucket

The CI pipeline creates two artifacts:

- An action server docker **image**, which is pushed to an **AWS ECR** repository.
- A trained rasa **model**, which is copied to an **AWS S3** bucket

Run these commands to create the storage for these artifacts. These commands run the AWS CLI and create an ECR repository and an S3 bucket:

```bash

## EKS production cluster

If the production cluster is already set up, you can skip this section.

This section describes the initial deployment of the financial-demo bot on an EKS production cluster. 

This initial deployment is done manually. After that, the deployment is maintained & upgraded automatically by the CI/CD pipeline.

### Preparation

Before you can create or interact with an EKS cluster, you must install  `eksctl`, `kubectl`, `helm`, `jp`, and define some environment variables.

#### Install eksctl

See the [installation instructions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/eksctl.html)

If you use Ubuntu, you can issue the command:

```bash
make install-eksctl
```

#### Install kubectl

See the [installation instructions](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/#kubectl)

If you use Ubuntu, you can issue the command:

```bash
make install-kubectl
```

#### Install helm

See the [installation instructions](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/)

If you use Ubuntu, you can issue the command:

```bash
make install-helm
```

#### Install jp

See the [installation instructions](https://github.com/jmespath/jp#installing)

If you use Ubuntu, you can issue the command:

```bash
make install-jp
```

#### Set environment variables

There are many ways to set the required environment variables in your local environment. 

One way is to create a file  `./secret/envs_export`, with this content:

```bash
# source this file to set the environment variables the same as the GitHub secrets.
export GCR_AUTH_JSON_PRIVATE_KEY_ID=...
export GCR_AUTH_JSON_PRIVATE_KEY='-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-...-END PRIVATE KEY-----\n'
export GCR_AUTH_JSON_CLIENT_EMAIL='...'
export GCR_AUTH_JSON_CLIENT_ID=...
export GLOBAL_POSTGRESQL_POSTGRESQLPASSWORD=...
export GLOBAL_REDIS_PASSWORD=...
export RABBITMQ_RABBITMQ_PASSWORD=...
export RASAX_DEBUG_MODE=false
export RASAX_INITIALUSER_USERNAME=admin
export RASAX_INITIALUSER_PASSWORD=...
export RASAX_JWTSECRET=...
export RASAX_PASSWORDSALT=...
export RASAX_TOKEN=...
export RASA_TOKEN=...
```

Then, create the environment variables with the command:

```bash
source ./secret/envs_export
```

### Create the EKS cluster

Create the EKS production cluster, with name `financial-demo-production`:

```bash
make aws-eks-cluster-create AWS_EKS_CLUSTER_NAME=financial-demo-production
```

Some other useful 'Makefile functions' to interact with an EKS cluster:

```bash
make aws-eks-cluster-list-all

# in commands below, default name of cluster = financial-demo-<current branch name>
#
make aws-eks-cluster-describe AWS_EKS_CLUSTER_NAME=<name of cluster>
make aws-eks-cluster-describe-stacks AWS_EKS_CLUSTER_NAME=<name of cluster>
make aws-eks-cluster-delete AWS_EKS_CLUSTER_NAME=<name of cluster>
```

### Configure `kubeconfig`

Add the EKS  cluster information to `~/.kube/config`, and set the `current-context` to that cluster:

```bash
make aws-eks-cluster-update-kubeconfig AWS_EKS_CLUSTER_NAME=financial-demo-production

# make sure kubectl is now looking at the correct EKS cluster
make kubectl-config-current-context
```

### Install/Upgrade Rasa Enterprise

### Versions 

#### Select compatible versions

Get compatible versions for rasa-x, rasa and rasa-sdk from [compatibility matrix](https://rasa.com/docs/rasa-x/changelog/compatibility-matrix/)

For the rasa-x-helm chart, the latest version should work. When installing a very old version, you might need to use an older  helm chart version, selected with:

```bash
#.............NAME   URL
helm repo add rasa-x https://rasahq.github.io/rasa-x-helm
helm repo update

# .................NAME  /CHARTNAME
$ helm search repo rasa-x/rasa-x --versions
NAME         	CHART VERSION	APP VERSION	DESCRIPTION                                 
rasa-x/rasa-x	2.0.0        	0.41.1     	Rasa X Helm chart for Kubernetes / Openshift
rasa-x/rasa-x	1.16.0       	0.40.1     	Rasa X Helm chart for Kubernetes / Openshift
..
rasa-x/rasa-x	1.7.0        	0.33.0     	Rasa X Helm chart for Kubernetes / Openshift
rasa-x/rasa-x	1.6.13       	0.30.1     	Rasa X Helm chart for Kubernetes / Openshift
# NOTE: APP VERSION = Rasa X version
```



#### rasa & rasa-sdk

```bash
# file: requirements.txt
rasa[spacy]==2.5.2
rasa-sdk==2.5.0

# file: Dockerfile
FROM rasa/rasa-sdk:2.5.0
```



#### rasa-x & rasa-x-helm

```yaml
# file: Makefile

RASAX_TAG := 0.39.3
RASAX_HELM_CHART_VERSION := 2.0.0
```



#### Build & push action server docker image

Build, run, test & push the action docker server image, with name:

- `<ECR URI>/financial-demo:<current branch name>`

```bash
# check out the `main` branch.
# -> the branch name is used as the image tag
git checkout main

# build the image
make docker-build

# test it
make docker-run
make docker-test
make docker-stop

# Login & push the docker image to the AWS ECR repository
make aws-ecr-docker-login
make docker-push
```

#### Install/Upgrade Rasa Enterprise

Install/Upgrade Rasa Enterprise, using the action server docker image that was uploaded to the ECR repository:

```bash
# make sure kubectl is looking at the correct EKS cluster
make aws-eks-cluster-update-kubeconfig AWS_EKS_CLUSTER_NAME=financial-demo-production
# check it
make kubectl-config-current-context  AWS_EKS_CLUSTER_NAME=financial-demo-production

# check out the `main` branch.
# -> The action server docker image with tag = current branch name will be installed
git checkout main

# if you want to re-install rasa enterprise completely from scratch:
make rasa-enterprise-uninstall
make rasa-enterprise-delete-pvc-all
make aws-eks-namespace-delete

# create namespace `my-namespace`
make aws-eks-namespace-create

# create/refresh gcr-pull-secret, for Rasa Enterprise image
make pull-secret-gcr-create

# create/refresh ecr-pull-secret, for action server image
make pull-secret-ecr-create

# Install/Upgrade Rasa Enterprise with the action server
make rasa-enterprise-install

# Check Rasa Enterprise Health
make rasa-enterprise-check-health

# To troubleshoot, highly recommended to use OCTANT, see Appendix C
```

### Train, test & upload model to S3

```bash
# check out the `main` branch.
git checkout main

# Train the model: `models/<current branch>.tar.gz`
make rasa-train

# In another window, start duckling server
docker run -p 8000:8000 rasa/duckling

# Run the end-to-end tests
make rasa-test

# Upload `models/<current branch>.tar.gz` to S3
# Note: This does not mean the model is deployed to Rasa Enterprise,
#       which is done in the next step.
make aws-s3-upload-rasa-model
```

### Deploy, Tag & Smoketest the trained model

```bash
# Configure ~/.kube/config and set current_context
make aws-eks-cluster-update-kubeconfig  AWS_EKS_CLUSTER_NAME=financial-demo-production

# Deploy rasa model
make aws-s3-download-rasa-model
make rasa-enterprise-model-delete
make rasa-enterprise-model-upload
make rasa-enterprise-model-tag

# Wait about 1 minute, so rasa-production can download, upack & load the model

# Smoketest
make rasa-enterprise-smoketest
```

### DNS

Optionally, if you want to access Rasa Enterprise at your own (sub)-domain name, define a DNS record of type CNAME with your domain service provider:

- **name of sub-domain**:  `aws-financial-demo`  

  *==> This example name will resolve to `aws-financial-demo.my-domain.com`*

- **Type**: `CNAME`

- **Content**: `--------.us-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com` 

  *==> This is the hostname of the External Application Load Balancer that AWS EKS created during the deployment. You can get this hostname with the command:*

  ```bash
  make rasa-enterprise-get-loadbalancer-hostname
  ```

- **TTL (Time to Live)**: 1 Hour

- **Priority**: 

It might take some time for things to propagate, but you can verify it with commands like nslookup & dig:

```bash
########################################################################
# use `nslookup -type`
nslookup -type=CNAME aws-financial-demo.my-domain.com
aws-financial-demo.my-domain.com canonical name = ---.us-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com.

########################################################################
# use `dig`
dig CNAME aws-financial-demo.my-domain.com
...
;; ANSWER SECTION:
aws-financial-demo.my-domain.com. ---- IN CNAME ---.us-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com.

```

Once propagated, you can access Rasa Enterprise at **http://aws-financial-demo.my-domain.com**

## Trouble Shooting

If something goes wrong with the CI/CD pipeline, you should:

- Browse the [workflow logs](https://github.com/RasaHQ/financial-demo/actions)
- Peek in [.github/workflows/cicd.yml](https://github.com/RasaHQ/financial-demo/blob/main/.github/workflows/cicd.yml) to see what the pipeline is doing at the moment of trouble
- Trouble shoot it from your local computer

The following steps will most likely reveal what is going wrong: 

- Before you can use the Makefile commands locally, follow the [Preparation](#preparation) steps:

  - Install eksctl, kubectl, helm, jp
  - Set the environment variables

- Then, configure kubectl, so you are looking at the correct EKS cluster.

  - To troubleshoot the EKS test cluster for your current branch

    ```bash
    make aws-eks-cluster-update-kubeconfig
    ```

  - To Troubleshoot the EKS production cluster

    ```bash
    make aws-eks-cluster-update-kubeconfig AWS_EKS_CLUSTER_NAME=financial-demo-production
    ```

- Make sure you are now looking at the correct cluster by checking the current context:

  ```bash
  make kubectl-config-current-context
  ```

- Then, issue these commands to check things out.

  - Trouble shoot the EKS cluster

    ```bash
    # Check the available commands for the `aws-eks` cluster:
    $ make aws-eks # Do NOT press `Enter`, but press the `Tab` key twice
    aws-eks-cluster-create                    aws-eks-cluster-info
    aws-eks-cluster-delete                    aws-eks-cluster-list-all
    aws-eks-cluster-describe                  aws-eks-cluster-status
    aws-eks-cluster-describe-stacks           aws-eks-cluster-update-kubeconfig
    aws-eks-cluster-exists                    aws-eks-namespace-create
    aws-eks-cluster-get-certificateAuthority  aws-eks-namespace-delete
    aws-eks-cluster-get-endpoint
    
    # Trouble shoot the cluster
    make aws-eks-cluster-exists
    make aws-eks-cluster-status
    make aws-eks-cluster-info
    ```

  - Trouble shoot the S3 storage of the trained model

    ```bash
    # Check the available commands for the `aws-s3` bucket:
    make aws-s3 # Do NOT press `Enter`, but press the `Tab` key twice
    aws-s3-create-bucket        aws-s3-list-rasa-models
    aws-s3-delete-bucket        aws-s3-rasa-model-exists
    aws-s3-download-rasa-model  aws-s3-upload-rasa-model
    
    # Trouble shoot the S3 storage of the trained model
    make aws-s3-list-rasa-models
    make aws-s3-rasa-model-exists
    ```

  - Trouble shoot the ECR storage of the action server image

    ```bash
    # Check the available commands for the `aws-ecr` repository:
    make aws-ecr # Do NOT press `Enter`, but press the `Tab` key twice
    aws-ecr-create-repository        aws-ecr-get-repositoryUri
    aws-ecr-docker-login             aws-ecr-image-exists
    aws-ecr-get-authorization-token  aws-ecr-list-images
    
    # First, login to the ECR (This expires after a while, so redo it)
    make aws-ecr-docker-login
    
    # Then, Troubleshoot the ECR storage of the action server image
    make aws-ecr-list-images
    make aws-ecr-image-exists
    ```

    

  - Trouble shoot the Rasa Enterprise deployment

    ```bash
    # Check the available commands for the `rasa-enterprise` deployment:
    $ make rasa-e # Do NOT press `Enter`, but press the `Tab` key twice
    rasa-enterprise-check-health               rasa-enterprise-get-secrets-rabbit
    rasa-enterprise-get-access-token           rasa-enterprise-get-secrets-redis
    rasa-enterprise-get-base-url               rasa-enterprise-install
    rasa-enterprise-get-chat-token             rasa-enterprise-model-delete
    rasa-enterprise-get-loadbalancer-hostname  rasa-enterprise-model-tag
    rasa-enterprise-get-login                  rasa-enterprise-model-upload
    rasa-enterprise-get-pods                   rasa-enterprise-smoketest
    rasa-enterprise-get-secrets-postgresql     rasa-enterprise-uninstall
    
    # Trouble shoot the rasa enterprise deployment
    make rasa-enterprise-get-pods
    make rasa-enterprise-check-health
    make rasa-enterprise-smoketest
    ```

## Cleanup of AWS resources

The CI/CD pipeline creates unique artifacts and infrastructure for each branch. This is all cleaned up once a branch is deleted, by a special workflow `.github/workflows/cleanup.yml`.

You can also do a manual cleanup, either from the AWS CLI, or from the AWS Console.

### From the command line:

- AWS ECR:

  ```bash
  # list the action server images in the ECR
  make aws-ecr-list-images
  
  # delete the action server image of current branch
  make aws-ecr-delete-image
  
  # delete an action server image created by another branch
  make aws-ecr-delete-image GIT_BRANCH_NAME=my_other_branch
  ```

- AWS S3:

  ```bash
  # list the rasa models in the S3 bucket
  make aws-s3-list-rasa-models
  
  # delete the rasa model of current branch
  make aws-s3-delete-rasa-model
  
  # delete a rasa model created by another branch
  make aws-s3-delete-rasa-model GIT_BRANCH_NAME=my_other_branch
  ```

- AWS EKS:

  ```bash
  # list the EKS clusters
  make aws-eks-cluster-list-all
  
  # to delete ALL the test clusters
  make aws-eks-cluster-delete-all-test-clusters
  
  # delete the test cluster of the current branch
  make aws-eks-cluster-delete
  
  # delete a test cluster created by another branch
  make aws-eks-cluster-delete GIT_BRANCH_NAME=my_other_branch
  ```
  
  

### From the **AWS console**:

- AWS ECR:

  In the AWS Console, go to the ECR repository `financial-demo`, and delete the action server images.

- AWS S3:

  In the AWS Console, go to the S3 bucket `rasa-financial-demo` , and delete the rasa models.

- AWS EKS:

  In the AWS Console, go to CloudFormation, and delete all the stacks in reverse order as created by the `eksctl` command.

  When a stack fails to delete due to dependencies, you have two options:

    - Option 1: Manually delete the resources that the stack is not able to delete. (**RECOMMENDED**)

      You can do this by drilling down into the **CloudFormation stack delete events** messages and deleting items bottom-up the dependency tree.

      One example of a bottom-up delete sequence is when deletion of the VPC fails:

      - **EC2 > Load Balancers**: first, delete the ELB load balancer of the cluster. Look at the Tags to see what cluster a loadbalancer belongs to.
      - **VPC > Virtual Private Cloud: Subnets**: then, delete the two subnets of the cluster.  Look at the Name to see what cluster a subnet belongs to.
        - This will also delete the EC2 > Network interfaces, named `eni-xxxx`
        - You cannot delete Subnets until the ELB load balancers are deleted
      - **VPC > Virtual Private Cloud: Your VPCs**: finally, delete the VPC of the cluster. Look at the Name to see what cluster a VPC belongs to.
        - This will also delete all associated:
          - security groups (`sg-xxx`)
          - internet gateways (`igw-xxx`)
          - subnets (`subnet-xxx`)

      After cleaning up, try again to delete the **AWS CloudFormation** stack.

      If it still does not delete, iterate the manual cleanups until it does.

      Again, this can be a painful process, but once the CloudFormation stacks delete properly, you are guaranteed that you have cleaned up all the EKS related resources created by the CI/CD pipeline.

  - Option 2: Select to retain the resources that have dependency errors. (**NOT RECOMMENDED**)

    The stack delete operation will simply skip deleting them. This is NOT recommended, because you will clutter up your AWS account with many unused resources.

## Appendix A: The AWS EKS cluster

We use *eksctl* to create the clusters. It creates many AWS resources with CloudFormation templates. 

Some of these AWS resources are:

- A VPC with
  - Public & private subnets
  - Internet & NAT Gateways
  - Route Tables
- An IAM EKS service role
- An EKS Cluster Control Plane
- An EKS Managed nodegroup of EC2 instances

The cluster context is also added to the `~/.kube/config` file.

The VPC created looks something like this:

![](images/financial-demo-eks-test-vpc.png)

The EKS Control Plane interacts with the the EKS Data Plane (the nodes), like this:

![img](https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/fe2ef495a1152561572949784c16bf23abb28057/2020/04/10/subnet_pubpri.png)



## Appendix B: OCTANT

[Octant](https://octant.dev/) is a useful open sourced tool for visualizing workloads inside the cluster and troubleshooting issues when they arise.

### Install Octant

[Installation instructions](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/octant#installation)

#### Install on Ubuntu

```bash
cd ~
mkdir octant
cd octant
wget https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/octant/releases/download/v0.20.0/octant_0.20.0_Linux-64bit.deb
sudo dpkg -i octant_0.20.0_Linux-64bit.deb
```

### Run Octant

```bash
# #################################################### #
# Configure kubectl to look at the correct EKS cluster #
# #################################################### #

# -> for a feature branch test cluster
git checkout my-feature-branch

# -> for the production cluster
git branch production # create temporary, local `production` branch
git checkout production

# Configure kubeconfig for the correct EKS cluster
make aws-eks-cluster-update-kubeconfig

# make sure kubectl is now looking at the correct EKS cluster
make kubectl-config-current-context

# #################################################### #
# Run Octant on default port 7777 and open the browser #
# #################################################### #
OCTANT_LISTENER_ADDR=0.0.0.0:7777 octant &

# Within octant, select the namespace `my-namespace`
```

## Appendix D: AWS EKS references

There are two commands to create AWS EKS clusters;  `eksctl` & `aws eks`.  

- The `eksctl` cli is the most complete, and it is what we ended up using.

- The `aws eks` cli does not support to launch worker nodes to the cluster control plane. This has to be done manually from the AWS Console, which makes it unsuited for a CI/CD pipeline where everything needs to be done via scripting (=> infrastructure as code).

The following references are useful for learning about AWS EKS, and it is highly recommended to manually build test-clusters with both the `eksctl` & `aws eks` commands to help demystify the AWS resources that are being generated:

A simple Reddit bot in Python.

A software bot is a program that can interact with websites autonomously. They can be as simple or as complex as you want them to be.

The bot runs in the background and monitors a website. When it sees a change (like a post on Reddit), it can reply to it, upvote, or do any other task it was programmed to.

385,385,Anorov/cloudflare-scrape,Python,"cloudflare-scrape
=================

A simple Python module to bypass Cloudflare's anti-bot page (also known as ""I'm Under Attack Mode"", or IUAM), implemented with [Requests](https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests). Python versions 2.6 - 3.7 are supported. Cloudflare changes their techniques periodically, so I will update this repo frequently.

This can be useful if you wish to scrape or crawl a website protected with Cloudflare. Cloudflare's anti-bot page currently just checks if the client supports JavaScript, though they may add additional techniques in the future.

Due to Cloudflare continually changing and hardening their protection page, cloudflare-scrape requires Node.js to solve JavaScript challenges. This allows the script to easily impersonate a regular web browser without explicitly deobfuscating and parsing Cloudflare's JavaScript.

Note: This only works when regular Cloudflare anti-bots is enabled (the ""Checking your browser before accessing..."" loading page). If there is a reCAPTCHA challenge, you're out of luck. Thankfully, the JavaScript check page is much more common.

For reference, this is the default message Cloudflare uses for these sorts of pages:

    Checking your browser before accessing website.com.

    This process is automatic. Your browser will redirect to your requested content shortly.

    Please allow up to 5 seconds...

Any script using cloudflare-scrape will sleep for 5 seconds for the first visit to any site with Cloudflare anti-bots enabled, though no delay will occur after the first request.

Installation
============

Simply run `pip install cfscrape`. You can upgrade with `pip install -U cfscrape`. The PyPI package is at https://pypi.python.org/pypi/cfscrape/

Alternatively, clone this repository and run `python setup.py install`.

Node.js dependency
============

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) version 10 or above is required to interpret Cloudflare's obfuscated JavaScript challenge.

Your machine may already have Node installed (check with `node -v`). If not, you can install it with `apt-get install nodejs` on Ubuntu >= 18.04 and Debian >= 9 and `brew install node` on macOS. Otherwise, you can get it from [Node's download page](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) or [their package manager installation page](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/).


Updates
=======

Cloudflare regularly modifies their anti-bot protection page and improves their bot detection capabilities.

If you notice that the anti-bot page has changed, or if this module suddenly stops working, please create a GitHub issue so that I can update the code accordingly.

* Many issues are a result of users not updating to the latest release of this project. Before filing an issue, please run the following command to update cloudflare-scrape to the latest version:

```
pip install -U cfscrape
```

If you are still encountering a problem, create a GitHub issue and please include:

* The version number from `pip show cfscrape`.
* The relevant code snippet that's experiencing an issue or raising an exception.
* The full exception and traceback, if applicable.
* The URL of the Cloudflare-protected page which the script does not work on.
* A Pastebin or Gist containing the HTML source of the protected page.


If you've upgraded and are still experiencing problems, **[click here to create a GitHub issue and fill out the pertinent information](https://github.com/Anorov/cloudflare-scrape/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&template=bug-report-template.md&title=)**.

Usage
=====

The simplest way to use cloudflare-scrape is by calling `create_scraper()`.

```python
import cfscrape

scraper = cfscrape.create_scraper()  # returns a CloudflareScraper instance
# Or: scraper = cfscrape.CloudflareScraper()  # CloudflareScraper inherits from requests.Session
print scraper.get(""http://somesite.com"").content  # => ""<!DOCTYPE html><html><head>...""
```

That's it. Any requests made from this session object to websites protected by Cloudflare anti-bot will be handled automatically. Websites not using Cloudflare will be treated normally. You don't need to configure or call anything further, and you can effectively treat all websites as if they're not protected with anything.

You use cloudflare-scrape exactly the same way you use Requests. (`CloudflareScraper` works identically to a Requests `Session` object.) Just instead of calling `requests.get()` or `requests.post()`, you call `scraper.get()` or `scraper.post()`. Consult [Requests' documentation](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/user/quickstart/) for more information.

## Options

### Existing session

If you already have an existing Requests session, you can pass it to `create_scraper()` to continue using that session.

```python
session = requests.session()
session.headers = ...
scraper = cfscrape.create_scraper(sess=session)
```

Unfortunately, not all of Requests' session attributes are easily transferable, so if you run into problems with this, you should replace your initial `sess = requests.session()` call with `sess = cfscrape.create_scraper()`.

### Delays

Normally, when a browser is faced with a Cloudflare IUAM challenge page, Cloudflare requires the browser to wait 5 seconds before submitting the challenge answer. If a website is under heavy load, sometimes this may fail. One solution is to increase the delay (perhaps to 10 or 15 seconds, depending on the website). If you would like to override this delay, pass the `delay` keyword argument to `create_scraper()` or `CloudflareScraper()`.

There is no need to override this delay unless cloudflare-scrape generates an error recommending you increase the delay.

```python
scraper = cfscrape.create_scraper(delay=10)
```

## Integration

It's easy to integrate cloudflare-scrape with other applications and tools. Cloudflare uses two cookies as tokens: one to verify you made it past their challenge page and one to track your session. To bypass the challenge page, simply include both of these cookies (with the appropriate user-agent) in all HTTP requests you make.

To retrieve just the cookies (as a dictionary), use `cfscrape.get_tokens()`. To retrieve them as a full `Cookie` HTTP header, use `cfscrape.get_cookie_string()`.

`get_tokens` and `get_cookie_string` both accept Requests' usual keyword arguments (like `get_tokens(url, proxies={""http"": ""socks5://localhost:9050""})`). Please read [Requests' documentation on request arguments](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/api/#requests.Session.request) for more information.

*User-Agent Handling*

The two integration functions return a tuple of `(cookie, user_agent_string)`. **You must use the same user-agent string for obtaining tokens and for making requests with those tokens, otherwise Cloudflare will flag you as a bot.** That means you have to pass the returned `user_agent_string` to whatever script, tool, or service you are passing the tokens to (e.g. curl, or a specialized scraping tool), and it must use that passed user-agent when it makes HTTP requests.

If your tool already has a particular user-agent configured, you can make cloudflare-scrape use it with `cfscrape.get_tokens(""http://somesite.com/"", user_agent=""User-Agent Here"")` (also works for `get_cookie_string`). Otherwise, a randomly selected user-agent will be used.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Integration examples

Remember, you must always use the same user-agent when retrieving or using these cookies. These functions all return a tuple of `(cookie_dict, user_agent_string)`.

**Retrieving a cookie dict through a proxy**

`get_tokens` is a convenience function for returning a Python dict containing Cloudflare's session cookies. For demonstration, we will configure this request to use a proxy. (Please note that if you request Cloudflare clearance tokens through a proxy, you must always use the same proxy when those tokens are passed to the server. Cloudflare requires that the challenge-solving IP and the visitor IP stay the same.)

If you do not wish to use a proxy, just don't pass the `proxies` keyword argument. These convenience functions support all of Requests' normal keyword arguments, like `params`, `data`, and `headers`.

```python
import cfscrape

proxies = {""http"": ""http://localhost:8080"", ""https"": ""http://localhost:8080""}
tokens, user_agent = cfscrape.get_tokens(""http://somesite.com"", proxies=proxies)
print tokens
# => {'cf_clearance': 'c8f913c707b818b47aa328d81cab57c349b1eee5-1426733163-3600', '__cfduid': 'dd8ec03dfdbcb8c2ea63e920f1335c1001426733158'}
```

**Retrieving a cookie string**

`get_cookie_string` is a convenience function for returning the tokens as a string for use as a `Cookie` HTTP header value.

This is useful when crafting an HTTP request manually, or working with an external application or library that passes on raw cookie headers.

```python
import cfscrape
request = ""GET / HTTP/1.1\r\n""

cookie_value, user_agent = cfscrape.get_cookie_string(""http://somesite.com"")
request += ""Cookie: %s\r\nUser-Agent: %s\r\n"" % (cookie_value, user_agent)

print request

# GET / HTTP/1.1\r\n
# Cookie: cf_clearance=c8f913c707b818b47aa328d81cab57c349b1eee5-1426733163-3600; __cfduid=dd8ec03dfdbcb8c2ea63e920f1335c1001426733158
# User-Agent: Some/User-Agent String
```

**curl example**

Here is an example of integrating cloudflare-scrape with curl. As you can see, all you have to do is pass the cookies and user-agent to curl.

```python
import subprocess
import cfscrape

# With get_tokens() cookie dict:

# tokens, user_agent = cfscrape.get_tokens(""http://somesite.com"")
# cookie_arg = ""cf_clearance=%s; __cfduid=%s"" % (tokens[""cf_clearance""], tokens[""__cfduid""])

# With get_cookie_string() cookie header; recommended for curl and similar external applications:

cookie_arg, user_agent = cfscrape.get_cookie_string(""http://somesite.com"")

# With a custom user-agent string you can optionally provide:

# ua = ""Scraping Bot""
# cookie_arg, user_agent = cfscrape.get_cookie_string(""http://somesite.com"", user_agent=ua)

result = subprocess.check_output([""curl"", ""--cookie"", cookie_arg, ""-A"", user_agent, ""http://somesite.com""])
```

Trimmed down version. Prints page contents of any site protected with Cloudflare, via curl. (Warning: `shell=True` can be dangerous to use with `subprocess` in real code.)

```python
url = ""http://somesite.com""
cookie_arg, user_agent = cfscrape.get_cookie_string(url)
cmd = ""curl --cookie {cookie_arg} -A {user_agent} {url}""
print(subprocess.check_output(cmd.format(cookie_arg=cookie_arg, user_agent=user_agent, url=url), shell=True))
```

# Informer - Telegram Mass Surveillance

## Update 08-23-2021
* Updated to latest Telethon 1.23.0
* Fixed database issues by migrating to docker-compose
* Made Google Spreadsheets optional in setup
* Secure ENV files for setup
* Easier setup
* Replaced docker-compose in lieu of App Engine bc AE sux

## About
**Informer (TGInformer) is a bot library that allows you to masquerade as multiple REAL users on telegram** and spy on 500+ Telegram channels **per account**. Details are logged to a MySQL database, a private Google Sheet and your own private channel for analysis.

This is a functioning proof-of-concept project with known bugs. Feel free to fork, share and drop me a line.

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paulpierre/informer/master/github/screenshots/13.png)


## Potential Business Applications
* Sock puppeteering to overthrow a despotic regime
* Brand monitoring and sentiment analysis
* Shilling cryptocurrency at a moments notice for financial gain
* Influencing sentiment on topical issues
* Getting in on price action early
* Running analysis of a telegram channel


## Features
* Run all your bots in the cloud while you sleep. Support for Docker Compose

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paulpierre/informer/master/github/screenshots/14.png)

* Write all notifications to private Google Sheet

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paulpierre/informer/master/github/screenshots/9.png)

* Supports regular expressions for keyword filtering

* SQLAlchemy for agnostic data persistence

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paulpierre/informer/master/github/screenshots/8.png)

* Logging contextual message and channel data to a private channel and database

* Stores meta information about sender of message, channel, number of participants in the channel

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paulpierre/informer/master/github/screenshots/7.png)

* Auto-joins channels from CSV list containing Telegram channel URLs

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paulpierre/informer/master/github/screenshots/10.png)

* Persists session of channels joined

* Login once, bot stays logged in forever without needing 2FA re-authentication

* Join up to 500 channels per account

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paulpierre/informer/master/github/screenshots/4.png)

* Uses REAL accounts avoiding bot detection, **THIS IS NOT A TELEGRAM BOT** but a real automated user account. This is an important distinction because the official bot API is limited and bots are often restricted in public channels.


## Requirements
### OS / Infrastructure
* Python 3+
* Docker (optional)
* Telegram (Desktop, Web or Mobile download: https://www.telegram.org/)
* Burner app

### Python packages
* SQLAlchemy (1.3.11)
* sqlalchemy-migrate (0.13.0)
* Telethon (1.10.8)
* mysql-connector-python (8.0.18)
* gspread (3.1.0)
* oauth2client (4.1.3)

## Quick Start

### Setup your ENV vars
Edit the file informer.env which contains all the required environmental variables for informer

You can retrieve the necessary Telegram-related information here:

### Setup Your Telegram App

1. Head over to `http://my.telegram.com/auth` to authenticate your account by providing a phone number and the confirmation code sent to your phone number (or Telegram)
![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paulpierre/informer/master/github/screenshots/1-2.png)

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paulpierre/informer/master/github/screenshots/1-5.png)


2. Once you are authenticated, click on ""API Development Tools""
![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paulpierre/informer/master/github/screenshots/1-3.png)

3. Go ahead and create a New Application by filling out the form shown below
![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paulpierre/informer/master/github/screenshots/1-4.png)

4. You should now have the necessary parameter values for the `informer.env` file fields `TELEGRAM_API_HASH` and `TELEGRAM_API_APP_ID`

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paulpierre/informer/master/github/screenshots/1-6.png)

5. Go ahead and replace the values, including `TELEGRAM_ACCOUNT_PHONE_NUMBER` and move on to the next section

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paulpierre/informer/master/github/screenshots/1-7.png)

### Getting your Telegram ID

So far we have what we need for Telethon and Informer to access the Telegram APIs, next we need to acquire the indentifiers for your bot's account.

1. Open Telegram and search for the user `userinfobot`.

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paulpierre/informer/master/github/screenshots/2-1.png)

2. You will see multiple, make sure you select the correctly spelled account.

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paulpierre/informer/master/github/screenshots/2-2.png)

3. Click on the user and you should see a dialog option at the bottom that says ""Start"". Click on this.

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paulpierre/informer/master/github/screenshots/2-3.png)

4. The bot has a single purpose, to reflect back to you your current Telegram account's information.

You should receive your Telegram username and your Telegram account ID. This is important

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paulpierre/informer/master/github/screenshots/1-8.png)

5. Go ahead and edit the `informer.env` file and fill in the values for `TELEGRAM_ACCOUNT_ID` which
should be your Telegram account ID from the previous step and `TELEGRAM_ACCOUNT_USER_NAME`.

You can optionally fill in `TELEGRAM_NOTIFICATIONS_CHANNEL_ID` with your user name or a channel ID.

6. Make sure you have `TELEGRAM_ACCOUNT_PHONE_NUMBER` filled out as this is key to generating the session. For creating multiple accounts, please check out the Burner App below.

### Initialize and authenticate session

Make sure you are running python 3 and simply run `./quick_start.sh` in the directory.

You must run this first so that you can authenticate with Telegram on the first run and generate a local session file

You can later copy the files for the different accounts in app/session and mount them via Docker should you choose to do so.

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paulpierre/informer/master/github/screenshots/15.png)

You will be prompted to enter in the authentication code you received either via Telegram if you have logged in before, or via SMS

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paulpierre/informer/master/github/screenshots/1-5.png)

Hit enter and your session should be generated in the folder `app/session` with the file name as the international phone number you provided with a `.session` extension.

Continue to the next section where we use Docker Compose to setup a database.


### Setup a Notification Channel

This step is optional, but if you would like to create a private group channel and would like to acquire the group ID do the following:

* Create a group (or channel) and set it as private or public
* Be sure to get the Telegram URL
![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paulpierre/informer/master/github/screenshots/3-1.png)

Set the URL in the `informer.env` file under the parameter `TELEGRAM_NOTIFICATIONS_CHANNEL_URL`

To get the channel ID simply run `python3 bot.py <TELEGRAM_ACCOUNT_ID>` in the `app` directory where `<TELEGRAM_ACCOUNT_ID>` is the account ID you previously generated.

When the script loads, it will display all the channels you are in, simply copy this value and put it in the `TELEGRAM_NOTIFICATIONS_CHANNEL_ID` parameter of the `informer.env` file and kill the script. You're now ready to run Informer.


### Running Docker Compose
After running `quick_start.sh` you can run docker compose by:

* running `./start.sh` to build the Docker containers which include the MySQL database

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paulpierre/informer/master/github/screenshots/16.png)


* Run `./stop.sh` to stop the containers

* Run `./clean.sh` to remove an dangling containers and volumes. ** NOTE ** this will RESET the database and you will lose all your data.

A few things to note:

Before you were required to run your own MySQL instance and this created some issues with connection string compatability and versioning. In this update, it is just created for you and persisted on disk.

Additionally Dozzle is provided so that you may view logs in your browser, simply go to http://localhost:9999 and click on the `app_informer` container.


### Create a telegram account with Burner App

If you do not want to use your own phone number and want to run the Informer bot with some degree of anonymity you can use the Burner App available on iOS and Android.

1. Install the app Burner

	* Android - https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.thunderdog.challegram&hl=en_US
	* iOS - https://apps.apple.com/us/app/telegram-x/id898228810

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paulpierre/informer/master/github/screenshots/3.png)

2. Follow the same steps as above by providing the new phone number here:
 https://my.telegram.org/auth

3. Validate with Burner. You will be sent an authcode via SMS, you will need to provide

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paulpierre/informer/master/github/screenshots/1.png)

5. Log into Telegram

6.  Attempt to login with the app by running

`python3 bot.py <api_user_id>` in the `app` directory.

7. Since you are logging in with Telethon it will ask you for your authcode in the terminal like earlier.

This was  sent via Telegram message or SMS.

Provide this and it will save your session credentials in the session file mentioned below. You will no longer need to authenticate so long as you have the session file saved.

Sessions are saved in the `app/session/` folder as `<telegram_phone_number>.session`

Rinse and repeat until you have all the necessary session files and simply mount them in Docker.


## Scaling Telegram accounts
Figuring out how to scale accounts was a bit of a nightmare as I needed an automated process. Telegram requires you use a real phone number that can recieve texts from a shortcode.

Unfortunately services with APIs like Twilio are prohibited from receiving SMS from shortcodes in the US, Canada and UK https://support.twilio.com/hc/en-us/articles/223181668-Can-Twilio-numbers-receive-SMS-from-a-short-code- for fraud purposes. This would’ve been ideal, bahumbug.

A whole evening was wasted on this endeavor until I remembered a great app I used in the past: Burner (https://www.burnerapp.com/)  — which coincidentally does have an API (https://developer.burnerapp.com/api-documentation/incoming-webhooks/).  Meaning you can dynamically generate numbers, instantiate a new account and authenticate it all via Telegram’s client SDK in Python (Telethon: https://docs.telethon.dev/en/latest/)

The best part is Burner numbers are free for 14 days. Telegram accounts connected via client API need only login once and permanently persist sessions. I have not integrated with the Burner API, but the process is straight forward.


### Telethon SDK
The bot is built on top of the Telethon Python SDK (https://docs.telethon.dev/en/latest/)

A few things to note and gotchas encountered in building this proof of concept:

1. **Rate Limiting**
Telegram does intense rate limiting which will throw FloodWaitErrors. 
In my research it seems like no one knows the algorithm for this but 
you want your back off waits to scale in response because when you 
violate and exceed the unknown rate limit, the waits become 
exponential. I’ve found a happy medium with my approach to waiting.

FloodWaitErrors can occur when you are submitting too many requests 
to the API whether it is querying users information or joining  too many 
channels too fast

2. **Telethon Sessions**
Telethon will create a session file. You can set the name of the session 
file when you instantiate the Telethon client: 

`TelegramClient(<session_file_name>, <api_user_id>, <api_user_hash>)`

	This file happens to be a sqlite database which you can connect to. It 	
	acts like a cache and stores historical data as well as your session 
	authentication information so you will not have to re-authenticate with 
	Telegram’s 2FA . Note that you will need to login for a first time and 
	authenticate when you first use the API.

## Managing Multiple Bot Accounts

As the bot runs and joins channel, you will see your client update in real time and display the new channels you have joined.

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paulpierre/informer/master/github/screenshots/4.png)

TIP: TelegramX is by far the better client to use for these purposes as it supports multiple login. Download here:

* Android - https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.thunderdog.challegram&hl=en_US
* iOS - https://apps.apple.com/us/app/telegram-x/id898228810


## Google Sheets Integration
The python library gspread is used for managing io with Google Sheets. You will need to have a Google Cloud Platform account and enable Google Drive APIs. Afterwards you must generate server credentials with a json api key.

Instructions are here: https://www.twilio.com/blog/2017/02/an-easy-way-to-read-and-write-to-a-google-spreadsheet-in-python.html

This is optional.


## Known Bugs
* Currently a channel must have already been joined in order to begin monitoring of keywords. It is likely you will need to run the `bot.py` twice, once to let it join channels and another time to monitor them. I’m aware of this glaring bug and will fix it in the next revision.


## Todo
* Create user interface dashboard for bot management
	* Create new accounts
	* Add / remove channels
	* Add / remove keywords to monitor
	* View notifications 
	* Recieve web push notifications
* Automatically poll the database to update the keywords to monitor in memory
* Automate creation of phone numbers via Burner API and authcode process

The DOTS project used for the presentation Converting Your Game to DOTS and contains an example of how DOTS could be used to replace a low performance process in your games (shooting many bullets at once, in this case). This is meant to provide a simple, targeted example. A video presentation of this project can be seen [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNMrevfB6Q0)

## The basics
This project uses a combination of game objects and entities together. In this case, the player (game objets) spawns bullets (entity). There is an Enemy Spawner (game object) that spawns enemies (entities). When enemies die, they spawn particle effects (game objects). 

## Collision
Since the bullets and enemies are entities and the player is a game object, making them collide with the built in physics system won't work. As such, collision is handled by a system (CollisionSystem) and is very simplistic in nature. In this system general radius is used to calculate if bullets have collided with enemies or enemies with players. A more sophisticted collision algorithm, or even the new DOTS physics, could have been used, but this is meant to be a simple example and really isn't necessary. 

## The systems
Several systems are used to replace the monobehaviour functionality of the bullets and enemies
* MoveForwardSystem - Moves any entity with the MoveForward component forward at some speed
* TurnTowardsPlayerSystem - Turns enemy entities to face the player's position
* CollisionSystem - Detects simple radius collision between bullets, enemies, and players
* RemoveDeadSystem - Destroys any entities that have a Healt of zero or less
* TimedDestroySystem - Destroys any entities that have run out of time to live (bullets)
* PlayerTransformUpdateSystem - Due to the hybrid nature of the player game object, this sytem is needed to keep the entities position in sync with the game object's position

### 配置信息
> 这里主要是botWechatMap变量在后面的login过程限制了可以扫码的微信用户白名单
```
var _LANG = 'ch';//默认中文
const BOTCONFIG = {
  autoregistHello: 'hello bot',
  botWechatMap: {
    porbello: 'https://u.wechat.com/MG3oDlaSML_iJ3AN6me3Uv4'//不是随意的微信扫码都有效，这里配置了白名单
  },
  language: {
    ch: {
      hello: '您好，我是您的专属助手',
      //...等等其它语言
    }
  }
};
```
config/index.js
```
const config = {
	bot: {
      enable: true,//开启机器人服务
      tokens: ['puppet_padlocal_e55XXXXXXXX55906d2']//如果有多个token，可以启动多个实例
  	},
}
```

### 启动wechaty实例
```
var bots = [];
if (config.bot && config.bot.enable) {
  for (let i = 0; i < config.bot.tokens.length; i++) {//如果有多个token，则循环运行实例
    const bot = new Wechaty({
      puppet: new PuppetPadlocal({
        token: config.bot.tokens[i]
      }),
      name: 'BotBay'
    });
    bot.cmx = bot.cmx || {};
    bot.cmx.use = false;
    bots.push(bot);
    bot
      .on('scan', (qrcode, status) => {
        bot.cmx.qrcode = qrcode;//有二维码时赋值
      })
      .on('login', async (user) => {
        console.log(`User ${user} logged in`);
        const contact = bot.userSelf();
        if (BOTCONFIG.botWechatMap[contact.id]) {
          console.log(`check pass`);
          bot.cmx.use = true;//本bot状态是否为待机
          bot.cmx.qrcode = '';//把二维码输出到前端管理页面用
          bot.cmx.wechatqr = BOTCONFIG.botWechatMap[contact.id];//给前端管理页面显示本bot对应的微信二维码
        } else {
          console.log(`check fail`);//如果不是白名单微信扫码，则强制登出，这里复现貌似登出后不能立刻回调到scan事件
          await bot.logout();
          //TOOD 不知道是否需要主动重启wechaty
        }

      })
      .on('logout', user => {
        console.log(`User ${user} log out`);
        bot.cmx.use = false;//bot状态置为待机
      })
      .on('error', e => console.info('Bot', 'error: %s', e))
      .on('message', message => onMessage(message, bot))
      .on('friendship', friendship => onFriendship(friendship, bot))
      .on('room-join', (room, inviteeList, inviter) => onRoomJoin(room, inviteeList, inviter, bot))
      .start();
  }
}
```
### 获取我自己的bot
```
async function getMyBot(wechatid) {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    Models.Botlists.findOne({//里面存储了每个人bot的信息
      wechatid: wechatid
    }).lean().exec((err, data) => {
      if (err || !data) resolve(false);
      else {
        if (data.owner) {
          Models.Userworkspacelinks.findOne({
            user: data.owner
          }).lean().exec((dmErr, dmData) => {
            if (dmErr || !dmData) resolve(false);
            else resolve(Object.assign(data, {
              workspace: dmData.workspace
            }));
          });
        } else {
          resolve(false);
        }
      }
    });
  });
}
```
其中bot的字段大致如下
```
const botlistsScheMa = new Schema({
    nickname: String,//昵称
    owner: String,//所属人
    expires: { type: Date },//过期时间
    state: { type: Number, default: 1 },//状态
    birthday: { type: Date, default: Date.now },//生日
    desc: String,//个人简介
    worldranking: Number,//排名
    level: Number,//等级
    wechatid: String,//关联微信号
    hello: String//自定义触发语
});

```
### 状态机状态枚举
1. HELLO - 初始化状态，新添加机器人为好友或使用“变身机器人”触发
2. WAITUSERNAME - 检查发现不明确用户账户，等待账户信息
3. WAITNICKNAME - 检查用户尚未给本机器人起名，等待昵称信息
4. FREE - 目前基础信息完整，响应交互

在下文中状态机在不同时机发生状态变化

### 添加好友
```
async function onFriendship(friendship, bot) {
  const contact = friendship.contact();
  if (friendship.type() === bot.Friendship.Type.Receive) { // 1. receive new friendship request from new contact
    let hasbotinfo = await ((key, wechatid) => {
      return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        Models.Botlists.findOne({
          $or: [{ hello: key }, { wechatid: wechatid }]//根据触发语或微信号检查是否已有机器人
        }).lean().exec((err, data) => {
          if (err) resolve(false);
          else resolve(data || false);
        });
      });
    })(friendship.hello(), contact.id);
    if (hasbotinfo === false && friendship.hello() == BOTCONFIG.autoregistHello) {//autoregistHello是默认通用的触发语
      hasbotinfo = 'new wechat user';
    }
    if (hasbotinfo !== false) {
      await friendship.accept();//接收好友申请
      console.log(`Request from ${contact.name()} is accept succesfully!`);
      if (hasbotinfo == 'new wechat user') {
        RedisClient.set('BOT-' + contact.id, 'WAITUSERNAME');//状态机置为等待账户名
        await fsmJob(bot, contact);
      } else {
        if (!isEmpty(hasbotinfo.nickname)) {
          RedisClient.set('BOT-' + contact.id, 'HELLO');//状态机置为打招呼
          await fsmJob(bot, contact, hasbotinfo.nickname);
        } else {
          RedisClient.set('BOT-' + contact.id, 'WAITNICKNAME');//状态机置为等待昵称
          await fsmJob(bot, contact);
        }
        await ((_query, _updatedata) => {
          return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
            Models.Botlists.updateOne(_query, _updatedata, (err, data) => {
              if (err) {
                console.error(err);
                resolve(false);
              } else resolve(data);
            });
          });
        })({
          _id: hasbotinfo._id
        }, {
          wechatid: contact.id//更新一下微信号
        });
      }
    } else {
      RedisClient.del('BOT-' + contact.id);
      console.log(`no exist botinfo from ${friendship.hello()}`);
    }
  } else if (friendship.type() === bot.Friendship.Type.Confirm) { // 2. confirm friendship
    console.log(`New friendship confirmed with ${contact.name()}`);
  }
}
```

### 接收消息
```
async function onMessage(msg, bot) {
  const contact = msg.talker();
  if (contact.id == 'wexin' || msg.self()) {
    return;
  }
  await fsmJob(bot, contact, msg, true);//直接调用状态机动作
}
```

### 状态机动作
```
async function fsmJob(bot, contact, msg, reply) {
  let FSM = await (() => {//查询当前用户状态
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
      RedisClient.get('BOT-' + contact.id, function (err, result) {
        if (err) {
          resolve(false);
        } else {
          resolve(result || '');
        }
      });
    });
  })();
  if (FSM)
    await botDoProcess[FSM](bot, contact, msg, reply);//直接执行对应动作
  else {//说明是新用户
    if (reply && msg) {//说明用户主动发消息给bot
      //...有若干代码，主要思想就是根据用户发的消息，进行相应处理
    }
  }
}
```
主要逻辑在botDoProcess变量中实现，
```
const botDoProcess = {
   WAITUSERNAME: async (bot, contact, msg, reply)=>{//接收到的是用户账户名，检查数据库是否存在，存在则与bot绑定},
   WAITNICKNAME: async (bot, contact, msg, reply)=>{//接收到的是bot昵称，更新数据库},
   FREE: async (bot, contact, msg, reply)=>{//处理指令【纪要、纪要发送邮箱、日报、帮助等】，对文本、音频、视频、附件、图片进行处理、归档、统计、分析},
   HELLO: async (bot, contact, nickname)=>{
     await contact.say(BOTCONFIG.language[_LANG].hello + nickname);
     RedisClient.set('BOT-' + contact.id, 'FREE');//空闲
     await fsmJob(bot, contact);
   },
}
```

### 分词与关键词提取
使用CppJieba提供底层分词算法实现

## paddleWorkers-提供chatbot支撑服务
> 本次只使用了图片OCR这一个功能，并且封装为http接口【因为pyton实现的paddleWorker，nodejs实现的botPlatform】，暴露给botPlatform使用，得力于paddlehub的组件成熟度，所以代码量很少，这里给paddlehub点个赞

```
from flask import request, Flask
import json
import paddlehub as hub
import cv2
import requests
import os


app = Flask(__name__)
ocr = None


@app.route('/imageOcr', methods=['GET'])
def image_ocr():
    path = request.args.get('imagePath')
    print(path)
    file_name = os.path.basename(path)
    file_down = requests.get(path)
    with open('/mnt/'+file_name,'wb') as f:
        f.write(file_down.content)
    ocr_res = ocr.recognize_text(images=[cv2.imread('/mnt/'+file_name)])
    data = ocr_res[0]['data']
    res_data = {}
    text = []
    for item in data:
        text.append(item['text'])
    res_data['msg'] = '请求成功'
    res_data['code'] = 200
    res_data['data'] = text
    os.remove('/mnt/'+file_name)
    return json.dumps(res_data,ensure_ascii=False)



def load_model():
    global ocr
    ocr = hub.Module(name=""chinese_ocr_db_crnn_server"")


if __name__ == ""__main__"":
    load_model()
    app.run(host=""0.0.0.0"", port=9000)

```
## webpages-实现前端页面
> 虽然写前端页面的工作相比于高大上的机器学习、深度学习、人工智能、自然语言处理这些门类，显得不上档次，但是有一个""友好一点点""的界面总还算是件好事。

基本上就是这个样子按组件化编写的页面
```
<a-col :xs=""24"" :sm=""12"" :md=""12"" :lg=""12"" :xl=""12"">
    <div class=""duplicate-file-item border-size p-size dark-bg9"">
    <p class=""item-title"">
        <img src=""~assets/img/information-archiving/icon@2x.png"" alt />群聊文件
    </p>
    <duplicate-file v-if=""fileBot.length"" :data=""fileBot""></duplicate-file>
    <a-empty
        v-else
        :image=""require('~/static/images/error/no-data@2x.png')""
        :image-style=""{
        height: '95px',
        }""
    >
        <span slot=""description"">暂无数据~</span>
    </a-empty>
    </div>
</a-col>
```
开发语言为VUE，使用Echarts的图表，这部分就不赘述如何开发的了，按设计稿实现就好了。

# 尚未解决问题
1. 目前版本基于状态机的消息处理逻辑是不能应答非标准化的指令的，可以通过引入自然语言处理和多轮对话技术辅助触发状态变化；
2. 由于wechaty原理基于微信号的消息收发，所以存在添加好友人数上线，目前本方案可支持不添加好友情况下，在微信群中@机器人的方式进行交互，但复杂场景下还是需要添加好友的。考虑到这点，botPlatform在最开始的配置信息中，预留了多个wechaty实例使用的token数组，并且通过循环创建的方式，可以在服务器端启动多个wechaty实例待机，并且根据策略派发实例响应用户交互（ps.不成熟）；
3. 基于wechaty作为消息收发中枢的模式无法满足生产环境下高可用的要求，如果一个实例宕机，其它实例目前没有平滑无缝接管服务的方式，所以只能多拜拜大神了。

## Whats new in 4.0?

* Bug fixes
* Clustering
* New router
* Web admin

## Get started

First of all you need to create your bot and get Token, you can do it right in telegram, just write to @BotFather.

Now let's write simple bot!

```js
'use strict'

const Telegram = require('telegram-node-bot')
const TelegramBaseController = Telegram.TelegramBaseController
const TextCommand = Telegram.TextCommand
const tg = new Telegram.Telegram('YOUR_TOKEN')

class PingController extends TelegramBaseController {
    /**
     * @param {Scope} $
     */
    pingHandler($) {
        $.sendMessage('pong')
    }

    get routes() {
        return {
            'pingCommand': 'pingHandler'
        }
    }
}

tg.router
    .when(
        new TextCommand('ping', 'pingCommand'),
        new PingController()
    )
```
That's it!

![Bot](ScreenShot.png)

## Introduction

I'm using something like MVC, so we have router and controllers.
First you need to declare your commands and which controller will handle it.
Then you need to write controllers and handle specific commands in it.

## Router
Lets say our bot has three commands: /start, /stop and /restart
And we want that commands to be handled by different controllers.

Router declaration code will be like this:

```js
tg.router
    .when(new TextCommand('/start', 'startCommand'), new StartController())
    .when(new TextCommand('/stop', 'stopCommand'), new StopController())
    .when(new TextCommand('/restart', 'restartCommand'), new RestartController())
```

Probably we will have a case when user send us command we didn't know, for that case router have `otherwise` function:

```js
tg.router
    .when(new TextCommand('/start', 'startCommand'), new StartController())
    .when(new TextCommand('/stop', 'stopCommand'), new StopController())
    .when(new TextCommand('/restart', 'restartCommand'), new RestartController())
    .otherwise(new OtherwiseController())
```

Now all unknown commands will be handled by OtherwiseController:

```js
class OtherwiseController extends TelegramBaseController {
    handle() {
        console.log('otherwise')
    }
}
```

In this cases for all controllers will be called `handle` method to handle request. But you can pass your custom handler name as second parameter to any command:

```js
tg.router
    .when(
        new TextCommand('/start', 'startHandler'),
        new StartController()
    )
```
Then you must add `routes` property to your controller like this:
```js
class StartConstoller extends TelegramBaseController {
    /**
     * @param {Scope} $
     */
    start($) {
        $.sendMessage('Hello!')
    }

    get routes() {
        return {
            'startHandler': 'start'
        }
    }
}
```

You can define controller for inline queries using `inlineQuery` method:

```js
tg.router
    .inlineQuery(new InlineModeController())
```

And controllers for callback queries using `callbackQuery`:

```js
tg.router
    .callbackQuery(new CallbackQueryController())
```

## List of all commands

* TextCommand - just text command like `/start`
```js
tg.router
    .when(
        new TextCommand('/start', 'startHandler'),
        new StartController()
    )
```
* RegextCommand - any regexp command
```js
tg.router
    .when(
        new RegexpCommand(/test/g, 'testHandler'),
        new TestController()
    )
```
* CustomFilterCommand - custom command
```js
tg.router
    .when(
        new CustomFilterCommand($ => {
            return $.message.text == 'some text'
        }, 'customFilterHandler'),
        new CustomFilterHandlerController()
    )
```

You can also create your own command, just extend `BaseCommand`


## Controllers

There are three types of controllers:

* Controller for messages - `TelegramBaseController`
* Controller for CallbackQueries - `TelegramBaseCallbackQueryController`
* Controller for InlineQueries - `TelegramBaseInlineQueryController`


## TelegramBaseController

To create controller for message updates you must extend `TelegramBaseController`.

If you want specific methods of your controller be called for specific commands, you should return a plain object in `routes` property where key is a route and value is name of your method.
In that case `handle` method will not be called and scope will be passed to your method.
Example:

```js
class TestController extends TelegramBaseController {
    get routes() {
        return {
            'test': 'testHandler'
        }
    }
}
```

If there are no routes defined then `handle` method of your controller will be called.

There is also `before` method, this method will be called after all updates and you should return the scope, you can modify scope if you want:

```js
class TestController extends TelegramBaseController {
    before(scope) {
        scope.someData = true

        return scope
    }
}
```
Remember: if you want to handle command in controller you need to declare it in router.

All instances of TelegramBaseController also have private `_api` property which is a reference to `TelegramApi` and private `_localization` property which is a reference to `Ivan`

## TelegramBaseCallbackQueryController

To create such controller you must extend TelegramBaseCallbackQueryController.

This controllers are very simple, they have only one method - `handle`, this method will be called for all queries and instance of `CallbackQuery` will be passed.

## TelegramBaseInlineQueryController

To create such controller you must extend TelegramBaseInlineQueryController.

These controllers also have `handle` method which will be called for all queries and an instance of `InlineScope` will be passed.
Also they its have `chosenResult` method which will be called when user select some result, an instance of `ChosenInlineResult`

Also as the `TelegramBaseController` it has `_api` and `_localization` properties.

## Getting updates
You can use long-pooling or webhooks to get updates.
Long-pooling used by default. To use webhooks you need to init library like this:
```js
const tg = new Telegram.Telegram('YOUR_TOKEN', {
    webhook: {
        url: 'https://61f66256.ngrok.io',
        port: 3000,
        host: 'localhost'
    }
})
```
You can also create any other custom update fetcher: just extend Telegram.BaseUpdateFetcher and pass it to library:
```js
const tg = new Telegram.Telegram('YOUR_TOKEN', {
    updateFetcher: new MyUpdateFetcher()
})
```


## Clustering
By default library will create one worker per cpu. You can change it like this:

```js
const tg = new Telegram.Telegram('YOUR_TOKEN', {
    workers: 1
})
```

If you want run some code on main process use `tg.onMaster` method:

```js
const tg = new Telegram.Telegram('YOUR_TOKEN', {
    workers: 1
})

tg.sendMessage(123, 'test message') //will be sent 2 times (one time on master and one time on worker)

tg.onMaster(() => {
    tg.sendMessage(123, 'test message') //will be sent one time
})
```

## Web admin
By default library will start web admin at localhost:7777, to change that use `webAdmin` properpty:
```js
const tg = new Telegram.Telegram('YOUR_TOKEN', {
    webAdmin: {
        port: 1234,
        host: 'localhost'
    }
})
```

## API
You can call api methods two ways:

Directly from tg:

```js
tg.api.sendMessage(chatId, 'Hi')
```

Or if you using controllers controller will pass you context `$` that already knows current chat id, so it's more easy to use:

```js
$.sendMessage('Hi')
```

All methods have required parameters and optional parameters, you can find them in  [api documentation](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#available-methods)
If you want to pass optional parameters you should pass them as an object:
```js
$.sendMessage('Hi', { disable_notification: true })
```

## Scope

There is two types of scope:

* scope for message controllers - `Scope`
* scope for inline mode controller - `InlineScope`

Message controllers scope:

scope will be passed to `handle` method or to your methods defined in `routes`

Main feature of scope is that scope already knows current chat id, so there is no need to pass that parameter.
Scope have all api methods that have chatId as their first parameter already filled.

Scope also contains some information about update.


Inline controllers scope also has all api methods filled with userId.

## Forms

In message controllers scope has `runForm` method.

With `$.runForm` method you can create forms:

```js
const form = {
    name: {
	    q: 'Send me your name',
	    error: 'sorry, wrong input',
	    validator: (message, callback) => {
		    if(message.text) {
			    callback(true, message.text) //you must pass the result also
			    return
		    }

		    callback(false)
	    }
    },
    age: {
	    q: 'Send me your age',
	    error: 'sorry, wrong input',
	    validator: (message, callback) => {
		    if(message.text && IsNumeric(message.text)) {
			    callback(true, toInt(message.text))
			    return
		    }

		    callback(false)
	    }
    }
}

$.runForm(form, (result) => {
	console.log(result)
})
```

Bot will send the 'q' message to user, wait for message, validate it with your validator function and save the answer, if validation fails bot will ask again that question.
You can also do some filtering in your validator, so you can pass the result as second parameter to callback.
You can also pass keyboard to `keyboard` field.

## Menu

You can create menu with $.runMenu function:

```js
$.runMenu({
    message: 'Select:',
    options: {
        parse_mode: 'Markdown' // in options field you can pass some additional data, like parse_mode
    },
    'Exit': {
	    message: 'Do you realy want to exit?',
	    resizeKeyboard: true,
	    'yes': () => {

	    },
	    'no': () => {

	    }
    },
    'anyMatch': () => { //will be executed at any other message

    }
})
```

Bot will create keyboard and send it with your message, when user tap button bot will call its callback, if it's submenu bot will send submenu.

Layouting menu:

You can pass the maximum number of buttons in line like this:

```js
$.runMenu({
    message: 'Select:',
    layout: 2,
    'test1': () => {}, //will be on first line
    'test2': () => {}, //will be on first line
    'test3': () => {}, //will be on second line
    'test4': () => {}, //will be on second line
    'test5': () => {}, //will be on third line
})
```
Or you can pass an array of number of buttons for each line:

```js
$.runMenu({
    message: 'Select:',
    layout: [1, 2, 1, 1],
    'test1': () => {}, //will be on first line
    'test2': () => {}, //will be on second line
    'test3': () => {}, //will be on second line
    'test4': () => {}, //will be on third line
    'test5': () => {}, //will be on fourth line
})
```

## Inline Menu

You can create inline menu using $.runInlineMenu:

```js
$.runInlineMenu({
    layout: 2, //some layouting here
    method: 'sendMessage', //here you must pass the method name
    params: ['text'], //here you must pass the parameters for that method
    menu: [
        {
            text: '1', //text of the button
            callback: (callbackQuery, message) => { //to your callback will be passed callbackQuery and response from method
                console.log(1)
            }
        },
        {
            text: 'Exit',
            message: 'Are you sure?',
            layout: 2,
            menu: [ //Sub menu (current message will be edited)
                {
                    text: 'Yes!',
                    callback: () => {

                    }
                },
                {
                    text: 'No!',
                    callback: () => {

                    }
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
})
```

## waitForRequest

Messages controller scope has `waitForRequest` method after calling that the next update from current user will be passed to promise.

## waitForCallbackQuery

If you send some inline keyboard after that you can call this method, pass to it string or array of string with callback data or your InlineKeyboardMarkup and then when user press button CallbackQuery will be passed to Promise

```js
$.sendMessage('Send me your name')
$.waitForRequest
    .then($ => {
        $.sendMessage(`Hi ${$.message.text}!`)
    })
```
## Sessions

For user:

```js
$.setUserSession('someKey', 'some data')
    .then(() => {
        return $.getUserSession('someKey')
    })
    .then(data => {
        console.log(data)
    })
```

For chat:

```js
$.setChatSession('someKey', 'some data')
    .then(() => {
        return $.getChatSession('someKey')
    })
    .then(data => {
        console.log(data)
    })
```


By default sessions are stored in memory, but you can store them anywhere, you need to extend `BaseStorage` and pass instance of your storage to `Telegram`:

```js
const tg = new Telegram.Telegram('YOUR_TOKEN',{
    storage: new MyStorage()
})
```

## Logging

Module makes some logs during work, by default logs are written to console, but you can create your own logger if you want, you must extend `BaseLogger` and pass instance of your logger to `Telegram`:

```js
const tg = new Telegram.Telegram('YOUR_TOKEN', {
    logger: new MyLogger()
})
```

## Localization

To use localization you need to pass your localization files to `Telegram`, they must be like this:

```js
{
  ""lang"": ""Ru"",
  ""phrases"": {
    ""startMessage"": ""тест""
  }
}
```

after creating your files you need to pass them to `Telegram`:

```js
const tg = new Telegram.Telegram('YOUR_TOKEN', {
    localization: [require('./Ru.json')]
})
```

Now you can use them in controllers like this:
```js
console.log(this._localization.Ru.startMessage)
```

You can even set the language for specific user:
```js
this._localization.setLanguageForUser(123456, 'Ru')
```

Or get phrases for user:
```js
this._localization.forUser(123456)
```

## Scope extensions:

Lets say you have some function that you want to be in scope, now you can do that like this:


```js
'use strict'

const Telegram = require('telegram-node-bot')
const TelegramBaseController = Telegram.TelegramBaseController
const BaseScopeExtension = Telegram.BaseScopeExtension
const tg = new Telegram.Telegram('YOUR_TOKEN')

class SumScopeExtension extends BaseScopeExtension {
    process(num1, num2) {
        return num1 + num2
    }

    get name() {
        return 'sum'
    }
}

class SumController extends TelegramBaseController {
    /**
     * @param {Scope} $
     */
    sumHandler($) {
        $.sendMessage($.sum($.query.num1, $.query.num2))
    }

    get routes() {
        return {
            '/sum :num1 :num2': 'sumHandler'
        }
    }
}

tg.router
    .when(['/sum :num1 :num2'], new SumController())

tg.addScopeExtension(SumScopeExtension)
```

## Sending files

From file id:

```js
$.sendPhoto(InputFile.byId('ID')) or $.sendPhoto('ID')
```

From url:

```js
$.sendPhoto(InputFile.byUrl('URL', 'image.jpg')) or $.sendPhoto({ url: 'URL', filename: 'image.jpg'})
```

By path:

```js
$.sendPhoto(InputFile.byFilePath('path/to/file')) or $.sendPhoto({ path: 'path/to/file'})
```

### 3. Getting Google OAuth API credential file and token.pickle
- Visit the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials)
- Go to the OAuth Consent tab, fill it, and save.
- Go to the Credentials tab and click Create Credentials -> OAuth Client ID
- Choose Desktop and Create.
- Publish your OAuth consent screen App to prevent **token.pickle** from expire
- Use the download button to download your credentials.
- Move that file to the root of mirrorbot, and rename it to **credentials.json**
- Visit [Google API page](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/library)
- Search for Drive and enable it if it is disabled
- Finally, run the script to generate **token.pickle** file for Google Drive:
```
pip install google-api-python-client google-auth-httplib2 google-auth-oauthlib
python3 generate_drive_token.py
```
------

## Deploying on VPS

**IMPORTANT NOTES**:
1. You must set `SERVER_PORT` variable to `80` or any other port you want to use.
2. To clear the container (this will not affect on the image):
```
sudo docker container prune
```
3. To delete the images:
```
sudo docker image prune -a
```
4. Check the number of processing units of your machine with `nproc` cmd and times it by 4, then edit `AsyncIOThreadsCount` in qBittorrent.conf.
5. Use `priiiiyo/mltb-oracle:latest` for oracle or if u faced problem with arm64 docker run.

## Using Service Accounts for uploading to avoid user rate limit
>For Service Account to work, you must set `USE_SERVICE_ACCOUNTS` = ""True"" in config file or environment variables.
>**NOTE**: Using Service Accounts is only recommended while uploading to a Team Drive.

### 1. Generate Service Accounts. [What is Service Account?](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-accounts)
Let us create only the Service Accounts that we need.

**Warning**: Abuse of this feature is not the aim of this project and we do **NOT** recommend that you make a lot of projects, just one project and 100 SAs allow you plenty of use, its also possible that over abuse might get your projects banned by Google.

>**NOTE**: If you have created SAs in past from this script, you can also just re download the keys by running:
```
python3 gen_sa_accounts.py --download-keys project_id
```
>**NOTE:** 1 Service Account can upload/copy around 750 GB a day, 1 project can make 100 Service Accounts so you can upload 75 TB a day or clone 2 TB from each file creator (uploader email).

#### Two methods to create service accounts
Choose one of these methods

##### 1. Create Service Accounts in existed Project (Recommended Method)
- List your projects ids
```
python3 gen_sa_accounts.py --list-projects
```
- Enable services automatically by this command
```
python3 gen_sa_accounts.py --enable-services $PROJECTID
```
- Create Sevice Accounts to current project
```
python3 gen_sa_accounts.py --create-sas $PROJECTID
```
- Download Sevice Accounts as accounts folder
```
python3 gen_sa_accounts.py --download-keys $PROJECTID
```

##### 2. Create Service Accounts in New Project
```
python3 gen_sa_accounts.py --quick-setup 1 --new-only
```
A folder named accounts will be created which will contain keys for the Service Accounts.

### 2. Add Service Accounts

#### Two methods to add service accounts
Choose one of these methods

##### 1. Add Them To Google Group then to Team Drive (Recommended)
- Mount accounts folder
```
cd accounts
```
- Grab emails form all accounts to emails.txt file that would be created in accounts folder
- `For Windows using PowerShell`
```
$emails = Get-ChildItem .\**.json |Get-Content -Raw |ConvertFrom-Json |Select -ExpandProperty client_email >>emails.txt
```
- `For Linux / MacOs`
```
grep -oPh '""client_email"": ""\K[^""]+' *.json > emails.txt
```
- Unmount acounts folder
```
cd ..
```
Then add emails from emails.txt to Google Group, after that add this Google Group to your Shared Drive and promote it to manager and delete email.txt file from accounts folder

##### 2. Add Them To Team Drive Directly
- Run:
```
python3 add_to_team_drive.py -d SharedTeamDriveSrcID
```
------

### Generate Database

**1. Using Railway**
- Go to [railway](https://railway.app) and create account
- Start new project
- Press on `Provision PostgreSQL`
- After creating database press on `PostgresSQL`
- Go to `Connect` column
- Copy `Postgres Connection URL` and fill `DATABASE_URL` variable with it

**2. Using Heroku PostgreSQL**
<p><a href=""https://dev.to/prisma/how-to-setup-a-free-postgresql-database-on-heroku-1dc1""> <img src=""https://img.shields.io/badge/See%20Dev.to-black?style=for-the-badge&logo=dev.to"" width=""160""""/></a></p>

**3. Using ElephantSQL**
- Go to [elephantsql](https://elephantsql.com) and create account
- Hit `Create New Instance`
- Follow the further instructions in the screen
- Hit `Select Region`
- Hit `Review`
- Hit `Create instance`
- Select your database name
- Copy your database url, and fill `DATABASE_URL` variable with it

------

## Multi Search IDs
To use list from multi TD/folder. Run driveid.py in your terminal and follow it. It will generate **drive_folder** file or u can simply create `drive_folder` file in working directory and fill it, check below format:
```
MyTdName folderID/tdID IndexLink(if available)
MyTdName2 folderID/tdID IndexLink(if available)
```
-----

## Yt-dlp and Aria2c Authentication Using .netrc File
For using your premium accounts in yt-dlp or for protected Index Links, create .netrc file according to following format:

**Note**: Create .netrc and not netrc, this file will be hidden, so view hidden files to edit it after creation.

Format:
```
machine host login username password my_password
```
Example:
```
machine instagram login anas.tayyar password mypassword
```
**Instagram Note**: You must login even if you want to download public posts and after first try you must confirm that this was you logged in from different ip(you can confirm from phone app).

**Youtube Note**: For `youtube` authentication use [cookies.txt](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl#how-do-i-pass-cookies-to-youtube-dl) file.

For Index Link with only password without username, even http auth will not work, so this is the solution.
```
machine example.workers.dev password index_password
```
Where host is the name of extractor (eg. instagram, Twitch). Multiple accounts of different hosts can be added each separated by a new line.

-----

## Gdtot Cookies
To Clone or Leech gdtot link follow these steps:
1. Login/Register to [gdtot](https://new.gdtot.top).
2. Copy this script and paste it in browser address bar.
   - **Note**: After pasting it check at the beginning of the script in broswer address bar if `javascript:` exists or not, if not so write it as shown below.
   ```
   javascript:(function () {
     const input = document.createElement('input');
     input.value = JSON.stringify({url : window.location.href, cookie : document.cookie});
     document.body.appendChild(input);
     input.focus();
     input.select();
     var result = document.execCommand('copy');
     document.body.removeChild(input);
     if(result)
       alert('Cookie copied to clipboard');
     else
       prompt('Failed to copy cookie. Manually copy below cookie\n\n', input.value);
   })();
   ```
   - After pressing enter your browser will prompt a alert.
3. Now you'll get this type of data in your clipboard
   ```
   {""url"":""https://new.gdtot.org/"",""cookie"":""PHPSESSID=k2xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxj63o; crypt=NGxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxWdSVT0%3D""}

   ```
4. From this you have to paste value of PHPSESSID and crypt in config.env file.

# Proxies
 *[IPRoyal](https://iproyal.com?r=18862) offers datacenter and residential proxies. The Royal Residential proxies have a large pool with addresses in over 160 countries all over the world, so they can generate a massive number of views. IPRoyal agreed to provide a huge discount for my script users, so the price will be as low as 0.60USD/GB! To get this incredible 80% discount for Royal Residential proxies, use the discount code: `youtubers80`*


* ## Free Proxy
   Try not to use free proxies. But if you have a paid subscription and you want to use authenticated IP feature, then you can use the free proxy category. Provide your text file path (where you saved the proxies) when the script asks for a proxy file name or a proxy API.
   N.B: Available for **http(s)/socks4/socks5**
   
* ## Premium Proxy
   Proxies with authentication can also be done. To do so put your proxies in this format `username:password@ipaddress:port`or `ipaddress:port:username:password` in a text file. Every single line will contain a single proxy. Provide your text file path when the script asks for a proxy file name or a proxy API.
   
   N.B: Only available for **http** type proxy.

* ## Rotating Proxy
   You can also use the rotating proxies service. You can either authenticate your IP on your proxy provider service and use `ipaddress:port` as Main Gateway. 
   N.B: Available for **http(s)/socks4/socks5**

   Or direct use username:password combo like this `username:password@ipaddress:port` or `ipaddress:port:username:password` as Main Gateway.

   N.B: Only available for **http** type proxy.
   You can use proxy API too.

# HTTP API
   Live logs fetched every 10 seconds and statistics in graphs are available on http://localhost:5000/ .Or [http://ip_of_your_pc:5000/](http://ip_of_your_pc:5000/) use this to access from another device under same network. A SQLite Database is being used  to store your generated views from this script. 
   Last 20 logs from scripts are fetched every 10 seconds to show on website and graph is updated every 5 minutes.

# Config.json
   No need to type everything everytime you run the script. A config file will be created automatically to save and use your preferences.
   
# Urls
  Put video links in the urls.txt. For multiple videos place urls in multple lines.
  1) To find video link in YouTube click share and copy.
  2) If you have any external link which will redirect to your youtube video you can use that too. Example : when you post a YouTube video link in **twitter** and you hit play on twitter, you will get a link like this `https://t.co/xxxxxxxxxx?amp=1`. This is helpful because YouTube will see that views are coming from External Source like twitter in this example.

# Search
  Program can search youtube with the keyword you want and find video with video title. To do this you need to know what keyword can find your video on youtube search engine. Also you need to provide **exact** video title. Put keyword and title like this format `keyword :::: video title` in **search.txt**. You can use same `video title` for multiple `keyword` too.

  *If you don't know any keyword just put your `video title :::: video title` in search.txt*

   
# Live Stream
   This script supports live streams too. Just use this script as you would for the already uploaded video. Script will automatically know if your video is live. Just bear in mind, you need a **high-end pc** for higher threads to get more viewers.
   Basically, script will check every 60 secs if youtube shows `x watching now` is present. If your live stream ends, script will check 5 times to be sure. In another word, after your live stream ends, script takes 5 minutes to close the driver.
   
   If you have never used this script before, use this first for an already uploaded video. This way, you will have a better understanding of how this script works. To do so, keep reading.

# YouTube Music
   Can generate views on YouTube Music too. In **urls.txt** put your music link like this `https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=xxxxx`. Script will automatically load YouTube Music when it sees link have `music.youtube.com`. **Search feature is not available for this.** So you need to empty the search.txt otherwise it will start searching videos in default YouTube.

# Windows
* ## Binary Release

  For windows you can download binary releases from **[Binary releases](https://github.com/MShawon/YouTube-Viewer/releases)**. Download this file named `YouTube-Viewer_win_x.x.x.zip`, unzip it and run the `youtube_viewer.exe`. Or you can install it from source. To do so keep reading. 
  
* ## Installation

  First, make sure you have installed git and Python version between 3.7.x to 3.9.x
  
  Open command prompt and type
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/MShawon/YouTube-Viewer.git
  ```
  ```
  cd YouTube-Viewer
  ```
  ```
  python -m pip install --upgrade pip
  ```
  ```
  pip install setuptools<59
  ```
  ```
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

* ## Important
   * If you've got a large proxy collection, you should run this command to filter Good proxies. Then use **GoodProxy.txt** for proxy in **youtube_viewer.py**
      ```
      python proxy_check.py
      ```

   * After closing program, if chromedrivers are still running. You may want to double click **killdrive.bat** to close all chrome instances.

   * *urls.txt* or *search.txt* can't be empty. Otherwise you will see errors. Use both for better results.

* ## Usage
   * Open command prompt in YouTube-Viewer folder and run
        ```
        python youtube_viewer.py
        ```
   * Rest is self explanatory.

# Linux / Mac
* ## Installation

  First, make sure you have installed git and Python version between 3.7.x to 3.9.x
  
  Open your favourite terminal and run
   ```
  git clone https://github.com/MShawon/YouTube-Viewer.git
  ```
  ```
  cd YouTube-Viewer
  ```
  ```
  python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
  ```
  ```
  pip3 install setuptools<59
  ```
  ```
  pip3 install -r requirements.txt
  ```

* ## Important
   * If you've got a large proxy collection, you should run this command to filter Good proxies. Then use **GoodProxy.txt** for proxy in **youtube_viewer.py**
        ```
        python3 proxy_check.py
        ```

   * After closing program, if chromedrivers are still running. Open your terminal and run 
      ```bash
      ps aux | awk '/chrome/ { print $2 } ' | xargs kill -9
      ```
   * *urls.txt* or *search.txt* can't be empty. Otherwise you will see errors. Use both for better results.

* ## Usage
   * Open command prompt in YouTube-Viewer folder and run
        ```
        python3 youtube_viewer.py
        ```
   * Rest is self explanatory.
 
 # Best Practices
  To get the most out of this script you should maintain these things.
  * Don't use HEADLESS mode. Because no IP leak prevention, fingerprint defending, etc. can be done in headless mode.
  * Youtube doesn't count views from the same IP after a certain time. Like, don't expect to get 100 views from 10 proxies. If you want more views, try to use a lot of premium proxies(free proxies are flagged by most websites). DO NOT use TOR proxies.
  * Use both [urls.txt](https://github.com/MShawon/YouTube-Viewer#urls) and [search.txt](https://github.com/MShawon/YouTube-Viewer#search)
  * And use as many [urls](https://github.com/MShawon/YouTube-Viewer#urls) and [keyword::::title](https://github.com/MShawon/YouTube-Viewer#search) as you can. Don't use just one video.

397,397,meepen/salien-bot,JavaScript,"# Salien Bot

Salien Bot is a WIP bot for the Salien Minigame that came out for the Steam Summer Sale 2018.

I picked this up because it reminded me of a challenge in programming I had before. I won't be manipulating any state, just injecting mouse clicks and other button presses.

Also, a note: playing this game AT ALL will not net you better rewards! It's only the time you have been on the page. There's no need to waste computer resources. :)


## Userscript Mode

Userscript Mode is a version of this bot that is ran as a script on top of your browser, while having a tab with the game open. It is generally easier to use.

Here are the steps to use: 

- Download and install the TamperMonkey addon for your browser of choice - https://tampermonkey.net/
- Open this link: https://github.com/meepen/salien-bot/raw/master/index.user.js with TamperMonkey installed; it should open up a tab that prompts you to install the script
- And finally, go to the Saliens game page!

It should be running now!

### Tile Selection

The tile select code, in this version, focuses on leveling up to level 13 on hard tiles; after you hit level 13 it will try and target the highest progress tile.


## Headless Mode

Headless Mode is a version of this game that is ran without a UI with the bot controlling it, in your command prompt / terminal / shell / etc.

Here are the steps to use: 

- Download and install nodejs - https://nodejs.org
- Download https://github.com/meepen/salien-bot/archive/master.zip
- Extract salien-bot-master.zip
- Open command line in salien-bot-master
- Write:
```
npm install
notepad gettoken.json
```
- Log into Steam
- Open https://steamcommunity.com/saliengame/gettoken in browser with Steam logged in
- Copy the entire contents of the page
- Paste into notepad and save the file as `gettoken.json`. 
- (IMPORTANT) Immediately copy something else to avoid accidentally giving this out to someone else!
- Save and exit
- Back to command line:
```
node headless
```

- (optional) See detailed bot options
```
node headless --help
```

It should be running now!

### Tile Selection

This version, by default, will scour all available planets and get the highest EXP rewards from difficult tiles; if you don't want this, run the bot with:
```
node headless --care-for-planet
```
This will make the bot only use the last planet which you were on and allows you to select the planet for the bot to focus on by first logging onto the Steam website and selecting a planet.

### Run the bot inside Docker

This bot can be ran inside a docker container in headless mode.

# Informer - Telegram Mass Surveillance

## Update 08-23-2021
* Updated to latest Telethon 1.23.0
* Fixed database issues by migrating to docker-compose
* Made Google Spreadsheets optional in setup
* Secure ENV files for setup
* Easier setup
* Replaced docker-compose in lieu of App Engine bc AE sux

## About
**Informer (TGInformer) is a bot library that allows you to masquerade as multiple REAL users on telegram** and spy on 500+ Telegram channels **per account**. Details are logged to a MySQL database, a private Google Sheet and your own private channel for analysis.

This is a functioning proof-of-concept project with known bugs. Feel free to fork, share and drop me a line.

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paulpierre/informer/master/github/screenshots/13.png)


## Potential Business Applications
* Sock puppeteering to overthrow a despotic regime
* Brand monitoring and sentiment analysis
* Shilling cryptocurrency at a moments notice for financial gain
* Influencing sentiment on topical issues
* Getting in on price action early
* Running analysis of a telegram channel


## Features
* Run all your bots in the cloud while you sleep. Support for Docker Compose

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paulpierre/informer/master/github/screenshots/14.png)

* Write all notifications to private Google Sheet

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paulpierre/informer/master/github/screenshots/9.png)

* Supports regular expressions for keyword filtering

* SQLAlchemy for agnostic data persistence

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paulpierre/informer/master/github/screenshots/8.png)

* Logging contextual message and channel data to a private channel and database

* Stores meta information about sender of message, channel, number of participants in the channel

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paulpierre/informer/master/github/screenshots/7.png)

* Auto-joins channels from CSV list containing Telegram channel URLs

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paulpierre/informer/master/github/screenshots/10.png)

* Persists session of channels joined

* Login once, bot stays logged in forever without needing 2FA re-authentication

* Join up to 500 channels per account

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paulpierre/informer/master/github/screenshots/4.png)

* Uses REAL accounts avoiding bot detection, **THIS IS NOT A TELEGRAM BOT** but a real automated user account. This is an important distinction because the official bot API is limited and bots are often restricted in public channels.


## Requirements
### OS / Infrastructure
* Python 3+
* Docker (optional)
* Telegram (Desktop, Web or Mobile download: https://www.telegram.org/)
* Burner app

### Python packages
* SQLAlchemy (1.3.11)
* sqlalchemy-migrate (0.13.0)
* Telethon (1.10.8)
* mysql-connector-python (8.0.18)
* gspread (3.1.0)
* oauth2client (4.1.3)

## Quick Start

### Setup your ENV vars
Edit the file informer.env which contains all the required environmental variables for informer

You can retrieve the necessary Telegram-related information here:

### Setup Your Telegram App

1. Head over to `http://my.telegram.com/auth` to authenticate your account by providing a phone number and the confirmation code sent to your phone number (or Telegram)
![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paulpierre/informer/master/github/screenshots/1-2.png)

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paulpierre/informer/master/github/screenshots/1-5.png)


2. Once you are authenticated, click on ""API Development Tools""
![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paulpierre/informer/master/github/screenshots/1-3.png)

3. Go ahead and create a New Application by filling out the form shown below
![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paulpierre/informer/master/github/screenshots/1-4.png)

4. You should now have the necessary parameter values for the `informer.env` file fields `TELEGRAM_API_HASH` and `TELEGRAM_API_APP_ID`

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paulpierre/informer/master/github/screenshots/1-6.png)

5. Go ahead and replace the values, including `TELEGRAM_ACCOUNT_PHONE_NUMBER` and move on to the next section

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paulpierre/informer/master/github/screenshots/1-7.png)

### Getting your Telegram ID

So far we have what we need for Telethon and Informer to access the Telegram APIs, next we need to acquire the indentifiers for your bot's account.

1. Open Telegram and search for the user `userinfobot`.

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paulpierre/informer/master/github/screenshots/2-1.png)

2. You will see multiple, make sure you select the correctly spelled account.

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paulpierre/informer/master/github/screenshots/2-2.png)

3. Click on the user and you should see a dialog option at the bottom that says ""Start"". Click on this.

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paulpierre/informer/master/github/screenshots/2-3.png)

4. The bot has a single purpose, to reflect back to you your current Telegram account's information.

You should receive your Telegram username and your Telegram account ID. This is important

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paulpierre/informer/master/github/screenshots/1-8.png)

5. Go ahead and edit the `informer.env` file and fill in the values for `TELEGRAM_ACCOUNT_ID` which
should be your Telegram account ID from the previous step and `TELEGRAM_ACCOUNT_USER_NAME`.

You can optionally fill in `TELEGRAM_NOTIFICATIONS_CHANNEL_ID` with your user name or a channel ID.

6. Make sure you have `TELEGRAM_ACCOUNT_PHONE_NUMBER` filled out as this is key to generating the session. For creating multiple accounts, please check out the Burner App below.

### Initialize and authenticate session

Make sure you are running python 3 and simply run `./quick_start.sh` in the directory.

You must run this first so that you can authenticate with Telegram on the first run and generate a local session file

You can later copy the files for the different accounts in app/session and mount them via Docker should you choose to do so.

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paulpierre/informer/master/github/screenshots/15.png)

You will be prompted to enter in the authentication code you received either via Telegram if you have logged in before, or via SMS

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paulpierre/informer/master/github/screenshots/1-5.png)

Hit enter and your session should be generated in the folder `app/session` with the file name as the international phone number you provided with a `.session` extension.

Continue to the next section where we use Docker Compose to setup a database.


### Setup a Notification Channel

This step is optional, but if you would like to create a private group channel and would like to acquire the group ID do the following:

* Create a group (or channel) and set it as private or public
* Be sure to get the Telegram URL
![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paulpierre/informer/master/github/screenshots/3-1.png)

Set the URL in the `informer.env` file under the parameter `TELEGRAM_NOTIFICATIONS_CHANNEL_URL`

To get the channel ID simply run `python3 bot.py <TELEGRAM_ACCOUNT_ID>` in the `app` directory where `<TELEGRAM_ACCOUNT_ID>` is the account ID you previously generated.

When the script loads, it will display all the channels you are in, simply copy this value and put it in the `TELEGRAM_NOTIFICATIONS_CHANNEL_ID` parameter of the `informer.env` file and kill the script. You're now ready to run Informer.


### Running Docker Compose
After running `quick_start.sh` you can run docker compose by:

* running `./start.sh` to build the Docker containers which include the MySQL database

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paulpierre/informer/master/github/screenshots/16.png)


* Run `./stop.sh` to stop the containers

* Run `./clean.sh` to remove an dangling containers and volumes. ** NOTE ** this will RESET the database and you will lose all your data.

A few things to note:

Before you were required to run your own MySQL instance and this created some issues with connection string compatability and versioning. In this update, it is just created for you and persisted on disk.

Additionally Dozzle is provided so that you may view logs in your browser, simply go to http://localhost:9999 and click on the `app_informer` container.


### Create a telegram account with Burner App

If you do not want to use your own phone number and want to run the Informer bot with some degree of anonymity you can use the Burner App available on iOS and Android.

1. Install the app Burner

	* Android - https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.thunderdog.challegram&hl=en_US
	* iOS - https://apps.apple.com/us/app/telegram-x/id898228810

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paulpierre/informer/master/github/screenshots/3.png)

2. Follow the same steps as above by providing the new phone number here:
 https://my.telegram.org/auth

3. Validate with Burner. You will be sent an authcode via SMS, you will need to provide

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paulpierre/informer/master/github/screenshots/1.png)

5. Log into Telegram

6.  Attempt to login with the app by running

`python3 bot.py <api_user_id>` in the `app` directory.

7. Since you are logging in with Telethon it will ask you for your authcode in the terminal like earlier.

This was  sent via Telegram message or SMS.

Provide this and it will save your session credentials in the session file mentioned below. You will no longer need to authenticate so long as you have the session file saved.

Sessions are saved in the `app/session/` folder as `<telegram_phone_number>.session`

Rinse and repeat until you have all the necessary session files and simply mount them in Docker.


## Scaling Telegram accounts
Figuring out how to scale accounts was a bit of a nightmare as I needed an automated process. Telegram requires you use a real phone number that can recieve texts from a shortcode.

Unfortunately services with APIs like Twilio are prohibited from receiving SMS from shortcodes in the US, Canada and UK https://support.twilio.com/hc/en-us/articles/223181668-Can-Twilio-numbers-receive-SMS-from-a-short-code- for fraud purposes. This would’ve been ideal, bahumbug.

A whole evening was wasted on this endeavor until I remembered a great app I used in the past: Burner (https://www.burnerapp.com/)  — which coincidentally does have an API (https://developer.burnerapp.com/api-documentation/incoming-webhooks/).  Meaning you can dynamically generate numbers, instantiate a new account and authenticate it all via Telegram’s client SDK in Python (Telethon: https://docs.telethon.dev/en/latest/)

The best part is Burner numbers are free for 14 days. Telegram accounts connected via client API need only login once and permanently persist sessions. I have not integrated with the Burner API, but the process is straight forward.


### Telethon SDK
The bot is built on top of the Telethon Python SDK (https://docs.telethon.dev/en/latest/)

A few things to note and gotchas encountered in building this proof of concept:

1. **Rate Limiting**
Telegram does intense rate limiting which will throw FloodWaitErrors. 
In my research it seems like no one knows the algorithm for this but 
you want your back off waits to scale in response because when you 
violate and exceed the unknown rate limit, the waits become 
exponential. I’ve found a happy medium with my approach to waiting.

FloodWaitErrors can occur when you are submitting too many requests 
to the API whether it is querying users information or joining  too many 
channels too fast

2. **Telethon Sessions**
Telethon will create a session file. You can set the name of the session 
file when you instantiate the Telethon client: 

`TelegramClient(<session_file_name>, <api_user_id>, <api_user_hash>)`

	This file happens to be a sqlite database which you can connect to. It 	
	acts like a cache and stores historical data as well as your session 
	authentication information so you will not have to re-authenticate with 
	Telegram’s 2FA . Note that you will need to login for a first time and 
	authenticate when you first use the API.

## Managing Multiple Bot Accounts

As the bot runs and joins channel, you will see your client update in real time and display the new channels you have joined.

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paulpierre/informer/master/github/screenshots/4.png)

TIP: TelegramX is by far the better client to use for these purposes as it supports multiple login. Download here:

* Android - https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.thunderdog.challegram&hl=en_US
* iOS - https://apps.apple.com/us/app/telegram-x/id898228810


## Google Sheets Integration
The python library gspread is used for managing io with Google Sheets. You will need to have a Google Cloud Platform account and enable Google Drive APIs. Afterwards you must generate server credentials with a json api key.

Instructions are here: https://www.twilio.com/blog/2017/02/an-easy-way-to-read-and-write-to-a-google-spreadsheet-in-python.html

This is optional.


## Known Bugs
* Currently a channel must have already been joined in order to begin monitoring of keywords. It is likely you will need to run the `bot.py` twice, once to let it join channels and another time to monitor them. I’m aware of this glaring bug and will fix it in the next revision.


## Todo
* Create user interface dashboard for bot management
	* Create new accounts
	* Add / remove channels
	* Add / remove keywords to monitor
	* View notifications 
	* Recieve web push notifications
* Automatically poll the database to update the keywords to monitor in memory
* Automate creation of phone numbers via Burner API and authcode process

# Proxies
 *[IPRoyal](https://iproyal.com?r=18862) offers datacenter and residential proxies. The Royal Residential proxies have a large pool with addresses in over 160 countries all over the world, so they can generate a massive number of views. IPRoyal agreed to provide a huge discount for my script users, so the price will be as low as 0.60USD/GB! To get this incredible 80% discount for Royal Residential proxies, use the discount code: `youtubers80`*


* ## Free Proxy
   Try not to use free proxies. But if you have a paid subscription and you want to use authenticated IP feature, then you can use the free proxy category. Provide your text file path (where you saved the proxies) when the script asks for a proxy file name or a proxy API.
   N.B: Available for **http(s)/socks4/socks5**
   
* ## Premium Proxy
   Proxies with authentication can also be done. To do so put your proxies in this format `username:password@ipaddress:port`or `ipaddress:port:username:password` in a text file. Every single line will contain a single proxy. Provide your text file path when the script asks for a proxy file name or a proxy API.
   
   N.B: Only available for **http** type proxy.

* ## Rotating Proxy
   You can also use the rotating proxies service. You can either authenticate your IP on your proxy provider service and use `ipaddress:port` as Main Gateway. 
   N.B: Available for **http(s)/socks4/socks5**

   Or direct use username:password combo like this `username:password@ipaddress:port` or `ipaddress:port:username:password` as Main Gateway.

   N.B: Only available for **http** type proxy.
   You can use proxy API too.

# HTTP API
   Live logs fetched every 10 seconds and statistics in graphs are available on http://localhost:5000/ .Or [http://ip_of_your_pc:5000/](http://ip_of_your_pc:5000/) use this to access from another device under same network. A SQLite Database is being used  to store your generated views from this script. 
   Last 20 logs from scripts are fetched every 10 seconds to show on website and graph is updated every 5 minutes.

# Config.json
   No need to type everything everytime you run the script. A config file will be created automatically to save and use your preferences.
   
# Urls
  Put video links in the urls.txt. For multiple videos place urls in multple lines.
  1) To find video link in YouTube click share and copy.
  2) If you have any external link which will redirect to your youtube video you can use that too. Example : when you post a YouTube video link in **twitter** and you hit play on twitter, you will get a link like this `https://t.co/xxxxxxxxxx?amp=1`. This is helpful because YouTube will see that views are coming from External Source like twitter in this example.

# Search
  Program can search youtube with the keyword you want and find video with video title. To do this you need to know what keyword can find your video on youtube search engine. Also you need to provide **exact** video title. Put keyword and title like this format `keyword :::: video title` in **search.txt**. You can use same `video title` for multiple `keyword` too.

  *If you don't know any keyword just put your `video title :::: video title` in search.txt*

   
# Live Stream
   This script supports live streams too. Just use this script as you would for the already uploaded video. Script will automatically know if your video is live. Just bear in mind, you need a **high-end pc** for higher threads to get more viewers.
   Basically, script will check every 60 secs if youtube shows `x watching now` is present. If your live stream ends, script will check 5 times to be sure. In another word, after your live stream ends, script takes 5 minutes to close the driver.
   
   If you have never used this script before, use this first for an already uploaded video. This way, you will have a better understanding of how this script works. To do so, keep reading.

# YouTube Music
   Can generate views on YouTube Music too. In **urls.txt** put your music link like this `https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=xxxxx`. Script will automatically load YouTube Music when it sees link have `music.youtube.com`. **Search feature is not available for this.** So you need to empty the search.txt otherwise it will start searching videos in default YouTube.

# Windows
* ## Binary Release

  For windows you can download binary releases from **[Binary releases](https://github.com/MShawon/YouTube-Viewer/releases)**. Download this file named `YouTube-Viewer_win_x.x.x.zip`, unzip it and run the `youtube_viewer.exe`. Or you can install it from source. To do so keep reading. 
  
* ## Installation

  First, make sure you have installed git and Python version between 3.7.x to 3.9.x
  
  Open command prompt and type
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/MShawon/YouTube-Viewer.git
  ```
  ```
  cd YouTube-Viewer
  ```
  ```
  python -m pip install --upgrade pip
  ```
  ```
  pip install setuptools<59
  ```
  ```
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

* ## Important
   * If you've got a large proxy collection, you should run this command to filter Good proxies. Then use **GoodProxy.txt** for proxy in **youtube_viewer.py**
      ```
      python proxy_check.py
      ```

   * After closing program, if chromedrivers are still running. You may want to double click **killdrive.bat** to close all chrome instances.

   * *urls.txt* or *search.txt* can't be empty. Otherwise you will see errors. Use both for better results.

* ## Usage
   * Open command prompt in YouTube-Viewer folder and run
        ```
        python youtube_viewer.py
        ```
   * Rest is self explanatory.

# Linux / Mac
* ## Installation

  First, make sure you have installed git and Python version between 3.7.x to 3.9.x
  
  Open your favourite terminal and run
   ```
  git clone https://github.com/MShawon/YouTube-Viewer.git
  ```
  ```
  cd YouTube-Viewer
  ```
  ```
  python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
  ```
  ```
  pip3 install setuptools<59
  ```
  ```
  pip3 install -r requirements.txt
  ```

* ## Important
   * If you've got a large proxy collection, you should run this command to filter Good proxies. Then use **GoodProxy.txt** for proxy in **youtube_viewer.py**
        ```
        python3 proxy_check.py
        ```

   * After closing program, if chromedrivers are still running. Open your terminal and run 
      ```bash
      ps aux | awk '/chrome/ { print $2 } ' | xargs kill -9
      ```
   * *urls.txt* or *search.txt* can't be empty. Otherwise you will see errors. Use both for better results.

* ## Usage
   * Open command prompt in YouTube-Viewer folder and run
        ```
        python3 youtube_viewer.py
        ```
   * Rest is self explanatory.
 
 # Best Practices
  To get the most out of this script you should maintain these things.
  * Don't use HEADLESS mode. Because no IP leak prevention, fingerprint defending, etc. can be done in headless mode.
  * Youtube doesn't count views from the same IP after a certain time. Like, don't expect to get 100 views from 10 proxies. If you want more views, try to use a lot of premium proxies(free proxies are flagged by most websites). DO NOT use TOR proxies.
  * Use both [urls.txt](https://github.com/MShawon/YouTube-Viewer#urls) and [search.txt](https://github.com/MShawon/YouTube-Viewer#search)
  * And use as many [urls](https://github.com/MShawon/YouTube-Viewer#urls) and [keyword::::title](https://github.com/MShawon/YouTube-Viewer#search) as you can. Don't use just one video.

403,403,tunitowen/fancy_bottom_navigation,Dart,"# FancyBottomNavigation

![Fancy Gif](https://github.com/tunitowen/fancy_bottom_navigation/blob/master/fancy_gif.gif ""Fancy Gif"")

## Getting Started

Add the plugin (pub coming soon):

```yaml
dependencies:
  ...
  fancy_bottom_navigation: ^0.3.2
```

## Limitations
For now this is limited to more than 1 tab, and less than 5. So 2-4 tabs.

## Basic Usage

Adding the widget
```dart
bottomNavigationBar: FancyBottomNavigation(
    tabs: [
        TabData(iconData: Icons.home, title: ""Home""),
        TabData(iconData: Icons.search, title: ""Search""),
        TabData(iconData: Icons.shopping_cart, title: ""Basket"")
    ],
    onTabChangedListener: (position) {
        setState(() {
        currentPage = position;
        });
    },
)
```

## TabData
**iconData** -> Icon to be used for the tab<br/>
**title** -> String to be used for the tab<br/>
**onClick** -> Optional function to be used when the circle itself is clicked, on an active tab

## Attributes
### required
**tabs** -> List of `TabData` objects<br/>
**onTabChangedListener** -> Function to handle a tap on a tab, receives `int position`

### optional
**initialSelection** -> Defaults to 0<br/>
**circleColor** -> Defaults to null, derives from `Theme`<br/>
**activeIconColor** -> Defaults to null, derives from `Theme`<br/>
**inactiveIconColor** -> Defaults to null, derives from `Theme`<br/>
**textColor** -> Defaults to null, derives from `Theme`<br/>
**barBackgroundColor** -> Defaults to null, derives from `Theme`<br/>
**key** -> Defaults to null<br/>

## Theming

The bar will attempt to use your current theme out of the box, however you may want to theme it. Here are the attributes:


![Fancy Theming](https://github.com/tunitowen/fancy_bottom_navigation/blob/master/fancy_theming.png ""Fancy Theming"")

## Programmatic Selection

To select a tab programmatically you will need to assign a GlobalKey to the widget. When you want to change tabs you will need to access the State using this key, and then call `setPage(position)`.<br/>
See example project, main.dart, line 75 for an example.

## Showcase
Using this package in a live app, let me know and I'll add you app here.


## Inspiration

This package was inspired by a design on dribbble by Manoj Rajput:<br/>
https://dribbble.com/shots/5419022-Tab

Do you need more help? Visit my server here: **https://discord.gg/DpxkY3x** 🍺

## Requirements
- Python 3.6 and up - https://www.python.org/downloads/
- git - https://git-scm.com/download/

## Useful to always have
Keep [this](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) saved somewhere, as this is the docs to discord.py@rewrite.
All you need to know about the library is defined inside here, even code that I don't use in this example is here.

## How to setup
1. Make a bot [here](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me) and grab the token
![Image_Example1](https://i.alexflipnote.dev/f9668b.png)

2. Rename the file **config.json.example** to **config.json**, then fill in the required spots, such as token, prefix and game

3. To install what you need, do **pip install -r requirements.txt**<br>
(If that doesn't work, do **python -m pip install -r requirements.txt**)<br>
`NOTE: Use pip install with Administrator/sudo`

4. Start the bot by having the cmd/terminal inside the bot folder and type **python index.py**

5. You're done, enjoy your bot!

## FAQ
Q: I don't see my bot on my server!<br>
A: Invite it by using this URL: https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=CLIENT_ID&scope=bot<br>
Remember to replace **CLIENT_ID** with your bot client ID

Q: There aren't that many commands here...<br>
A: Yes, I will only provide a few commands to get you started, maybe adding more later.

Q: Why the beer with the discord logo?<br>
A: Because the framework is made so simple that even a drunk guy can set it up.


# Optional tools
### Flake8
Flake8 is a tool that helps you keep your code clean. Most coding softwares will have a plugin that supports this Python module so it can be integrated with your IDE. To install it, simply do `pip install flake8`. If you're using python 3.7, install by doing `pip install -e git+https://gitlab.com/pycqa/flake8#egg=flake8`

### PM2
PM2 is an alternative script provided by NodeJS, which will reboot your bot whenever it crashes and keep it up with a nice status. You can install it by doing `npm install -g pm2` and you should be done. Keep in mind that this PM2 file is made to work on my own Linux instance, you might need to change the `interpreter` value.
```
# Start the bot
pm2 start pm2.json

# Tips on common commands
pm2 <command> [name]
  start discord_bot.py    Run the bot again if it's offline
  list                    Get a full list of all available services
  stop discord_bot.py     Stop the bot
  reboot discord_bot.py   Reboot the bot
```

### Docker
Docker is an alternative to run the bot 24/7 and always reboot again whenever it crashed. You can find the install manual [here](https://docs.docker.com/install/). You don't *have* to get it, but if you're used to having Docker, it's available at least.
```
# Build and run the Dockerfile
docker-compose up -d --build

# Tips on common commands
docker-compose <command>
  ps      Check if bot is online or not (list)
  down    Shut down the bot
  reboot  Reboot the bot without shutting it down or rebuilding
  logs    Check the logs made by the bot.
```

## Contributing

This bot manipulates tweets and streams by connecting to the
[Twitter API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs) via the `twit`
npm package. Please refer to the `twit`
[documentation](https://github.com/ttezel/twit) to make substantial
changes.

You can help by:

* Solving existing
  [issues](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/100DaysOfCode-twitter-bot/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue)
* Adding more functionalities to the bot
  ([see issues](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/100DaysOfCode-twitter-bot/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aenhancement))
* Pointing out bugs/errors

For any of the above, please create an issue so that it can be
addressed. New to GitHub issues? You can familiarize yourself with
them using GitHub's
[guide](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/).

#### Setup

* You will need your _own_ Twitter account for testing, since the bot
  tweets from this account. Generate your Twitter API keys by
  [creating a new app](https://apps.twitter.com/app/new).
* Fork this repository.
* Create an `.env` file and add in your API keys and Twitter handle,
  like so:

```
TWITTER_CONSUMER_KEY=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxdMhxg
TWITTER_CONSUMER_SECRET=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxkFNNj1H107PFv1mvWwEM6CZH0fjymV
TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN=xxxxxxxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxecKpi90bFhdsGG2N7iII
TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxZAU8wNKAPU8Qz2c0PhOo43cGO
QUERY_STRING=#someTestHashtag
TWITTER_USERNAME=YourTestTwitterAccountName
```

#### Make the Change

* Change any hashtags to
  [`#someTestHashtag`](https://twitter.com/search?q=someTestHashTag&src=typd)
  to avoid spamming the community hashtag.
* Run `npm/yarn test` to check all keys are available before you
  start. :+1:
* Make your suggested change.
* Ensure code style follows existing code (run `npm run format` to
  apply preferred formatting).
* Create a pull request.

407,407,bors-ng/bors-ng,Elixir,"A merge bot for GitHub pull requests
====================================

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/bors-ng/bors-ng)

[![Bors enabled](https://bors.tech/images/badge_small.svg)](https://app.bors.tech/repositories/3)

[Bors-NG] implements a continuous-testing workflow where the main branch never breaks.
It integrates GitHub pull requests with a tool like [Travis CI] that runs your tests.

Other resources:

* [Support forum](https://forum.bors.tech/)

# But don't GitHub's Protected Branches already do this?

Most CI systems, like Travis, Jenkins, and GitHub Actions both run the test suite
on every branch after it's pushed to and every pull request when it's opened, and
GitHub can block the pull requests if the tests fail on them. To understand why
this is insufficient to get an evergreen main branch, imagine this:

  * #### Pull Request \#1: Rename `bifurcate()` to `bifurcateCrab()`

    Change the name of this function, as well as every call site that currently
    exists in the main branch. I've thought of making it a method on Crab instead
    of on Sword, but then it would be `bifurcateWithSword()`, which hardly seems
    like an improvement.

  * #### Pull Request \#2: `bifurcate()` after landing, in addition to before

    Adds another call to `bifurcate()`, to make sure it gets done even if we
    skip the pre-landing procedure.

When both of these pull requests are sitting open in the backlog, they will
both be tested with the main branch. Assuming they both pass, GitHub will happily
present the Big Green Merge Button. Once they both get merged, the main branch
will go red (Method `bifurcate()` not found).

In addition to the testing requirements, GitHub can also be set to block pull
requests that are not ""up to date"" with the main branch, meaning that problems
like this can't show up. This fixes the problem, by requiring that the main branch
only contain a snapshot of the code that has passed the tests, but it requires
maintainers to manually:

 1. ""Update the pull requests,"" merging them onto main without changing
    main itself
 2. Wait for the test suite to finish
 3. Merge the pull request when it's done, which is a trivial operation that
    can't break the test suite thanks to step 1

And it has to be done for every pull request one at a time.

This is similar to, but less efficient than, the process that bors automates.
Instead of merging, you add reviewed pull requests to a ""merge queue"" of pull
requests that are tested against the main branch by copying it to a staging branch
and merging into that. When the status of staging is determined (either pass or fail),
bors reports the result back as a comment and merges staging into main if it was a pass.
Then it goes on to the next one.
Based on the assumption that the tests usually pass once they're r+-ed,
bors actually tests them in batches (and bisects if a batch fails).

Note that bors is not a replacement for your CI system. It just implements
this workflow.


# How it works

Bors is a [GitHub Application], so (assuming you already have GitHub Actions set up), getting bors set up requires three steps:

 1. Add the app to your repo in GitHub. [Click here to use the publicly hosted instance.](https://github.com/apps/bors/installations/new)
 2. Commit a bors.toml with these contents:

        status = [""ci""]
 
 3. Set up a workflow step with the same name. For example:

        ci-success:
          name: ci
          if: ${{ success() }}
          needs:
            - exfmt
            - test
          runs-on: ubuntu-latest
          steps:
            - name: CI succeeded
              run: exit 0

To use it, you need to stop clicking the big green merge button, and instead leave a comment with this in it on any pull request that looks good to you:

    bors r+

As commits are reviewed, bors lumps them into a queue of batches. If everything passes, there will just be two batches; the one that's running, and the one that's waiting to be run (and is accumulating more and more pull requests until it gets a chance to run).

To run a batch, bors creates a merge commit, merging the main branch with all the pull requests that make up the batch. Instead of pushing the merge commit immediately, however, it will instead push it to the `staging` branch. They'll look like this:

    Merge #5 #7 #8

    5: Rename `bifurcate()` to `bifurcateCrab()`
    7: Call `bifurcate()` in the `onland` event handler
    8: Fix crash in `drive()`

If the build passes, the main branch gets fast-forwarded to meet the staging branch. Since the main branch contains the exact contents that were just tested, bit-for-bit, it's not broken. (at least, not in any way that the automated tests are able to detect)

If the build fails, bors will follow a strategy called ""bisecting"". Namely, it splits the batch into two batches, and pushes those to the queue. In this example, the first batch will look like this:

    Merge #5 #7

    5: Rename `bifurcate()` to `bifurcateCrab()`
    7: Call `bifurcate()` in the `onland` event handler

This batch will still fail, because the second patch inserts a call to a function that the first patch removes. It will get bisected again, as a result.

The second will still pass, though.

    Merge #8

    8: Fix crash in `drive()`

This one will work, causing it to land in the main branch, leaving the first two still in the backlog.

    Merge #5

    5: Rename `bifurcate()` to `bifurcateCrab()`

This one will pass, since the PR it conflicts with (#7) is sitting behind it in the queue.

    Merge #7

    7: Call `bifurcate()` in the `onland` event handler

When a batch cannot be bisected (because it only contains one PR), it gets kicked back to the creator so they can fix it.

Note that you can watch this process running on the [dashboard page] if you want.

As a convenience, you can also run `bors try`, which will kick off a build the same way `r+` would, but without actually pushing it to the main branch even if it does succeed. To help keep them separate, `r+` merge commits go in `staging` and `try` builds go in `trying`.

The [original bors] used a more simple system (it just tested one PR at a time all the time).
The one-at-a-time strategy is O(N), where N is the total number of pull requests.
The batching strategy is O(E log N), where N is again the total number of pull requests and E is the number of pull requests that fail.

# How to run it on your local machine

If you're using a macOS or Linux command line with Docker on it,
`./script/setup && ./script/server` will set up a local instance,
with a mocked-out GitHub instance, using Docker to pull in all the underlying dependencies.
The web server ends up running on <http://localhost:8000/>.
You can get an Elixir REPL running in the same context as the webserver by running
`repl` instead of `server`. To run the tests, run `test` instead of `server`.

If you log in, it will log you in with the user ""space.""
There won't be any repositories, and space will not have admin perms.
You can use the [User model] to give space admin rights,
and the [WebhookController] and [GitHub ServerMock] to create the repo.

[User model]: https://bors-ng.github.io/devdocs/bors-ng/BorsNG.Database.User.html
[WebhookController]: https://bors-ng.github.io/devdocs/bors-ng/BorsNG.WebhookController.html
[GitHub ServerMock]: https://bors-ng.github.io/devdocs/bors-ng/BorsNG.GitHub.ServerMock.html

## Setting it up without Docker, like on Windows home edition

The main things you'll need to run Bors on your laptop are:

  * Familiarity with the command line
  * Elixir, with a full installation of OTP (the `esl-erlang` package is sufficient)
  * PostgreSQL; the configuration for it is in config/dev.exs
  * Stock C compilation tools, because some of bors's dependencies use NIFs
  * A git client, which you probably already have for downloading this repository
  * NodeJS, to perform asset compilation

I use [Portable PostgreSQL],
the [Chocolatey] packages for Elixir, Git, and NodeJS,
and the Visual C++ build tools from Microsoft.

[Portable PostgreSQL]: https://sourceforge.net/projects/postgresqlportable/
[Chocolatey]: https://chocolatey.org/packages/Elixir

You can then run it using `mix`:

    $ mix ecto.create
    $ mix ecto.migrate
    $ mix phx.server

And it'll run with the GitHub API mocked-out.

To run tests, run:

    $ mix test
    $ mix dogma
    $ mix dialyzer

# How to set up your own real instance

## Step 1: Register a new GitHub App

The first step is to [register a new Github App] on the GitHub web site.

[Register a new GitHub App]: https://github.com/settings/apps

### App settings

The *Github App name*, *description*, and *homepage URL* are irrelevant, though I suggest pointing the homepage at the dashboard page.

The *user authorization callback URL* should be at `<DASHBOARD URL>/auth/github/callback`.

Leave the *setup URL* blank.

The *webhook URL* should be at `<DASHBOARD URL>/webhook/github`.

The *webhook secret* should be a randomly generated string. The `mix phx.gen.secret` command will work awesomely for this. Keep this handy to specify the same value in the bors configuration (you can also edit this value later if you need to).

### Required GitHub App permissions

####  Permission summary

For each of these sections, set the following overall section permissions and check the following webhook event checkboxes. Explanations for why bors-ng needs each of these permissions are below.

- *Repository metadata*: Read-only (no choice)
  - *Repository* (Repository created, deleted, publicized, or privatized)
- *Repository administration*: No access
- *Commit statuses*: Read & write
  - *Status* (Commit status updated from the API)
- *Deployments*: No access
- *Issues*: Read & write
  - *Issue comment* (Issue comment created, edited, or deleted)
- *Pages*: No access
- *Pull requests*: Read & write
  - *Pull request* (Pull request opened, closed, reopened, edited, assigned, unassigned, review requested, review request removed, labeled, unlabeled, or synchronized)
  - *Pull request review* (Pull request review submitted, edited, or dismissed)
  - *Pull request review comment* (Pull request diff comment created, edited, or deleted)
- *Repository contents*: Read & write
  - (no checkboxes)
- *Single file*: No access
- *Repository projects*: No access
- *Organization members*: Read-only
  - *Team* (Team is created, deleted, edited, added to/removed from a repository)
  - *Member* (Collaborator added to, removed from, or has changed permissions for a repository)
  - *Membership* (Team membership added or removed)
  - *Organization* ( User invited to, added to, or removed from an organization)
- *Organization projects*: No access
- *Checks*: Read & Write
  - *Check run* (Check run created from the API)
  - *Check suite* (Check suite created from the API)

#### Permission explanations

*Repository metadata* will be read-only. Must be set to receive *Repository* events to automatically remove entries from our database when a repo is deleted.

*Commit statuses* must be set to *Read & write* to report a testing status (this is the older version). Also must get *Status* events to integrate with CI systems that report their status via GitHub.

*Issues* must be set to *Read & write* because pull requests are issues. *Issue comment* events must be enabled to get the ""bors r+"" comments. If *Issues* is set to Read-only, repos will end up with pull requests that are marked as simultaneously merged and opened.

*Pull requests* must be set to *Read & write* to be able to post pull request comments. Also, must receive *Pull request* events to be able to keep the dashboard working, and must get *Pull request review* and *Pull request review comment* events to get those kinds of comments.

*Repository contents* must be set to *Read & write* to be able to create merge commits.

*Checks* must be set to *Read & write* to report a testing status (this is the newer version). Also must get *Check run* events to integrate with CI systems that report their status via GitHub.

*Organization members* must be set to *Read only* to synchronize repository contributors and bors reviewers.

### After you click the ""Create"" button

GitHub will send a ""ping"" notification to your webhook endpoint. Since bors is not actually running yet, that will fail. This is expected.

You'll need the following values from your GitHub App for configuring bors-ng:

- Private key (generate one and download the file)
- OAuth credentials
- ID (appears beneath the app logo and ""Owned by"" in the right hand column)

### Internal app?

GitHub Apps can be set as ""Internal"" or ""External"".
When the App is set to be internal,
then whichever organization/user it belongs to will be the only one allowed to install it.

This setting can be chosen while first creating the app, or it can be changed afterward at one of these URLs (the switch is on the bottom of the page):

* If the app is owned by an organization: `https://github.com/organizations/<ORGANIZATION>/settings/apps/<APP NAME>/advanced`
* If the app is owned by a user: `https://github.com/settings/apps/<APP NAME>/advanced`

If an ""External"" app is installed on any external repositories,
then the ""Make Internal"" button will be grayed out.

## Step 2: Set up the server

bors-ng is written in the [Elixir] programming language,
and it uses [PostgreSQL] as the backend database.
Whatever machine you plan to run it on needs to have both of those installed.

[Elixir]: https://elixir-lang.org/
[PostgreSQL]: https://postgresql.org/
[docs on how to deploy phoenix apps]: https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/deployment.html

bors-ng is built on the Phoenix web framework, and they have [docs on how to deploy phoenix apps] already. Where you deploy will determine what the dashboard URL will be, which is needed in the previous steps, so this decision needs to be made before you can set up the Github App.

You'll need to edit the configuration with a few bors-specific variables.

### Deploying on [Heroku] (and other 12-factor-style systems)

[Heroku]: https://heroku.com/

The config file in the repository is already set up to pull the needed information from the environment, so you can configure bors by setting the right env variables and deploy the app from this repository into Heroku:

You can do using Heroku's one-button-deploy system:

[![Deploy on Heroku](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy)

Or you can do it manually:

**Note**: The `GITHUB_INTEGRATION_ID` is now called the App ID on GitHub.

    $ heroku create --buildpack ""https://github.com/HashNuke/heroku-buildpack-elixir.git"" bors-app
    $ heroku buildpacks:add https://github.com/gjaldon/heroku-buildpack-phoenix-static.git
    $ heroku addons:create heroku-postgresql:hobby-dev
    $ heroku config:set \
        MIX_ENV=prod \
        POOL_SIZE=18 \
        PUBLIC_HOST=bors-app.herokuapp.com \
        ALLOW_PRIVATE_REPOS=true \
        COMMAND_TRIGGER=bors \
        SECRET_KEY_BASE=<SECRET1> \
        GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=<OAUTH_CLIENT_ID> \
        GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=<OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET> \
        GITHUB_INTEGRATION_ID=<ISS> \
        GITHUB_INTEGRATION_PEM=`base64 -w0 priv.pem` \
        GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET=<SECRET2>
    $ git push heroku master
    $ heroku run 'POOL_SIZE=1 mix ecto.migrate'

*WARNING*: bors-ng stores some short-term state inside the `web` dyno (it uses a sleeping process to implement delays, specifically).
It can recover the information after restarting, but it will not work correctly with Heroku's replication system.
If you need more throughput than one dyno can provide, you should deploy using a system that allows Erlang clustering to work.


### Deploying using [Docker] (and compatible container orchestration systems)

[Docker]: https://docker.com/

Pre-built Docker images are available at [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/borsng/bors-ng/) for tags and the current `master` (as `bors-ng:latest`).

The Dockerfile in the project root can be used to build the image yourself.
It relies on [multi-stage builds](https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/eng-image/multistage-build/) as introduced in Docker 17.05,
to generate a slim image without the Erlang, Elixir and NodeJS development tools.

Most of the important configuration options should be set at runtime using environment variables, not unlike the Heroku instructions.
All the same recommendations apply, with some extra notes:

- `ELIXIR_VERSION` can be set as a build-time argument. Its default value is defined in the [Dockerfile](Dockerfile).
- `ALLOW_PRIVATE_REPOS` must be set at both build and run times to take effect. It is set to ` true` by default.
- `DATABASE_URL` *must* contain the database port, as it will be used at container startup to wait until the database is reachable. [The format is documented here](https://hexdocs.pm/ecto/Ecto.Repo.html#module-urls).
- `DATABASE_TIMEOUT` may be set higher than the default of `15_000`(ms). This may be necessary with repositories with a very large amount of members.
- `DATABASE_PREPARE_MODE` can be set to to `unnamed` to disable prepared statements, [which is necessary when using a transaction/statement pooler, like pgbouncer](https://github.com/elixir-ecto/postgrex#pgbouncer). It is set to `named` by default.
- The database schema will be automatically created and migrated at container startup, unless the ` DATABASE_AUTO_MIGRATE`  env. var.
  is set to `false`. Make that change if the database state is managed externally, or if you are using a database that cannot safely handle
  concurrent schema changes (such as older MariaDB/MySQL versions).
- Database migrations can be manually applied from a container using the `migrate` release command. Example:
  `docker run borsng/bors-ng:latest /app/bors/bin/bors migrate`.
  Unfortunately other `mix` tasks are not available, as they cannot be run from compiled releases.
- The `PORT` environment variable is set to `4000` by default.
- `GITHUB_URL_ROOT_API` and `GITHUB_URL_ROOT_HTML` should allow you to connect bors-ng to an instance of GitHub Enterprise.
  Note: I've never actually used GitHub Enterprise, so I'm kinda guessing about what you'd need here.

      docker create --name bors --restart=unless-stopped \
          -e PUBLIC_HOST=app.bors.tech \
          -e SECRET_KEY_BASE=<secret> \
          -e GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=<secret> \
          -e GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=<secret> \
          -e GITHUB_INTEGRATION_ID=<secret> \
          -e GITHUB_INTEGRATION_PEM=<secret> \
          -e GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET=<secret> \
          -e DATABASE_URL=""postgresql://postgres:<secret>@db:5432/bors_ng"" \
          -e DATABASE_USE_SSL=false \
          -e DATABASE_AUTO_MIGRATE=true \
          -e COMMAND_TRIGGER=bors \
          borsng/bors-ng
      docker start bors

### Deploying on your own cluster

Your configuration can be done by modifying `config/prod.secret.exs`.

## Optional step 3: make yourself an admin

bors-ng offers a number of special functions for ""administrator"" users, including diagnostics and the ability to open a repo dashboard without being a reviewer.

However, there's no UI for adding admins; you'll have to go into Postgres yourself to do it. There's two ways to do that:

You can do it from the iex prompt, like this:

    shell$ iex -S mix # or `heroku run bash -c ""POOL_SIZE=1 iex -S mix""`
    iex> me = BorsNG.Database.Repo.get_by! BorsNG.Database.User, login: ""<your login>""
    iex> BorsNG.Database.Repo.update! BorsNG.Database.User.changeset(me, %{is_admin: true})

You can do it from a PostgreSQL prompt like this:

    postgres=# \c bors_dev -- or bors_prod
    bors_dev=# update users set is_admin = true where login = '<your login>';

"
408,408,microsoft/HealthBotContainerSample,JavaScript,"# Health Bot Container

A simple web page that allows users to communicate with the [Azure Health Bot](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/bot-services/health-bot/) through a WebChat.

**Note:** In order to use this Web Chat with the Health Bot service, you will need to obtain your Web Chat secret by going to `Integration/Secrets` on the navigation panel.

![Secrets](/secrets.png)

1.Deploy the website:

[![Deploy to Azure](https://aka.ms/deploytoazurebutton)](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fmicrosoft%2FHealthBotContainerSample%2Fmaster%2Fazuredeploy.json)

2.Set the following environment variables:

`APP_SECRET`

`WEBCHAT_SECRET`

3.Configure scenario invocation (optional):

The Health Bot service uses [language models](https://docs.microsoft.com/HealthBot/language_model_howto) to interpret end user utterances and trigger the relevant scenario logic in response.

Alternatively, you can programmaticaly invoke a scenario before the end user provides any input.

To implement this behavior, uncomment the following code from the `function initBotConversation()` in the `/public/index.js` file:
```javascript
triggeredScenario: {
    trigger: ""{scenario_id}"",
    args: {
        myVar1: ""{custom_arg_1}"",
        myVar2: ""{custom_arg_2}""
    }
}
```
Replace {scenario_id} with the scenario ID of the scenario you would like to invoke.
You can also pass different values through the ""args"" object. 

You can read more about programmatic client side scenario invocation [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/HealthBot/integrations/programmatic_invocation)


4.Set the Bot service direct line channel endpoint (optional)

In some cases it is required to set the endpoint URI so that it points to a specific geography. The geographies supported by the bot service each have a unique direct line endpoint URI:

- `directline.botframework.com` routes your client to the nearest datacenter. This is the best option if you do not know where your client is located.
- `asia.directline.botframework.com` routes only to Direct Line servers in Eastern Asia.
- `europe.directline.botframework.com` routes only to Direct Line servers in Europe.
- `northamerica.directline.botframework.com` routes only to Direct Line servers in North America.

Pass your preferred geographic endpoint URI by setting the environment variable: `DIRECTLINE_ENDPOINT_URI` in your deployment. If no variable is found it will default to `directline.botframework.com`

**Note:** If you are deploying the code sample using the ""Deploy to Azure"" option, you should add the above secrets to the application settings for your App Service.

## Agent webchat
If the agent webchat sample is also required, [switch to the live agent handoff branch](https://github.com/Microsoft/HealthBotContainerSample/tree/live_agent_handoff)

"
410,410,cheran-senthil/TLE,Python,"# TLE

TLE is a Discord bot centered around Competitive Programming.

## Features

The features of the bot are split into a number of cogs, each handling their own set of commands.

### Codeforces cogs

- **Codeforces** Commands that can recommend problems or contests to users, taking their rating into account.
- **Contests** Shows details of upcoming/running contests.
- **Graphs** Plots various data gathered from Codeforces, e.g. rating distributions and user problem statistics.
- **Handles** Gets or sets information about a specific user's Codeforces handle, or shows a list of Codeforces handles.

### CSES cog

- **CSES** Commands related to the [CSES problemset](https://cses.fi/problemset/), such as showing leaderboards.

### Other cogs

- **Starboard** Commands related to the starboard, which adds messages to a specific channel when enough users react with a ⭐️.
- **CacheControl** Commands related to data caching.

## Installation
> If you want to run the bot inside a docker container follow these [instructions](/Docker.md)

Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cheran-senthil/TLE
```

### Dependencies

Now all dependencies need to be installed. TLE uses [Poetry](https://poetry.eustace.io/) to manage its python dependencies. After installing Poetry navigate to the root of the repo and run

```bash
poetry install
```

> :warning: **TLE requires Python 3.7 or later!**

If you are using Ubuntu with older versions of python, then do the following:

```bash
apt-get install python3.7-venv libpython3.7-dev
python3.7 -m pip install poetry
python3.7 -m poetry install
```

---

#### Library dependencies

TLE also depends on cairo and pango for graphics and text rendering, which you need to install. For Ubuntu, the relevant packages can be installed with:

```bash
apt-get install libcairo2-dev libgirepository1.0-dev libpango1.0-dev pkg-config python3-dev gir1.2-pango-1.0
```

Additionally TLE uses pillow for graphics, which requires the following packages:

```bash
apt-get install libjpeg-dev zlib1g-dev
```

### Final steps

You will need to setup a bot on your server before continuing, follow the directions [here](https://github.com/reactiflux/discord-irc/wiki/Creating-a-discord-bot-&-getting-a-token). Following this, you should have your bot appearing in your server and you should have the Discord bot token. Finally, go to the `Bot` settings in your App's Developer Portal (in the same page where you copied your Bot Token) and enable the `Server Members Intent`.

Create a new file `environment`.

```bash
cp environment.template environment
```

Fill in appropriate variables in new ""environment"" file.

#### Environment Variables

- **BOT_TOKEN**: the Discord Bot Token for your bot.
- **LOGGING_COG_CHANNEL_ID**: the [Discord Channel ID](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/206346498-Where-can-I-find-my-User-Server-Message-ID-) of a Discord Channel where you want error messages sent to.
- **ALLOW_DUEL_SELF_REGISTER**: boolean value indicating if self registration for duels is enabled.
- **TLE_ADMIN**: the name of the role that can run admin commands of the bot. If this is not set, the role name will default to ""Admin"".
- **TLE_MODERATOR**: the name of the role that can run moderator commands of the bot. If this is not set, the role name will default to ""Moderator"".

To start TLE just run:

```bash
./run.sh
```

### Notes

- In order to run admin-only commands, you need to have the `Admin` role, which needs to be created in your Discord server and assign it to yourself/other administrators.
- In order to prevent the bot suggesting an author's problems to the author, a python file needs to be run (since this can not be done through the Codeforces API) which will save the authors for specific contests to a file. To do this run `python extra/scrape_cf_contest_writers.py` which will generate a JSON file that should be placed in the `data/misc/` folder.
- In order to display CJK (East Asian) characters for usernames, we need appropriate fonts. Their size is ~36MB, so we don't keep in the repo itself and it is gitignored. They will be downloaded automatically when the bot is run if not already present.
- One of the bot's features is to assign roles to users based on their rating on Codeforces. In order for this functionality to work properly, the following roles need to exist in your Discord server
  - Newbie
  - Pupil
  - Specialist
  - Expert
  - Candidate Master
  - Master
  - International Master
  - Grandmaster
  - International Grandmaster
  - Legendary Grandmaster
- One of the bot's commands require problemsets to be cached. Run `;cache problemsets all` at the very first time the bot is used. The command may take around 10 minutes to run.

## Usage

In order to run bot commands you can either ping the bot at the beginning of the command or prefix the command with a semicolon (;), e.g. `;handle pretty`.

In order to find available commands, you can run `;help` which will bring a list of commands/groups of commands which are available. To get more details about a specific command you can type `;help <command-name>`.

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome. For major changes please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

Before submitting your PR, consider running some code formatter on the lines you touched or added. This will help reduce the time spent on fixing small styling issues in code review. Good options are [yapf](https://github.com/google/yapf) or [autopep8](https://github.com/hhatto/autopep8) which likely can be integrated into your favorite editor.

Please refrain from formatting the whole file if you just change some small part of it. If you feel the need to tidy up some particularly egregious code, then do that in a separate PR.

411,411,WhiteHouse/fb_messenger_bot,PHP,"# Features

This Drupal module provides a tool to build a chat bot to work on Facebook's Messenger
Platform.

## Requirements

- Drupal 8
- PHP 5.6 or greater
- Facebook App and Page

## Installation

 1. Enable the fb_messenger_bot module.
 2. Visit /admin/config/fb-messenger and enter a custom value for the Facebook
    Verify Token (save the configuration).
 3. Complete steps 1-4 outlined in [Facebook's quickstart documentation](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/quickstart)
    including the copying of the page access token in step 3 (note: this module sets up the webhook at /webhook/contact).
 4. Return to /admin/config/fb-messenger and paste the page access token into
    the Facebook Page Access Token field (save the configuration).
 5. Clear caches.
 6. Visit the Facebook page your app is subscribed to and send it a message.
    You should receive a response from the bot!

## Customizing your bot

 *Note:* You can use the demo_fb_messenger_bot folder as a starting point or
 reference.
 1. In a custom module, create a custom workflow by creating a class that
    extends the FBMessengerBotWorkflow class.
 2. Modify the fb_messenger_bot.workflow service to use your custom workflow by
    creating a class that extends ServiceProviderBase and implements the alter()
    method ([documentation from d.o.](https://www.drupal.org/node/2026959)).

### Supported message types

As of right now, this module can handle sending text, button, generic, and video
messages from [Facebook's Send API](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/product-overview/conversation#send_messages).

#### Text message

```
$textMessage =  new TextMessage('Text Message!');
```

#### Button message

```
$buttonMessage = new ButtonMessage(
  array(
    new PostbackButton('Next Step', 'buttonMessage_Next'),
    new UrlButton('URL Button', 'http://www.example.com');
  )
);
```

#### Video message
```
$videoMessage = new VideoMessage('http://techslides.com/demos/sample-videos/small.mp4');
```

### Steps

The meat of a workflow resides in its steps. Each step is an object responsible
for providing the workflow with a human readable name (see Roadmap), machine
name, and message(s) to send the user. In addition to those basics, steps need
to indicate what the next step to go to in the workflow based on a user's
response. Lastly, steps should provide a validation callback which will be
invoked to validate the user's response to the step, as well as an invalid
response message, which will be sent to the user in the event that the callback
returns false.

#### Instantiating a step in your workflow

```
$stepHumanReadableName
$stepMachineName
$messageToSend = array(new TextMessage('Hi there!'));

// Set step welcoming user to conversation.
$welcomeStep = new BotWorkflowStep($humanReadableName, $stepMachineName, $messageToSend);
```
#### Adding response handlers

As mentioned above, every step needs to indicate the next step to go to based on
a user's response to that step. This is achieved with response handlers.

```
$welcomeStep->setResponseHandlers(
  array(
    '*' => array(
      'handlerMessage' => NULL,
      'goto' => 'builtABot',
    ),
  )
);
```

In the example above, we indicate that regardless of what the user sends us (the
asterisk), we want to proceed to the step in the workflow with machine name
'builtABot'. By indicating 'NULL' for the handlerMessage, we are saying we want
to send whatever message text is configured in the builtABot step. If we want to
override that behavior, we can simply set the handlerMessage value to be an
array of messages(s) of type MessageInterface.

If you sent out a message with buttons, and want to route a user to different
steps depending on which button they clicked, you would achieve that using
response handlers:

```
$builtStep = new BotWorkflowStep('Built A Bot', 'builtABot',
  new ButtonMessage('Glad you stopped by for a chat. Have you ever built a chat bot?',
    array(
      new PostbackButton('Yep!', 'builtABot_Yes'),
      new PostbackButton(""Nope!"", 'builtABot_No'),
    )
  )
);

$builtStep->setResponseHandlers(
  array(
    'builtABot_Yes' => array(
      'handlerMessage' => NULL,
      'goto' => 'veteranBuilder',
    ),
    'builtABot_No' => array(
      'handlerMessage' => NULL,
      'goto' => 'neverBuilt',
    ),
  )
);
```

#### Step validation

Often times, you'll want to collect some sort of information from the user that
requires validation prior to saving it. The module ships with a few validation
callbacks you can use, but you're free to override them, and/or
implement your own. These include:
- text message (ensure the user sent text)
- postback (ensure the user clicked one of the buttons you sent them)
- zip code
- e-mail
- phone number (U.S.)

```
$validationFunction = $this->getTextMessageValidatorFunction();
$invalidResponse = $this->getGenericValidationFailMessage();
$welcomeStep->setValidationCallback($validationFunction);
$welcomeStep->setInvalidResponseMessage($invalidResponse);
```

## Roadmap

### Documentation Improvements

Add documentation on:
- starting over a conversation
- fetching and storing a user's info from Facebook
- pre and post conversation process methods
- handling trolling users

### Enhancements and hopes

We'd love to:
- Refactor as much of the code as possible to be usable in a general
PHP context, outside of Drupal.
- Convert objects to be Drupal entities where appropriate. Refactoring steps
to being config entities, for example, would allow for configuration of steps by
an admin.
- Support multiple workflows (e.g. you could have a intro workflow with
certain steps and then transition a user to a gather contact info workflow with
a different set of steps etc.)
- See you all fork and contribute to the module! (It would be great to see
someone from the community polish the code and contribute it to [drupal.org](drupal.org)).

# Zenbot [![Build/Test Status](https://travis-ci.org/DeviaVir/zenbot.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/DeviaVir/zenbot) 

## Description

Zenbot is a command-line cryptocurrency trading bot using Node.js and MongoDB. It features:

- Fully-automated [technical-analysis](https://stockcharts.com/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:technical_indicators:introduction_to_technical_indicators_and_oscillators)-based trading approach
- Full support for [Binance](https://www.binance.com/), [Bitfinex](https://www.bitfinex.com/), [Bitstamp](https://www.bitstamp.net/), [Bittrex](https://bittrex.com/), [CEX.IO](https://cex.io/), [GDAX](https://gdax.com/), [Gemini](https://gemini.com/), [HitBTC](https://hitbtc.com/), [Kraken](https://www.kraken.com/), [Poloniex](https://poloniex.com/)and [TheRockTrading](https://www.therocktrading.com/), work on further exchange support is ongoing.
- Plugin architecture for implementing exchange support, or writing new strategies
- Simulator for [backtesting strategies](https://gist.github.com/carlos8f/b09a734cf626ffb9bb3bcb1ca35f3db4) against historical data
- ""Paper"" trading mode, operates on a simulated balance while watching the live market
- Configurable sell stops, buy stops, and (trailing) profit stops
- Flexible sampling period and trade frequency - averages 1-2 trades/day with 1h period, 15-50/day with 5m period

## Disclaimer

- Zenbot is NOT a sure-fire profit machine. Use it AT YOUR OWN RISK.
- Crypto-currency is still an experiment, and therefore so is Zenbot. Meaning, both may fail at any time.
- Running a bot, and trading in general requires careful study of the risks and parameters involved. A wrong setting can cause you a major loss.
- Never leave the bot un-monitored for long periods of time. Zenbot doesn't know when to stop, so be prepared to stop it if too much loss occurs.
- Often times the default trade parameters will underperform vs. a buy-hold strategy, so run some simulations and find the optimal parameters for your chosen exchange/pair before going ""all-in"".

最近研究量化交易，学习了很好的一个项目：[Samaritan](https://github.com/miaolz123/samaritan)

可惜这个项目已经很久很久没有更新過了，另外项目中也有一些BUG，其中最致命的BUG就是在实现javascript并发任务这个功能的时候没有考虑资源冲突的处理，导致程序无法正常工作，所以对这些部分进行了一些修改，使其可以正常工作，并且更新了文档，另外原有的一些交易所接口也因为各种原因失效了，所以这里也重新更新了部分交易所接口，比如火币，比特儿国际，币安，OKEX等，并且更新了文档，然后给项目重新改了个更直观的名字。另外每个交易所的交易对只是选取了几个大币种的，如果需要添加新的交易对，可以修改源代码进行添加。还有就是某些交易所需要搭梯子，测试的时候请自行准备梯子，并修改对应交易所接口源码。

这里我写了个简单的搬砖演示程序：[代码](https://github.com/phonegapX/trader-sample) [博客](http://phonegap.me/post/52.html)

[更新的文档](http://www.quantbot.org/#/)

版本更新到v0.0.2，新增了中币交易所的接口。  
版本更新到v0.0.3，新增了BigONE交易所的接口，当前热门的 “交易挖矿+持币分红” 交易所。(2018-07-09)

## 编译

直接运行build.sh进行编译，需要用到xgo和Docker，可以同时编译出多个平台下的可执行文件，如果不需要多平台支持，可以直接用go编译，推荐使用LiteIDE。

## 包依赖问题

通过使用[glide](https://github.com/Masterminds/glide)工具可以解决包的依赖。安装glide后执行下列命令。

```shell
$ cd QuantBot
$ glide install
```

## 支持的交易所

| 交易所 | 货币类型 |
| -------- | ----- |
| zb | `BTC/USDT`, `ETH/USDT`, `EOS/USDT`, `LTC/USDT`, `QTUM/USDT` |

416,416,ThePhoDit/ModMail,TypeScript,"# [ModMail](https://modmail.phodit.xyz/)

ModMail is a Discord bot which main purpose is to provide user-to-moderator private communication.
This bot needs to be hosted, as it is meant for a single Discord server.

**Documentation:** https://modmail.phodit.xyz/

## How does it work?

When a user DMs the bot, a channel that only the staff can see is created in the server. From there, mods can discuss and reply to the conversation all within the same channel, getting some fancy logs when the thread is closed.

## How do I setup the bot?

Please, read the documentaion at https://modmail.phodit.xyz/ and check the installation section.

## What are the bot commands?

You can check the commands [here](https://modmail.phodit.xyz/commands/)."

## Dependencies:
* Node 12.x or higher, you can get it [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

## Installation:

To install this bot follow these simple steps.

1. Download and un-zip (or clone) the repo.

2. Install `node.js` you can get it [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

3. On Windows, open the command line. On Linux and MacOS, open a terminal.

4. Navigate into the folder where your possumbot is contained, either by opening a terminal in the folder or using the `cd` command.

5. Type `npm install` into the console.

> If it doesn't work make sure you have `node.js` installed. (You can install it [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).)
 If it still doesn't work restart your console.

6. Open your browser and go to [discord.com/developers](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/)
And create a new application and customize it to your liking.

You should see something like this:

![You should see something like this.](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/508571077958434839/511258005937979392/2018-11-11_21.14.15.png)

Navigate to the bot settings

Enable privileged gateway intents.
![Enable privileged gateway intents.](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/337631219439239169/793807581113090048/2020-12-30-134739_1393x407_scrot.png)

After enabling privileged gateway intents copy your token.

After you copied the token proceed to the next step.

7. Open the possumbot folder and navigate to `botsettings.json` and open it with a text editor.

It should look like this

![](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/508571077958434839/511260091899707392/2018-11-11_21.11.08.png)

8. Paste your token into the token field, and save the file. Don't remove the quotes.

9. Run start.bat (or start.sh if you're on linux), if the bot doesn't run, type `node bot.js` into the console.

10. A link will be generated in the console use it to invite the bot. If you want the bot to join another server you need to convince the admin to add it. If the bot doesn't have admin perms it won't work.

  your own profile page `https://ci.nodejs.org/user/<YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME>/configure`, by clicking the
  ""show API token"" button. Also See: https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Authenticating+scripted+clients
- **`JENKINS_JOB_URL_<REPO_NAME>`** (optional)<br>
  Only required for the trigger Jenkins build script, to know which job to trigger a build for when
  repository collaborator posts a comment to the bot. E.g. `JENKINS_JOB_URL_NODE=https://ci.nodejs.org/job/node-test-pull-request`
- **`JENKINS_BUILD_TOKEN_<REPO_NAME>`** (optional)<br>
  Only required for the trigger Jenkins build script. The authentication token configured for a particular
  Jenkins job, for remote scripts to trigger builds remotely. Found on the job configuration page in
  `Build Triggers -> Trigger builds remotely (e.g., from scripts)`.
- **`LOGIN_CREDENTIALS`**<br>
  Username and password used to protected the log files exposed in /logs. Expected format: `username:password`.
- **`KEEP_LOGS`**<br>
  Number of days to keep rotated log files, defaults to `10` if not set.
- **`LOGS_DIR`**<br>
  Directory where logs should be written and exposed by the `/logs` endpoint.

### Developing Locally

The bot will try to load a `.env` file at the root of the project if it exists to set environment varaibles. You will need to create one similar to this:

```
GITHUB_TOKEN=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
SSE_RELAY=https://hook-relay.herokuapp.com
```

**Note the additional `SSE_RELAY` variable:**
When developing locally, it is difficult to setup a GitHub webhook
pointing to the computer you are developing on. An easy workaround is to set the `SSE_RELAY` to the url of
[a SSE relay server](https://github.com/williamkapke/hook-relay) that will send the GitHub events via
[Server Sent Events](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/eventsource/basics/) instead. Another option
is to use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/).

You can use the [TestOrgPleaseIgnore](https://github.com/TestOrgPleaseIgnore) GitHub Organization, to test
your changes. Actions performed on the repos there will be sent to
[the SSE Relay](https://github.com/williamkapke/hook-relay). If you use your own Organization/Repository,
remember to set the webhook Secret to the same value as `GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET` (default `hush-hush`), and
to change the content type to `application/json` (default on the GitHub interface is 
`application/x-www-form-urlencoded`, which will not work with the bot).

The `GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET` environment variable is not required when using the relay.

**Run the bot:**
```bash
$ npm start
```

When developing a script, it is likely that you will only want to run the script(s) that you are working on. You may
pass an additional [glob](https://www.npmjs.com/package/glob) argument to specify which scripts to run.

```bash
$ SCRIPTS=./scripts/my-new-event-handler.js npm start
```

[![](https://img.shields.io/badge/awesome-status-brightgreen.svg)](status/status.md)
![Test](https://github.com/dkhamsing/awesome_bot/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)

`awesome_bot` checks for valid URLs in a file, it can be used to [verify pull requests](#validate-pull-requests) updating a README.

## Installation

    $ gem install awesome_bot

## Usage

### Command Line

``` shell
Usage: awesome_bot [file or files]
       awesome_bot [options]
    -f, --files [files]              Comma separated files to check
    -a, --allow [errors]             Status code errors to allow
        --allow-dupe                 Duplicate URLs are allowed
        --allow-ssl                  SSL errors are allowed
        --allow-redirect             Redirected URLs are allowed
        --allow-timeout              URLs that time out are allowed
        --base-url [base url]        Base URL to use for relative links
    -d, --request-delay [seconds]    Set request delay
    -t, --set-timeout [seconds]      Set connection timeout (default: 30)
        --skip-save-results          Skip saving results
    -w, --white-list [urls]          Comma separated URLs to white list
```

- You can check multiple files (comma separated or `*` pattern, look below for details).

- By default, duplicate URLs or any status code other than `200` are flagged as failures.

  - Use option `--allow-dupe` to allow duplicates.
  - Use option `--allow-redirect` to allow redirects.
  - Use option `--allow` to allow specific status code errors.
  - Use option `--white-list` (`-w` for short) to prevent links from being flagged: `-w domain1.com/post/article,domain2.com` white lists `domain1.com/post/article` and all links matching `domain2.com`.

### Docker Examples
If you do not want to install Ruby or its dependencies you can simply use Docker and Docker image.

Here is an example for checking the links in the Markdown files in your current directory/subdirectories:
```shell
docker run -ti --rm -v $PWD:/mnt:ro dkhamsing/awesome_bot --white-list ""test.com"" --allow-dupe --allow-redirect --skip-save-results `find . -name ""*.md""`
```

or just check the links in a single file located at `./templates/ubuntu.md`:

```shell
docker run -ti --rm -v $PWD:/mnt:ro dkhamsing/awesome_bot --allow-dupe --allow-redirect --skip-save-results ./templates/ubuntu.md
```

You always need to specify the path to the file so you cannot simply use `*.md`; instead use `ls *.md""`:
```shell
docker run -ti --rm -v $PWD:/mnt:ro dkhamsing/awesome_bot --white-list ""test.com"" --allow-dupe --allow-redirect --skip-save-results `ls *.md`
```

### Library

```ruby
irb(main):001:0> require 'awesome_bot'
=> true
irb(main):002:0> content = File.read 'README.md'
=> ""...""
irb(main):003:0> result = AwesomeBot.check content
=> #<AwesomeBot::Result:0x007fdde39f4408 @links=...>
# AwesomeBot Result with success, statuses_issues, dupes and more
irb(main):004:0> puts result.success ? 'No errors' : ':-('
:-(
```

## Validate Pull Requests

Does your GitHub README contain a lot of links? `awesome_bot` can help you validate them when a [pull request](https://github.com/dkhamsing/open-source-ios-apps/pull/159) is created (or a commit is pushed). It is used by:

- https://github.com/tiimgreen/github-cheat-sheet
- https://github.com/enaqx/awesome-react
- https://github.com/ziadoz/awesome-php
- https://github.com/vsouza/awesome-ios
- https://github.com/alebcay/awesome-shell
- https://github.com/matteocrippa/awesome-swift

and [more](status/status.md).

Tips

- Use the keyword [`[ci skip]`](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/customizing-the-build/) in your commit title/message to skip verification.
- Use [Danger](#danger).

### GitHub Actions

To use `awesome_bot` with GitHub Actions (workflows), here is an [example](https://github.com/dkhamsing/open-source-ios-apps/blob/master/.github/workflows/ruby.yml):

```yml
name: Ruby

on:
  push:
    branches: [ '*' ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ '*' ]

jobs:
  build:

    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Set up Ruby 2.6
      uses: actions/setup-ruby@v1
      with:
        ruby-version: 2.6.x
    - name: Checks
      run: |
        ruby .github/osia_convert.rb
        gem install awesome_bot
        ruby .github/osia_get_links.rb
        awesome_bot check-unique.txt --allow-ssl -a 302,429 -w xbmc/xbmc
```

### Travis CI

To use `awesome_bot` with Travis CI, [connect your repo](https://travis-ci.org/) and create a [`.travis.yml` file](https://github.com/ziadoz/awesome-php/blob/master/.travis.yml).

```yml
language: ruby
rvm: 2.4.1
before_script: gem install awesome_bot
script: awesome_bot README.md
```

To turn off email notifications, add the lines below

```yml
notifications:
  email: false
```

In case you want to use the docker image inside Travis CI follow this example which will check broken links in all `*.md` files in your repository:

```yml
sudo: required

services:
  - docker

script:
  # Link Checks
  - docker run -ti --rm -v $PWD:/mnt:ro dkhamsing/awesome_bot --allow-dupe --allow-redirect --skip-save-results `find . -name ""*.md""`
```

### More

[CircleCI](https://circleci.com), [Codeship](https://codeship.com/), and [Semaphore CI](https://semaphoreci.com/) support running tests without adding a file to the repo (a public configuration file can however help others contribute).

```
# Codeship
Setup
rvm use 2.4.1 --install
gem install awesome_bot

Test
awesome_bot README.md
```

```
# Semaphore CI
Language: Ruby
Ruby version: 2.4.1
Databases for: don't generate
Setup:
gem install awesome_bot
awesome_bot README.md
```

### Status Badge

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/unixorn/awesome-zsh-plugins.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/unixorn/awesome-zsh-plugins)

To add the Travis CI build status badge above to your project, use the following code

```
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/<username>/<project>.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/<username>/<project>)

i.e.
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dkhamsing/awesome_bot.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/dkhamsing/awesome_bot)
```

As it happens, the default code snippet provided contains a redirect so adding a badge could fail your status :sob:.. one way to fix this is to white list `travis-ci`, i.e.

```
- awesome_bot README.md --white-list travis-ci
```

You can also add a badge for other CI tools, check out [shields.io](https://shields.io/).

### Danger

Integrate `awesome_bot` with [Danger](https://github.com/danger/danger) and have results reported back to the [pull request](https://github.com/vsouza/awesome-ios/pull/1001).

![danger](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4723115/17375716/0cdd37cc-5967-11e6-8ae3-829060a786dc.png)

Here's the step in your **Dangerfile**:

```ruby
# Check links
require 'json'
results = File.read 'ab-results-README.md-markdown-table.json'
j = JSON.parse results
if j['error']==true
  fail j['title']
  markdown j['message']
end
```

Marge-bot is a merge-bot for GitLab that, beside other goodies,
implements
[the Not Rocket Science Rule Of Software Engineering:](http://graydon2.dreamwidth.org/1597.html)

> automatically maintain a repository of code that always passes all the tests.

— Graydon Hoare, main author of Rust

This simple rule of thumb is still nowadays surprisingly difficult to implement
with the state-of-the-art tools, and more so in a way that scales with team size
(also see our [blog
post](https://smarketshq.com/marge-bot-for-gitlab-keeps-master-always-green-6070e9d248df)).

Take, for instance, GitHub's well-known
[pull-request workflow](https://help.github.com/categories/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests).
Here, CI needs to pass on the branch before the pull request can be accepted but
after that, the branch is immediately merged (or rebased) into master. By the
time this happens, enough changes may have occurred to induce test breakage, but
this is only to be found out when the commits have already landed.

GitLab (in their [enterprise edition](https://about.gitlab.com/products/)),
offers an important improvement here with
their
[semi-linear history and fast-forward](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/) merge
request methods: in both cases a merge request can only be accepted if the
resulting master branch will be effectively the same as the merge request branch
on which CI has passed. If master has changed since the tests were last ran, it
is the *user's responsibility* to rebase the changes and retry. But this just
doesn't scale: if you have, a mono-repo, a large team working on short-lived
branches, a CI pipeline that takes 5-10 minutes to complete... then the number
of times one need's to rebase-and-try-to-accept starts to become unbearable.

Marge-bot offers the simplest of workflows: when a merge-request is ready, just
assign it to its user, and let her do all the rebase-wait-retry for you. If
anything goes wrong (merge conflicts, tests that fail, etc.) she'll leave a
message on the merge-request, so you'll get notified. Marge-bot can handle an
adversarial environment where some developers prefer to merge their own changes,
so the barrier for adoption is really low.

Whether marge-bot will or not wait for pipeline to succeed depends on the value of ""✓
Pipelines must succeed"" checkbox in your repo. It is available in all Gitlab
versions, so should not be a barrier.

Since she is at it, she can optionally provide some other goodies like tagging
of commits (e.g. `Reviewed-by: ...`) or preventing merges during certain hours.


## Configuring

Args that start with '--' (eg. `--auth-token`) can also be set in a config file
(specified via `--config-file`). The config file uses YAML syntax and must
represent a YAML 'mapping' (for details, see
http://learn.getgrav.org/advanced/yaml). If an arg is specified in more than one
place, then commandline values override environment variables which override
config file values which override defaults.

```bash
optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --config-file CONFIG_FILE
                        config file path   [env var: MARGE_CONFIG_FILE] (default: None)
  --auth-token TOKEN    Your GitLab token.
                        DISABLED because passing credentials on the command line is insecure:
                        You can still set it via ENV variable or config file, or use ""--auth-token-file"" flag.
                           [env var: MARGE_AUTH_TOKEN] (default: None)
  --auth-token-file FILE
                        Path to your GitLab token file.
                           [env var: MARGE_AUTH_TOKEN_FILE] (default: None)
  --gitlab-url URL      Your GitLab instance, e.g. ""https://gitlab.example.com"".
                           [env var: MARGE_GITLAB_URL] (default: None)
  --use-https           use HTTP(S) instead of SSH for GIT repository access
                           [env var: MARGE_USE_HTTPS] (default: False)
  --ssh-key KEY         The private ssh key for marge so it can clone/push.
                        DISABLED because passing credentials on the command line is insecure:
                        You can still set it via ENV variable or config file, or use ""--ssh-key-file"" flag.
                           [env var: MARGE_SSH_KEY] (default: None)
  --ssh-key-file FILE   Path to the private ssh key for marge so it can clone/push.
                           [env var: MARGE_SSH_KEY_FILE] (default: None)
  --embargo INTERVAL[,..]
                        Time(s) during which no merging is to take place, e.g. ""Friday 1pm - Monday 9am"".
                           [env var: MARGE_EMBARGO] (default: None)
  --use-merge-strategy  Use git merge instead of git rebase to update the *source* branch (EXPERIMENTAL)
                        If you need to use a strict no-rebase workflow (in most cases
                        you don't want this, even if you configured gitlab to use merge requests
                        to use merge commits on the *target* branch (the default).)
                           [env var: MARGE_USE_MERGE_STRATEGY] (default: False)
  --rebase-remotely     Instead of rebasing in a local clone of the repository, use GitLab's
                        built-in rebase functionality, via their API. Note that Marge can't add
                        information in the commits in this case.
                           [env var: MARGE_REBASE_REMOTELY] (default: False)
  --add-tested          Add ""Tested: marge-bot <$MR_URL>"" for the final commit on branch after it passed CI.
                           [env var: MARGE_ADD_TESTED] (default: False)
  --batch               Enable processing MRs in batches
                           [env var: MARGE_BATCH] (default: False)
  --add-part-of         Add ""Part-of: <$MR_URL>"" to each commit in MR.
                           [env var: MARGE_ADD_PART_OF] (default: False)
  --add-reviewers       Add ""Reviewed-by: $approver"" for each approver of MR to each commit in MR.

                        This is to handle the potential race condition where approvals don't reset in GitLab
                        after a force push due to slow processing of the event.

  --ci-timeout CI_TIMEOUT
                        How long to wait for CI to pass.

For more information about configuring marge-bot see `--help`


## Running

First, create a user for Marge-bot on your GitLab. We'll use `marge-bot` as
username here as well. GitLab sorts users by Name, so we recommend you pick one
that starts with a space, e.g. ` Marge Bot`, so it is quicker to assign to (our
code strips trailing whitespace in the name, so it won't show up elsewhere).
Then add `marge-bot` to your projects as `Developer` or `Maintainer`, the latter
being required if she will merge to protected branches.

For certain features, namely, `--impersonate-approvers`, and `--add-reviewers`,
you will need to grant `marge-bot` admin privileges as well. In the latter, so
that she can query the email of the reviewers to include it in the commit. Note
that if you're trying to run marge-bot against a GitLab instance you don't have
yourself admin access to (e.g. https://www.gitlab.com), you won't be able to use
features that require admin for marge-bot.

Second, you need an authentication token for the `marge-bot` user. You will need
to select the `api` and `read_user` scopes in all cases.

If marge-bot was made an admin to handle approver impersonation and/or adding a
reviewed-by field, then you will also need to add **`sudo`** scope under
`Impersonation Tokens` in the User Settings. Assuming your GitLab install is
install is `https://your-gitlab.example.com` the link will be at
`https://your-gitlab.example.com/admin/users/marge-bot/impersonation_tokens`).

On older GitLab installs, to be able to use impersonation features if marge-bot
was made an admin, use the **PRIVATE TOKEN** found in marge-bot's `Profile
Settings`; otherwise just use a personal token (you will need to impersonate the
marge-bot user via the admin UI to get the private token, it should then be at
`http://my-gitlab.example.com/profile/personal_access_tokens` reachable via
`Profile Settings -> Acess Tokens`).

Once you have the token, put it in a file, e.g. `marge-bot.token`.

Finally, create a new ssh key-pair, e.g like so

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C marge-bot@invalid -f marge-bot-ssh-key -P ''
```

Add the public key (`marge-bot-ssh-key.pub`) to the user's `SSH Keys` in GitLab
and keep the private one handy.

### Running marge-bot in docker using SSH (what we do)

Assuming you have already got docker installed, the quickest and most minimal
way to run marge is like so (*but see note about passing secrets on the
commandline below*):

```bash
docker run --restart=on-failure \ # restart if marge crashes because GitLab is flaky
  -e MARGE_AUTH_TOKEN=""$(cat marge-bot.token)"" \
  -e MARGE_SSH_KEY=""$(cat marge-bot-ssh-key)"" \
  smarkets/marge-bot \
  --gitlab-url='http://your.gitlab.instance.com'
```

Note that other users on the machine can see the secrets in `ps`, because
although they are env vars *inside* docker, we used a commandline switch to set
them for docker run.

To avoid that you have several options. You can just use a yaml file and mount
that into the container, for example this is how we actually run marge-bot at
Smarkets ourselves:

```yaml
# marge-bot-config.yml
add-part-of: true
add-reviewers: true
add-tested: true
impersonate-approvers: true
gitlab-url: ""https://git.corp.smarkets.com""
project-regexp: ""smarkets/smarkets$""
auth-token: ""WoNtTelly0u""
ssh-key: |
    -----BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----
    [...]
    -----END OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----
```

```bash
docker run --restart=on-failure \
  -v ""$(pwd)"":/configuration \
  smarkets/marge-bot \
  --config-file=/configuration/marge-bot-config.yaml
```

By default docker will use the `latest` tag, which corresponds to the latest
stable version. You can also use the `stable` tag to make this more explicit.
If you want a development version, you can use the `master` tag to obtain an
image built from the HEAD commit of the `master` branch. Note that this image
may contain bugs.

You can also specify a particular version as a tag, e.g.
`smarkets/marge-bot:0.7.0`.

### Running marge-bot in docker using HTTPS

It is also possible to use Git over HTTPS instead of Git over SSH. To use HTTPS instead of SSH,
add the `--use-https` flag and do not provide any SSH keys. Alternatively you can set the
environment variable `MARGE_USE_HTTPS` or the config file property `use-https`.

```bash
docker run --restart=on-failure \ # restart if marge crashes because GitLab is flaky
  -e MARGE_AUTH_TOKEN=""$(cat marge-bot.token)"" \
  smarkets/marge-bot \
  --use-https \
  --gitlab-url='http://your.gitlab.instance.com'
```

HTTPS can be used using any other deployment technique as well.

### Running marge-bot in kubernetes
It's also possible to run marge in kubernetes, e.g. here's how you use a ktmpl
template:

```bash
ktmpl ./deploy.yml \
--parameter APP_NAME ""marge-bot"" \
--parameter APP_IMAGE ""smarkets/marge-bot"" \
--parameter KUBE_NAMESPACE ""marge-bot"" \
--parameter MARGE_GITLAB_URL 'http://your.gitlab.instance.com' \
--parameter MARGE_AUTH_TOKEN ""$(cat marge-bot.token)"" \
--parameter MARGE_SSH_KEY ""$(cat marge-bot-ssh-key)"" \
--parameter REPLICA_COUNT 1 | kubectl -n=${KUBE_NAMESPACE} apply --force -f -
```

Once running, the bot will continuously monitor all projects that have its user as a member and
will pick up any changes in membership at runtime.

### Running marge-bot in Swarm
Or you can run marge in Docker Swarm, e.g. here's how you use a compose file:

```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  marge-bot:
    image: smarkets/marge-bot:latest
    configs:
      - source: marge_bot_config
        target: /configuration/marge-bot-config.yaml
    command:
      - ""--config-file=/configuration/marge-bot-config.yaml""
    deploy:
      mode: replicated
      replicas: 1
      restart_policy:
        condition: on-failure
      resources:
        limits:
          memory: 256M

configs:
  marge_bot_config:
    file: ./marge-bot-config.yaml
    name: marge_bot_config
```

### Running marge-bot in CI

You can also run marge-bot directly in your existing CI via scheduled pipelines
if you'd like to avoid setting up any additional infrastructure.

This way, you can inject secrets for marge-bot's credentials at runtime
inside the ephemeral container for each run by adding them to protected CI/CD
variables in a dedicated marge-bot runner project, as well as store execution
logs as artifacts for evidence.

You can also configure multiple setups in different CI schedules by supplying
`MARGE_*` environment variables per-schedule, such as running a different set
of projects or settings at different times.

Note that in this case, marge-bot will be slower than when run as a service,
depending on the frequency of your pipeline schedules.

Create a marge-bot runner project, and add the variables `MARGE_AUTH_TOKEN`
(of type Variable) and `MARGE_SSH_KEY_FILE` (of type File) in your CI/CD
Variables settings.

Then add a scheduled pipeline run to your project with the following minimal
`.gitlab-ci.yml` config:

```yaml
run:
  image:
    name: smarkets/marge-bot:latest
    entrypoint: [""""]
  only:
    - schedules
  variables:
    MARGE_CLI: ""true""
    MARGE_GITLAB_URL: ""$CI_SERVER_URL""
  script: marge.app
```

### Running marge-bot as a plain python app

#### Installing marge-bot with nix

Alternatively, if you prefer not to use docker, you can also directly run marge.
If you use [nix](https://nixos.org/nix/) do `nix-env --install -f default.nix`.

The nix install should be fully reproducible on any version of linux (and also
work on OS X, although this is not something we properly test). If you don't
want to use docker we recommend you give nix a try.

#### Installing marge-bot the old-fashioned way

Finally, although this is our least preferred alternative, you can always do
`python3 setup.py install` (note that you will need python3.6).

Afterwards, the minimal way to run marge is as follows.

```bash
marge.app --auth-token-file marge-bot.token \
          --gitlab-url 'http://your.gitlab.instance.com' \
          --ssh-key-file marge-bot-ssh-key
```

However, we suggest you use a systemd unit file or some other mechanism to
automatically restart marge-bot in case of intermittent GitLab problems.

## Suggested workflow
1. Alice creates a new merge request and assigns Bob and Charlie as reviewers

2. Both review the code and after all issues they raise are resolved by Alice,
   they approve the merge request and assign it to `marge-bot` for merging.

3. Marge-bot rebases the latest target branch (typically master) into the
   merge-request branch and pushes it. Once the tests have passed and there is a
   sufficient number of approvals (if a minimal approvals limit has been set on
   the project), Marge-bot will merge (or rebase, depending on project settings)
   the merge request via the GitLab API. It can also add some headers to all
   commits in the merge request as described in the next section.


## Adding Reviewed-by:, Tested: and Part-of: to commit messages

Marge-bot supports automated addition of the following
two [standardized git commit trailers](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v4.11/process/submitting-patches.html#using-reported-by-tested-by-reviewed-by-suggested-by-and-fixes):
`Reviewed-by` and `Tested-by`. For the latter it uses `Marge Bot
<$MERGE_REQUEST_URL>` as a slight abuse of the convention (here `Marge Bot` is
the name of the `marge-bot` user in GitLab).

If you pass `--add-reviewers` and the list of approvers is non-empty and you
have enough approvers to meet the required approver count, Marge will add the
following header to each commit message and each reviewer as it rebases the
target branch into your PR branch:

```
Reviewed-by: A. Reviewer <a.reviewer@example.com>
```

All existing `Reviewed-by:` trailers on commits in the branch will be stripped. This
feature requires marge to run with admin privileges due to a peculiarity of the
GitLab API: only admin users can obtain email addresses of other users, even
ones explicitly declared as public (strangely this limitation is particular to
email, Skype handles etc. are visible to everyone).

If you pass `--add-tested` the final commit message in a PR will be tagged with
`Tested-by: marge-bot <$MERGE_REQUEST_URL>` trailer. This can be very useful for
two reasons:

1. Seeing where stuff ""came from"" in a rebase-based workflow
2. Knowing that a commit has been tested, which is e.g. important for bisection
   so you can easily and automatically `git bisect --skip` untested commits.

Additionally, by using `--add-part-of`, all commit messages will be tagged with
a `Part-of: <$MERGE_REQUEST_URL>` trailer to the merge request on which they
were merged. This is useful, for example, to go from a commit shown in `git
blame` to the merge request on which it was introduced or to easily revert a all
commits introduced by a single Merge Request when using a fast-forward/rebase
based merge workflow.

## Impersonating approvers
If you want a full audit trail, you will configure GitLab
[require approvals](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/merge_request_approvals.html#approvals-required)
for PRs and also turn on
[reset approvals on push](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/merge_request_approvals.html#reset-approvals-on-push).
Unfortunately, since Marge-bot's flow is based on pushing to the source branch, this
means it will reset the approval status if the latter option is enabled.
However, if you have given Marge-bot admin privileges and turned on
`--impersonate-approvers`, she will re-approve the merge request assuming after its own
push, but by impersonating the existing approvers.

## Merge embargoes

Marge-bot can be configured not to merge during certain periods. E.g., to prevent
her from merging during weekends, add `--embargo 'Friday 6pm - Monday 9am'`.
This is useful for example if you automatically deploy from master and want to
prevent shipping late on a Friday, but still want to allow marking merge requests as
""to be merged on Monday"": just assign them to `marge-bot` as any other day.

More than one embargo period can be specified, separated by commas. Any merge
request assigned to her during an embargo period, will be merged in only once all
embargoes are over.


## Batching Merge Requests

The flag `--batch` enables testing and merging merge requests in batches. This can
significantly speed up the rate at which marge-bot processes jobs - not just
because merge requests can be tested together, but because marge-bot will ensure
the whole set of merge requests is mergeable first. This includes, for example,
checking if a merge request is marked as WIP, or does not have enough approvals.
Essentially, users get faster feedback if there is an issue. Note that you
probably won't need this unless you have tens of merge requests a day (or
extremely slow CI).

### How it works

If marge-bot finds multiple merge requests to deal with, she attempts to create
a batch job. She filters the merge requests such that they have all have a
common target branch, and eliminates those that have not yet passed CI (a
heuristic to help guarantee the batch will pass CI later).

Once the merge requests have been gathered, a batch branch is created using the
commits from each merge request in sequence. Any merge request that cannot be
merged to this branch (e.g. due to a rebase conflict) is filtered out. A new
merge request is then created for this branch, and tested in CI.

If CI passes, the original merge requests will be merged one by one.

If the batch job fails for any reason, we fall back to merging the first merge
request, before attempting a new batch job.

### Limitations

* Currently we still add the tested-by trailer for each merge request's final
  commit in the batch, but it would probably be more correct to add the trailer
  only to the last commit in the whole batch request (since that's the only one
  we know passed for sure in that combination). We might change this in the
  future or make it configurable, but note that there's still a much stronger
  chance all intermittent final commits also passed then when just testing on
  each source branch, because we know the final linearization of all commits
  passes in that all MRs passed individually on their branches.

* As trailers are added to the original merge requests only, their branches
  would need to be pushed to in order to reflect this change. This would trigger
  CI in each of the branches again that would have to be passed before merging,
  which effectively defeats the point of batching. To workaround this, the
  current implementation merges to the target branch through git, instead of the
  GitLab API. GitLab will detect the merge request as having been merged, and
  update the merge request status accordingly, regardless of whether it has
  passed CI. This does still mean the triggered CI jobs will be running even
  though the merge requests are merged. marge-bot will attempt to cancel these
  pipelines, although this doesn't work too effectively if external CI is used.

* There is what can be considered to be a flaw in this implementation that could
  potentially result in a non-green master; consider the following situation:

  1. A batch merge request is created, and passes CI.
  2. Several merge requests are then merged to master, but one could fail
     (perhaps due to someone pushing directly to master in between).
  3. At this point, marge-bot will abort the batch job, resulting in a subset of
     the batch merge requests having been merged.

  We've guaranteed that individually, each of these merge requests pass CI, and
  together with some extra merge requests they also pass CI, but this does not
  guarantee that the subset will. However, this would only happen in a rather
  convoluted situation that can be considered to be very rare.

## Restricting the list of projects marge-bot considers

By default marge-bot will work on all projects that she is a member of.
Sometimes it is useful to restrict a specific instance of marge-bot to a subset
of projects. You can specify a regexp that projects must match (anchored at the
start of the string) with `--project-regexp`.

One use-case is if you want to use different configurations (e.g.
`--add-reviewers` on one project, but not the others). A simple way of doing is
run two instances of marge-bot passing `--add-reviewers --project-regexp
project/with_reviewers` to the first instance and `--project-regexp
(?!project/with_reviewers)` to the second ones. The latter regexp is a negative
look-ahead and will match any string not starting with `project/with_reviewers`.

## Restricting the list of branches marge-bot considers

It is also possible to restrict the branches marge-bot watches for incoming
merge requests. By default, marge-bot will process MRs targeted for any branch.
You may specify a regexp that target branches must match with `--branch-regexp`.

This could be useful, if for instance, you wanted to set a regular freeze
interval on your master branches for releases. You could have one instance of
marge-bot with `--embargo ""Friday 1pm - Monday 9am"" --branch-regexp master` and
the other with `--branch-regexp (?!master)`. This would allow development to
continue on other branches during the embargo on master.

It is possible to restrict the source branches with `--source-branch-regexp`.

## Some handy git aliases

Only `git bisect run` on commits that have passed CI (requires running marge-bot with `--add-tested`):
```
git config --global alias.bisect-run-tested \
 'f() { git bisect run /bin/sh -c ""if !(git log -1 --format %B | fgrep -q \""Tested-by: Marge Bot\""); then exit 125; else ""$@""; fi""; }; f'
```
E.g. `git bisect-run-tested ./test-for-some-bug.sh`.

Revert a whole MR, in a rebase based workflow (requires running marge-bot with `--add-part-of`):
```
git config --global alias.mr-revs '!f() { git log --grep ""^Part-of.*/""""$1"""">"" --pretty=""%H""; }; f'
git config --global alias.mr-url '!f() { git log -1 --grep ""^Part-of.*/""""$1"""">"" --pretty=""%b"" | grep ""^Part-of.*/""""$1"""">""  | sed ""s/.*<\\(.*\\)>/\\1/""; }; f'
git config --global alias.revert-mr '!f() { REVS=$(git mr-revs ""$1""); URL=""$(git mr-url ""$1"")"";  git revert --no-commit $REVS;  git commit -m ""Revert <$URL>$(echo;echo; echo ""$REVS"" | xargs -I% echo ""This reverts commit %."")""; }; f'
```

E.g. `git revert-mr 123`. This will create a single commit reverting all commits
that are part of MR 123 with a commit message that looks like this:

```
Revert <http://gitlab.example.com/mygropup/myproject/merge_requests/123>

This reverts commit 86a3d35d9bc12e735efbf72f3e2fb895c0158713.
This reverts commit e862330a6df463e36137664f316c18b5836a4df7.
This reverts commit 0af5b70a98858c9509c895da2a673ebdb31e20b1.
```

E.g. `git revert-mr 123`.


## Troubleshooting

Marge-bot continuously logs what she is doing, so this is a good place to look
in case of issues. In addition, by passing the `--debug` flag, additional info
such as REST requests and responses will be logged. When opening an issue,
please include a relevant section of the log, ideally ran with `--debug` enabled.

The most common source of issues is the presence of git-hooks that reject
Marge-bot as a committer. These may have been explicitly installed by someone in
your organization or they may come from the project configuration. E.g., if you
are using `Settings -> Repository -> Commit author's email`, you may need to
whitelist `marge-bot`'s email.

Some versions of GitLab are not good at reporting merge failures due to hooks
(the REST API may even claim the merge operation succeeded), you can find
this in `gitlab-rails/githost.log`, under GitLab's logs directory.

A sample bot for getting started with Bot Framework on Azure.

This repo is an example of using Node.js to build a bot, which is hosted on Azure and uses continuous deployment from Github.

Here's how to use this bot as a starter template for your own Node.js based bot:

*note: in the examples below, replace ""echobotsamplev3"" with your bot ID for any settings or URLs.*

1. Fork this repo.
2. Create an Azure web app.
![](images/azure-create-webapp.png?raw=true)
3. Set up continuous deployment to Azure from your Github repo. You will be asked to authorize Azure access to your GitHub repo, and then choose your branch from which to deploy.
![](images/azure-deployment.png?raw=true)
4. Verify the deployment has completed by visiting the web app. [http://echobotsamplev3.azurewebsites.net/](https://echobotsamplev3.azurewebsites.net/). It may take a minute of two for the initial fetch and build from your repo.
![](images/azure-browse.png?raw=true)
5. [Register your bot with the Bot Framework](http://docs.botframework.com/connector/getstarted/#registering-your-bot-with-the-microsoft-bot-framework) using **https://echobotsamplev3.azurewebsites.net/api/messages** as your endpoint.
6. Enter your Bot Framework App ID and App Secret into Azure settings.
![](images/azure-secrets.png?raw=true)
7. [Test the connection to your bot](http://docs.botframework.com/connector/getstarted/#testing-the-connection-to-your-bot) from the Bot Framework developer portal.

## Testing locally
* git clone this repo.
* npm install
* node ./server.js
* Visit [http://localhost:3978/](http://localhost:3978/) to see the home page.
* Use **http://localhost:3978/api/messages** in the [Bot Framework Emulator](http://docs.botframework.com/connector/tools/bot-framework-emulator/#navtitle)
   
## Helpful hints:
* Your web app will deploy whenever you git push to your repo. Changing the text of your index.html and visiting your homepage is a simple way to see that your latest deployment has been published to Azure.
* Azure ""knows"" your app is a NodeJs app by the presence of the ""server.js"" file. Renaming this file may possibly cause Azure to not execute NodeJs code.
* Azure app settings become NodeJS process.env variables.
* Use https when specifying URLs in the Bot Framework developer portal. Your app secret will not be transmitted unless it is secure.

## Dependencies

Firstly you need to install some dependencies such as Boost and build tools such as CMake. On Debian-based distibutives you can do it with these commands:
```sh
sudo apt-get install g++ make binutils cmake libssl-dev libboost-system-dev zlib1g-dev
```
If you want to use curl-based http client `CurlHttpClient`, you also need to install `libcurl4-openssl-dev` package.

## Library installation

If you want to install the library system-wide:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/reo7sp/tgbot-cpp
cd tgbot-cpp
cmake .
make -j4
sudo make install
```

You can treat this repository as a submodule of your project, for example, see [echobot-submodule](samples/echobot-submodule/CMakeLists.txt)

You can use Docker to build and run your bot. Set the base image of your's Dockerfile to [reo7sp/tgbot-cpp](https://hub.docker.com/r/reo7sp/tgbot-cpp/).

========

Control your 3D Printer over the Internet.  Out of the box support for slicing, webcams, queue-based job management, temperature logging, API, and much more.  BotQueue works great for controlling a single 3D printer or dozens of printers.  Control your bot from anywhere in the world, even using your cellphone!  Currently supports RepRap style machines, but will expand to others if there is interest.

The main BotQueue site is at www.botqueue.com

Is this project dead?
-------------

Nope! I took a hiatus for a little while, but am back to working on this project. I'm working on the [v2.0-dev](https://github.com/Hoektronics/BotQueue/tree/v2.0-dev) branch. What I'll be doing most of the time is branching off of laravel2 and then submitting pull requests to make sure everything builds correctly. Once I'm satisfied with the full upgrade/redesign, I'll land the laravel2 branch onto master and deploy to the [main site](http://www.botqueue.com). If you're a registered user at that site, you'll get an email when the beta site goes live as well as when the main site is live with the new version. Look forward to it!

Philosophy and Goals
-------------

Digital fabrication / manufacturing is set to become one of the most important technologies of the 21st century.  Taking a cue from one of the most important technologies of the 20th century (the Internet) I believe that access to free and open tools is extremely important.  Allowing people of all skill levels access to these tools allows learning, innovation, and entrepreneurship to flower.  BotQueue aims to fulfill three goals:

1. Play Well With Others - interface with any digital fabrication device that will allow itself to be interfaced with.
1. Open and Free - all software behind BotQueue should be open source and freely available.  Both server and client side.
1. High Standards of Quality - lets build awesome software for everyone to do amazing things with!

Installation
-------------

Please visit http://www.botqueue.com/help for instructions on installing the software.

1. Check for open issues or open a fresh issue on Github to start a discussion around a feature idea or a bug.
1. Fork the repository on Github to start making your changes.
1. Write a test which shows that the bug was fixed or that the feature works as expected.
1. Send a pull request and bug the maintainer until it gets merged and published. :) Make sure to add yourself to the contributors list below and the about page (web/views/main/about.php)

Contributors

We've received lots of help along the way, and here are some people who have contributed greatly to the BotQueue project directly or indirectly:

* Zach Hoeken Smith (project founder)
* Justin Nesselrotte (code+support)
* Joe Walnes (gcode display plugin)
* Tony Buser (stl viewer plugin)
* Alessandro Ranellucci (slic3r)

Of course this project also owes a huge debt to the many people who have developed awesome open source 3D printers, electronics, firmware, and all the other things that BotQueue is built on top of. Keep on rocking!

</p>

Bot to verify if a new user, who joins a group, is a human.
The Bot sends an image captcha for each new user, and kicks any of them that can't solve the captcha in a specified amount of time. Also, any message that contains an URL sent by a new ""user"" before captcha completion will be considered Spam and will be deleted.

BTC:

## Installation

Note: Use Python 3.6 or above to install and run the Bot, previous version are unsupported.

To generate Captchas, the Bot uses [multicolor_captcha_generator library](https://github.com/J-Rios/multicolor_captcha_generator), wich uses Pillow to generate the images.

1. Install Pillow prerequisites:

    ```bash
    sudo apt install -y libtiff5-dev libjpeg62-turbo-dev zlib1g-dev libfreetype6-dev liblcms2-dev libwebp-dev tcl8.6-dev tk8.6-dev python-tk
    ```

2. Get the project and install JoinCaptchaBot requirements:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/J-Rios/TLG_JoinCaptchaBot
    pip install -r TLG_JoinCaptchaBot/requirements.txt
    ```

3. Go to project sources and give execution permission to usage scripts:

    ```bash
    cd TLG_JoinCaptchaBot/sources
    chmod +x run status kill
    ```

4. Specify Telegram Bot account Token (get it from @BotFather) in ""settings.py"" file:

    ```python
    'TOKEN' : 'XXXXXXXXX:XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX'
    ```

## Usage

To ease usage a `run`, `status`, and `kill` scripts have been provided.

- Launch the Bot:  
`./run`

- Check if the script is running:  
`./status`

- Stop the Bot:  
`./kill`

## Systemd service

For systemd based systems, you can setup the Bot as daemon service.

To do that, you need to create a new service description file for the Bot as follow:

```bash
[vim or nano] /etc/systemd/system/bot.service
```

File content:

```bash
[Unit]
Description=Bot Telegram Daemon
Wants=network-online.target
After=network-online.target

[Service]
Type=forking
WorkingDirectory=/path/to/dir/sources/
ExecStart=/path/to/dir/sources/run
ExecReload=/path/to/dir/sources/kill

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Then, to add the new service into systemd, you should enable it:

```bash
systemctl enable --now bot.service
```

Remember that, if you wan't to disable it, you should execute:

```bash
systemctl disable bot.service
```

## Docker

You can also run the bot on [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/). This allows easy
server migration and automates the download of all dependencies. Look at the
[docker specific documentation](docker/README.md) for more details about how to create a Docker Container for Captcha Bot.

## Bot Owner

The **Bot Owner** can run special commands that no one else can use, like /allowgroup (if the Bot is private, this allow groups where the Bot can be used) or /allowuserlist (to make Bot don't ask for captcha to some users, useful for blind users).

You can setup a Bot Owner by specifying the Telegram User ID or Alias in ""settings.py"" file:

```python
""BOT_OWNER"": ""@JoseTLG"",
```

## Make Bot Private

By default, the Bot is **Public**, so any Telegram user can add and use the Bot in any group, but you can set it to be **Private** so the Bot just can be used in allowed groups (Bot owner allows them with **/allow_group** command).

You can set Bot to be Private in ""settings.py"" file:

```python
""BOT_PRIVATE"" : True,
```

**Note:** If you have a Public Bot and set it to Private, it will leave any group where is not allowed to be used when a new user joins.

**Note:** Telegram Private Groups could changes their chat ID when it become a public supergroup, so the Bot will leave the group and the owner has to set the new group chat ID with /allow_group.

## Scalability (Polling or Webhook)

By default, Bot checks and receives updates from Telegram Servers by **Polling** (requests and get if there is any new updates in the Bot account corresponding to that Bot Token), this is really simple and can be used for low to median scale Bots. However, you can configure the Bot to use a **Webhook** instead if you expect to handle a large number of users/groups.

To use Webhook instead Polling, you need a signed certificate file in the system, you can create the key file and self-sign the cert through openssl tool:

```bash
openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -sha256 -nodes -keyout private.key -x509 -days 3650 -out cert.pem
```

Once you have the key and cert files, setup the next lines in ""settings.py"" file to point to expected Webhook Host address, port and certificate file:

```python
""WEBHOOK_HOST"": ""Current system IP/DNS here"",
""WEBHOOK_PORT"": 8443,
""WEBHOOK_CERT"" : SCRIPT_PATH + ""/cert.pem"",
""WEBHOOK_CERT_PRIV_KEY"" : SCRIPT_PATH + ""/private.key"",
```

To use Polling instead Webhook, just set host value back to none:

```python
""WEBHOOK_HOST"": ""None"",
```

## Environment Variables Setup

You can setup some Bot properties manually changing their values in settings.py file, but also you can use enviroment variables to setup all that properties (this is really useful for advance deployment when using [Virtual Enviroments](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html) and/or [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/) to isolate the Bot process execution).

## Adding a New Language

Actual language support is based on external JSON files that contain all bot texts for each language.

To add support for a new language you must follow this steps:

1. Fork the project repository, clone it and create a new branch to work on it (i.e. named language-support-en).

2. Copy from one of the existing language JSON files from [here](https://github.com/J-Rios/TLG_JoinCaptchaBot/tree/master/sources/language) to a new one.

3. Change the name of that file for the language ISO Code of the language that you want.

4. Translate each text from JSON key values of the file without breaking the JSON format/structure (it should be valid for JSON parsers) and maintaining JSON key names. Keep command names in english (i.e. don't translate ""START"", ""HELP""... /start /help ...) and don't remove special characters (like {}, "", ', \n...) too!

5. Make a pull request of that branch with the new language file into this repository and wait for it to be accepted.

6. Then, I will make the integration into source code and actual Bot account (@join_captcha_bot).

7. Enjoy the new language :)

# BottomSheetCoordinatorLayout

```groovy
implementation 'com.otaliastudios:bottomsheetcoordinatorlayout:1.0.4'
```

A handy `CoordinatorLayout` that works well when used in a bottom sheet, even with `AppBarLayout`s inside.

<p align=""center"">
  <img src=""art/bottom1.gif"" width=""250"" vspace=""20"">
</p>

*Having issues with android.support v28? Please try `com.otaliastudios:bottomsheetcoordinatorlayout:1.1.0-RC1`.*

## Usage

Just use `BottomSheetCoordinatorLayout` as the root view of your bottom sheet. It will be automatically
given the right `BottomSheetBehavior`.

```xml
<com.otaliastudios.bottomsheetcoordinatorlayout.BottomSheetCoordinatorLayout
    android:layout_width=""match_parent""
    android:layout_height=""match_parent"">
    
    <!-- AppBarLayout -->
    
    <!-- Everything else -->
    
</com.otaliastudios.bottomsheetcoordinatorlayout.BottomSheetCoordinatorLayout>
```

To get an instance of the behavior, use `bscl.getBehavior()`.
As usual with behaviors, the returned value might be null if the view has not gone through a layout,
so wait for that.

If you just want to set appropriate `BottomSheetCallback`, you can use `bscl.setBottomSheetCallback()`.
Callbacks will be added to the sheet behavior as soon as it is available, so this can be called safely
whenever you want. Same goes for other set() methods: they will apply the result to the behavior as soon
as it is available.

## Features

- Highly customizable `persistent` bottom navigation bar.
- Ability to push new screens with or without bottom navigation bar.
- 20 styles for the bottom navigation bar.
- Includes functions for pushing screen with or without the bottom navigation bar i.e. pushNewScreen() and pushNewScreenWithRouteSettings().
- Based on flutter's Cupertino(iOS) bottom navigation bar.
- Can be `translucent` for a particular tab.
- Custom styling for the navigation bar. Click [here](#custom-navigation-bar-styling) for more information.
- Handles hardware/software Android back button.

## Getting Started

In your flutter project add the dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  persistent_bottom_nav_bar: any
```

Import the package:

```dart
import 'package:persistent_bottom_nav_bar/persistent-tab-view.dart';
```

Persistent bottom navigation bar uses `PersistentTabController` as its controller. Here is how to declare it:

```dart
PersistentTabController _controller;

_controller = PersistentTabController(initialIndex: 0);

```

The main widget then to be declared is `PersistentTabView`. NOTE: This widget includes SCAFFOLD (based on `CupertinoTabScaffold`), so no need to declare it. Following is an example for demonstration purposes:

```dart

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  const MyApp({Key key}) : super(key: key);

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return PersistentTabView(
        context,
        controller: _controller,
        screens: _buildScreens(),
        items: _navBarsItems(),
        confineInSafeArea: true,
        backgroundColor: Colors.white, // Default is Colors.white.
        handleAndroidBackButtonPress: true, // Default is true.
        resizeToAvoidBottomInset: true, // This needs to be true if you want to move up the screen when keyboard appears. Default is true.
        stateManagement: true, // Default is true.
        hideNavigationBarWhenKeyboardShows: true, // Recommended to set 'resizeToAvoidBottomInset' as true while using this argument. Default is true.
        decoration: NavBarDecoration(
          borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(10.0),
          colorBehindNavBar: Colors.white,
        ),
        popAllScreensOnTapOfSelectedTab: true,
        popActionScreens: PopActionScreensType.all,
        itemAnimationProperties: ItemAnimationProperties( // Navigation Bar's items animation properties.
          duration: Duration(milliseconds: 200),
          curve: Curves.ease,
        ),
        screenTransitionAnimation: ScreenTransitionAnimation( // Screen transition animation on change of selected tab.
          animateTabTransition: true,
          curve: Curves.ease,
          duration: Duration(milliseconds: 200),
        ),
        navBarStyle: NavBarStyle.style1, // Choose the nav bar style with this property.
    );
  }
}

```

```dart

    List<Widget> _buildScreens() {
        return [
          MainScreen(),
          SettingsScreen()
        ];
    }

```

```dart

    List<PersistentBottomNavBarItem> _navBarsItems() {
        return [
            PersistentBottomNavBarItem(
                icon: Icon(CupertinoIcons.home),
                title: (""Home""),
                activeColorPrimary: CupertinoColors.activeBlue,
                inactiveColorPrimary: CupertinoColors.systemGrey,
            ),
            PersistentBottomNavBarItem(
                icon: Icon(CupertinoIcons.settings),
                title: (""Settings""),
                activeColorPrimary: CupertinoColors.activeBlue,
                inactiveColorPrimary: CupertinoColors.systemGrey,
            ),
        ];
    }

```

## Navigator Functions

**Note: You still can use regular Navigator functions like 'pushNamed' but be sure to check the argument `routeAndNavigatorSettings` your `PersistentBottomNavBarItem` for route settings and some other navigator related properties**
To push a new screen, use the following functions to control the `visibility` of bottom navigation bar on a particular screen. You can use your own logic to implement `platform-specific` behavior. One of the solutions could be to use the property `withNavBar` and toggle it according to the Platform.

In `platform-specific` behavior, while pushing a new screen, on `Android` it will push the screen WITHOUT the bottom navigation bar but on `iOS` it will persist the bottom navigation bar. This is the default behavior specified by each platform.

```dart

    pushNewScreen(
        context,
        screen: MainScreen(),
        withNavBar: true, // OPTIONAL VALUE. True by default.
        pageTransitionAnimation: PageTransitionAnimation.cupertino,
    );

```

```dart

    pushNewScreenWithRouteSettings(
        context,
        settings: RouteSettings(name: MainScreen.routeName),
        screen: MainScreen(),
        withNavBar: true,
        pageTransitionAnimation: PageTransitionAnimation.cupertino,
    );

```

If you are pushing a new `modal` screen, use the following function:

```dart

    pushDynamicScreen(
        context,
        screen: HomeModalScreen(),
        withNavBar: true,
    );

```

### Some Useful Tips

- Pop to any screen in the navigation graph for a given tab:

    ```dart
        Navigator.of(context).popUntil((route) {
            return route.settings.name == ""ScreenToPopBackTo"";
        });
    ```

- Pop back to first screen in the navigation graph for a given tab:

    ```dart
        Navigator.of(context).popUntil(ModalRoute.withName(""/""));
    ```

    ```dart
        Navigator.of(context).pushAndRemoveUntil(
          CupertinoPageRoute(
            builder: (BuildContext context) {
              return FirstScreen();
            },
          ),
          (_) => false,
        );
    ```

- To push bottom sheet on top of the Navigation Bar, use showModalBottomScreen and set it's property `useRootNavigator` to true. See example project for an illustration.

## Custom Navigation Bar Styling

If you want to have your own style for the navigation bar, follow these steps:

1. Declare your custom widget. Please keep in mind that you will have to handle the function `onSelectedItem` and the integer `selectedIndex` yourself to maintain full functionality. Also please note that you can define your own model for the navigation bar item instead of the provided `PersistentBottomNavBarItem`. See this example below for better understanding:

    ```dart

        class CustomNavBarWidget extends StatelessWidget {
            final int selectedIndex;
            final List<PersistentBottomNavBarItem> items; // NOTE: You CAN declare your own model here instead of `PersistentBottomNavBarItem`.
            final ValueChanged<int> onItemSelected;

            CustomNavBarWidget(
                {Key key,
                this.selectedIndex,
                @required this.items,
                this.onItemSelected,});

            Widget _buildItem(
                PersistentBottomNavBarItem item, bool isSelected) {

                );
            }
        }

    ```

2. In the main `PersistentTabView` widget, set the `navBarStyle` property as `NavBarStyle.custom` and pass on the custom widget you just created in the `customWidget` property like this:

    ```dart

    class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
        const MyApp({Key key}) : super(key: key);

        @override
        Widget build(BuildContext context) {
            return PersistentTabView.custom(
                context,
                controller: _controller,
                itemCount: items.length, // This is required in case of custom style! Pass the number of items for the nav bar.
                screens: _buildScreens(),
                confineInSafeArea: true,
                handleAndroidBackButtonPress: true,
                onItemSelected: (int) {
                    setState(() {}); // This is required to update the nav bar if Android back button is pressed
                },
                customWidget: CustomNavBarWidget( // Your custom widget goes here
                    items: _navBarsItems(),
                    selectedIndex: _controller.index,
                    onItemSelected: (index) {
                        setState(() {
                            _controller.index = index; // NOTE: THIS IS CRITICAL!! Don't miss it!
                        });
                    },
                ),
            );
        }
    }

    ```

    `NOTE: In the 'onSelected' function of the customWidget, don't forgot to change the index of the controller`

3. Done! As we can see, some of the other properties like `iconSize`, `items` are not required here so you can skip those properties. To control the **bottom padding** of the screen, use `bottomScreenPadding`. If you give too much `bottomScreenPadding` but less height in the custom widget or vice versa, layout issues might appear.

For better understanding, refer to the [example project](https://github.com/BilalShahid13/PersistentBottomNavBar/tree/master/example) in the official git repo."

基于官方的BottomNavigationView 搭配 ViewPager服用；

貌似目前的这个官方库还不能支持切换当前选中的Item,所以在4个TAB以上，并且通过ViewPager切换时就有坑了，试一下就知道...

更新：
通过反射去掉了默认的切换效果，完美支持ViewPager联动。

A sample app for Bottom Navigation View with ViewPager 
![ScreenShot](http://droidmentor.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/BNV_with_ViewPager.jpg)

For connecting BottomNavigationView with ViewPager, you need to follow thesesteps

1. First, you need to create an application with latest Design Support Library(25) to your build.gradle to use BottomNavigationView.

2. Then add all the necessary resources ( color, drawable’s ) to the resource directory.

3. Create a view with ViewPager and BottomNavigationView

4. Create necessary fragments for each tab on the viewpager.
 
5. Then setup the viewpager using fragments and viewpager adapter.

6. Add OnNavigationItemSelectedListener for BottomNavigationView, and override OnNavigationItemSelected method with the relevant action.

7. Once done with the previous step add OnPageChangeListener to the ViewPager and override the PageSelected method. The magic happens here, the following code selects the relevant item in the BottomNavigationView.

<pre>
@Override
    public void onPageSelected(int position) {
        if (prevMenuItem != null) {
            prevMenuItem.setChecked(false);
        }
        else
        {
            bottomNavigationView.getMenu().getItem(0).setChecked(false);
        }
       
        bottomNavigationView.getMenu().getItem(position).setChecked(true);
        prevMenuItem = bottomNavigationView.getMenu().getItem(position);
    }
 </pre>

# About

This is a powerful twitter bot for discord. It allows you to follow up to 5000 Twitter users, track 400 words and 25 location boxes posting the content to as many Discord channels as you want. Furthermore you can customize which tweets to show.

[**Read the documentation**](http://nntin.github.io/discord-twitter-bot/about/)

# Installation

Installation can be quick and easy through Heroku (one-click deployment, [see video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwPcXBvStSI)). A multi-architecture Docker image is also provided for the Docker people.

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.png)](https://heroku.com/deploy)

Installations have been written for:

* [Ubuntu](http://nntin.github.io/discord-twitter-bot/docs/inst-ubuntu/)
* [Windows](http://nntin.github.io/discord-twitter-bot/docs/inst-windows/)
* [Mac OS](http://nntin.github.io/discord-twitter-bot/docs/inst-macos/)
* [Heroku](http://nntin.github.io/discord-twitter-bot/docs/inst-heroku/)
* [Docker](http://nntin.github.io/discord-twitter-bot/docs/inst-docker/)
* [Raspbian](http://nntin.github.io/discord-twitter-bot/docs/inst-raspbian/)

# Configuration

If you are using Heroku you already have a running bot. However it only supports a single Twitter feed.   
The [configuration page](http://nntin.github.io/discord-twitter-bot/docs/configuration/) gives you an insight how to configure your bot. 

The configuration is written very extensively explaining what each variable does. There are 2 ways to configure the bot. Either through [config.yml](http://nntin.github.io/discord-twitter-bot/docs/conf-config-yaml/) or through the use of [environment variables](http://nntin.github.io/discord-twitter-bot/docs/conf-environment-variable/).

# See it in action

## 套利原理

合约目前仅支持兼容 UniswapV2 接口的 AMM 之间套利。

假设我们要在 代币 TokenX 和代币 WETH 的交易对中套利，那么有交易对 TokenX/WETH：

- 这里的 WETH 称作 Base Token，它可以是任意代币，但必须是「有价值」的，例如 USDT/USDC/DAI/BUSD/WBNB... 等等
- 这里的 TokenX 称为 Quote Token，它可以是任意代币，即使毫无价值也没问题，因为套利结束后不会保留 Quote Token
- 套利结束后，只会保留 Base Token，即赚取的利润是以 Base Token 计价的
- 如果一个交易对中两个代币都可以作为 Base Token，那么会保留任意一个（随机）

套利使用 Uniswap v2 的 flashswap 功能，套利的流程为：

- 假设有交易对 Pair0 和 Pair1，只要他们之间有差价，就可以进行套利条件（抛开 gas 费的考虑）
- 调用合约开始套利
- 合约计算 Quote Token 的价格，假设 Pair0 中 Quote Token 价格较低，那么套利过程为：

1. 通过 flash swap ，从 Pair0 中借取数量为 x 的 Quote Token，此时我们产生了一笔负债，在交易结束前，我们需要向 Pair0 偿还数量为 y1 的 Base Token（借出 Token 和还入 Token 不同，这个是 Uni flash swap 的功能，只要保证交易对 k 值不变即可）
2. 将借来的 Quote Token 在 Pair1 中全部卖出，得到数量为 y2 的 Base Token
3. 向 Pair0 偿还 Base Token，数量为 y1
4. 交易结束，净利润为 y2 - y1

这里的关键点是计算需要借出的 Quote Token 数量，使得套利的收益最大化。

我们假设 Pair0 和 Pair1 的初始状态如下：

|                 | Pair0 | Pair1 |
| :---------------| :---- | :---- |
| Base Token 余额  | a1    |   a2  |
| Quote Token 余额 | b1    |   b2  |

那么有：

<img src=""https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\Delta&space;a_1&space;=&space;\frac{\Delta&space;b_1&space;\cdot&space;a_1}{b_1&space;-&space;\Delta&space;b_1}&space;\&space;\&space;\&space;\Delta&space;a_2&space;=&space;\frac{\Delta&space;b_2&space;\cdot&space;a_2}{b_2&space;&plus;&space;\Delta&space;b_2}"" title=""\Delta a_1 = \frac{\Delta b_1 \cdot a_1}{b_1 - \Delta b_1} \ \ \ \Delta a_2 = \frac{\Delta b_2 \cdot a_2}{b_2 + \Delta b_2}"" />

因为借出的 Quote Token 数量相同，即 `Delta b1` = `Delta b2`，我们令 `x = \Delta b`，那么利润与 x 关系的函数为：

<img src=""https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?f(x)&space;=&space;\Delta&space;a_2&space;-&space;\Delta&space;a_1&space;=&space;\frac&space;{a_2&space;\cdot&space;x}{b_2&plus;x}&space;-&space;\frac&space;{a_1&space;\cdot&space;x}{b_1-x}"" title=""f(x) = \Delta a_2 - \Delta a_1 = \frac {a_2 \cdot x}{b_2+x} - \frac {a_1 \cdot x}{b_1-x}"" />

我们需要求出当利润最大时 x 的值，此时 x 即为我们需要借出的 Quote Token 数量。先对上面的函数求导：

<img src=""https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?f'(x)&space;=&space;\frac{a_2b_2}{(b_2&plus;x)^2}&space;-&space;&space;\frac{a_1b_1}{(b_1-x)^2}"" title=""f'(x) = \frac{a_2b_2}{(b_2+x)^2} - \frac{a_1b_1}{(b_1-x)^2}"" />

导函数为 0 时，函数有极限值，我们可以通过一些条件设定，忽略极小值时的解。可以解出：

<img src=""https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\frac{a_2b_2}{(b_2&plus;x)^2}&space;-&space;&space;\frac{a_1b_1}{(b_1-x)^2}&space;=&space;0&space;"" title=""\frac{a_2b_2}{(b_2+x)^2} - \frac{a_1b_1}{(b_1-x)^2} = 0 "" />

<img src=""https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?(a_1b_1-a_2b_2)x^2&space;&plus;&space;2b_1b_2(a_1&plus;a_2)x&space;&plus;&space;b_1b_2(a_1b_2&space;-&space;a_2b_1)&space;=&space;0&space;"" title=""(a_1b_1-a_2b_2)x^2 + 2b_1b_2(a_1+a_2)x + b_1b_2(a_1b_2 - a_2b_1) = 0 "" />

我们可以令：

<img src=""https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\begin{cases}a&space;=&space;a_1b_1&space;-&space;a_2b_2&space;\\b&space;=&space;2b_1b_2(a_1&space;&plus;&space;a_2)&space;\\c&space;=&space;b_1b_2(a_1b_2&space;-&space;a_2b_1)\end{cases}&space;"" title=""\begin{cases}a = a_1b_1 - a_2b_2 \\b = 2b_1b_2(a_1 + a_2) \\c = b_1b_2(a_1b_2 - a_2b_1)\end{cases} "" />

那么前面的方程式化为一般的一元二次方程：

<img src=""https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?ax^2&plus;bx&plus;c=0&space;"" title=""ax^2+bx+c=0 "" />

解得：

<img src=""https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\begin{cases}x=\displaystyle&space;\frac{-b&space;\pm&space;\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}&space;\\0&space;<&space;x&space;<&space;b_1&space;\\x&space;<&space;b_2\end{cases}"" title=""\begin{cases}x=\displaystyle \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a} \\0 < x < b_1 \\x < b_2\end{cases}"" />

最后求出满足条件的 x 值，即为我们需要借贷的 Quote Token 数量。

## 部署合约
1. 编辑 `hardhat.config.ts` 中的网络配置。（目前都是 BSC 的地址）。

2. 拷贝私钥配置文件：

```bash
$ cp .secret.ts.sample .secret.ts
```

3. 填入部署账户的私钥和地址信息。运行脚本部署合约：


```bash
$ hardhat --network XXX run scripts/deploy.ts

```

## Bot

合约提供了 `getProfit(address pool1, address pool2)` 接口，可以计算出两个交易对之间套利的最大利润（以 Base Tokne计价）。

Bot 需要在多个 AMM DEX 的多个代币对之间，调用 `getProfit()` 查询利润，一但利润满足设定的阈值，即可调用 `flashArbitrage(pool1, pool2)` 进行套利，获得的收益将保存在合约中。

项目实现了 typescript 版本的 bot，运行方式：

```bash
$ yarn run bot
```

## BSC 上可套利的 DEX

- [PancakeSwap](https://pancakeswap.finance/)
- [MDEX](https://bsc.mdex.com/)
- [BakerySwap](https://www.bakeryswap.org/#/swap)
- [JulSwap](https://julswap.com/#/)
- [~~ValueDeFi~~](https://bsc.valuedefi.io/) （暂不支持）

## 运行 UT

```bash
$ hardhat test
```

- Slack Support using [webhooks](https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks)
- Twitter Support using the [tweepy](https://github.com/tweepy/tweepy) libary
- Email Support using [smtplib](https://docs.python.org/3/library/smtplib.html)
- Alert channels can be enabled or disabled in [`config.py`](https://github.com/fabston/TradingView-Webhook-Bot/blob/master/config.py)
- Dynamically send alerts to different Telegram and/or Discord channels
- TradingView `{{close}}`, `{{exchange}}` etc. variables support. Read more [here](https://www.tradingview.com/blog/en/introducing-variables-in-alerts-14880/)

> 💡 Got a feature idea? Open an [issue](https://github.com/fabston/TradingView-Webhook-Bot/issues/new?assignees=&labels=enhancement&template=feature-request---.md) and I might implement it.

## Installation
> ⚠️ Best to run the bot on a VPS. I can recommend <a href=""https://hetzner.cloud/?ref=tQ1NdT8zbfNY"" title=""Get €20 in cloud credits"">Hetzner</a>'s CX11 VPS for 2.89€/month. [Sign up](https://hetzner.cloud/?ref=tQ1NdT8zbfNY) now and receive **€20 free** credits.
1. Clone this repository `git clone https://github.com/fabston/TradingView-Webhook-Bot.git`
1. Create your virtual environment `python3 -m venv TradingView-Webhook-Bot`
1. Activate it `source TradingView-Webhook-Bot/bin/activate && cd TradingView-Webhook-Bot`
1. Install all requirements `pip install -r requirements.txt`
1. Edit and update [`config.py`](https://github.com/fabston/TradingView-Webhook-Bot/blob/master/config.py)
1. Setup TradingView alerts. An example alert message would be:
    ```json
    {
     ""key"": ""9T2q394M92"",
     ""telegram"": ""-1001277977502"",
     ""discord"": ""789842341870960670/BFeBBrCt-w2Z9RJ2wlH6TWUjM5bJuC29aJaJ5OQv9sE6zCKY_AlOxxFwRURkgEl852s3"",
     ""slack"": ""T00000000/B00000000/XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"",
     ""msg"": ""Long *#{{ticker}}* at `{{close}}`""
    }
    ```
    - `key` is mandatory! It has to match with `sec_key` in [`config.py`](https://github.com/fabston/TradingView-Webhook-Bot/blob/master/config.py). It's an extra security measurement to ensure nobody else is executing your alerts
    - `telegram`, `discord`, `slack` is optional. If it is not set it will fall back to the config.py settings
    - `msg` can be anything. Markdown for [Telegram](https://core.telegram.org/api/entities) and [Discord](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/210298617-Markdown-Text-101-Chat-Formatting-Bold-Italic-Underline-) is supported as well
        - TradingViews variables like `{{close}}`, `{{exchange}}` etc. work too. More can be found [here](https://www.tradingview.com/blog/en/introducing-variables-in-alerts-14880/)
    - Your webhook url would be `http://<YOUR-IP>/webhook`
1. If you use a firewall be sure to open the corresponding port
1. Run the bot with `python main.py`
1. [PM2](https://github.com/fabston/TradingView-Webhook-Bot/issues/28#issuecomment-766301062) can help you in running the app in the background / on system boot. 

### Docker
1. Clone this repository `git clone https://github.com/fabston/TradingView-Webhook-Bot.git`
1. Edit and update [`config.py`](https://github.com/fabston/TradingView-Webhook-Bot/blob/master/config.py)
1. `docker-compose build`
1. `docker-compose up`

*It is recommended to run flask on a different port like 8080. It is then necessary to forward port 80 to 8080.*

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<p>Uses <a href=""http://github.com/dominictarr/JSON.sh"">JSON.sh</a>/<a href=""https://github.com/step-/JSON.awk"">JSON.awk</a> and the magic of sed.</p>
<p>Bashbot is written in bash. It depends on commands typically available in a Linux/Unix Environment. For more information on commands provided by recent versions of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_GNU_Core_Utilities_commands"">coreutils</a>, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BusyBox#Commands"">busybox</a> or <a href=""https://landley.net/toybox/help.html"">toybox</a>, see <a href=""doc/7_develop.md#common-commands"">Developer Notes</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note for MacOS and BSD Users:</strong> Bashbot will not run without installing additional software as it uses modern bash and (gnu) grep/sed features. See <a href=""doc/0_install.md"">Install Bashbot</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note for embedded systems:</strong> You need to install a ""real"" bash as the vanilla installation of busybox or toybox is not sufficient. See <a href=""doc/0_install.md"">Install Bashbot</a>.</p>

<h3>Your very first bashbot in a nutshell</h3>
<p>To install and run bashbot you need access to a Linux/Unix command line with bash, a <a href=""https://telegram.org"">Telegram client</a> and a mobile phone <a href=""https://telegramguide.com/create-a-telegram-account/"">with a Telegram account</a>.</p>
<p>First you need to <a href=""doc/1_firstbot.md"">create a new Telegram Bot token</a> for your bot and write it down.</p>
<p>Now open a Linux/Unix terminal with bash, create a new directory, change to it and install telegram-bot-bash:</p>
<div class=""sourceCode"" id=""cb1""><pre class=""sourceCode bash""><code class=""sourceCode bash""><span id=""cb1-1""><a href=""#cb1-1""></a><span class=""co""># create bot dir</span></span>

<span id=""cb1-22""><a href=""#cb1-22""></a><span class=""ex"">Bot</span> started successfully.</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now open the Telegram App on your mobile phone and start a chat with your bot (<em>your bot's username is shown after 'Bot Name:'</em>):</p>
<pre><code>/start

You are Botadmin
Available commands:
  /start: _Start bot and get this message_.
  /help: _Get this message_.
  /info: _Get shorter info message about this bot_....

/info

This is bashbot, the Telegram bot written entirely in bash.
It features background tasks and interactive chats, and can serve as an interface for CLI programs.
</code></pre>
<p>For more Information on how to install, customize and use your new bot, read the <a href=""#Documentation"">Documentation</a>.</p>
<h3>Log files</h3>
<p>Bashbot actions are logged to <code>BASHBOT.log</code>. Telegram send/receive errors are logged to <code>ERROR.log</code>. Start bashbot in debug mode to see all messages sent to / received from Telegram, as well as bash command error messages.</p>
<p>To enable debug mode, start bashbot with debug as third argument: <code>bashbot start debug</code></p>
<pre><code>|__ logs
|     |__ BASHBOT.log  # log what your bot is doing ...
|     |__ ERROR.log    # connection errors from / to Telegram API
|     |
|     |__ DEBUG.log    # stdout/stderr of you bot (debug mode enabled)
|     |__ MESSAGE.log  # full text of all message send/received (debug mode enabled)
</code></pre>
<hr />
<h2>Security Considerations</h2>
<p>Running a Telegram Bot means it is connected to the public and you never know what's send to your Bot.</p>
<p>Bash scripts in general are not designed to be bulletproof, so consider this Bot as a proof of concept. Bash programmers often struggle with 'quoting hell' and globbing, see <a href=""https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/171346/security-implications-of-forgetting-to-quote-a-variable-in-bash-posix-shells"">Implications of wrong quoting</a>.</p>
<p>Whenever you are processing input from untrusted sources (messages, files, network) you must be as careful as possible (e.g. set IFS appropriately, disable globbing with <code>set -f</code> and quote everything). In addition remove unused scripts and examples from your Bot (e.g. everything in <code>example/</code>) and disable/remove all unused bot commands.</p>
<p>It's important to escape or remove <code>$</code> and ` in input from user, files or network (<em>as bashbot does</em>). One of the powerful features of Unix shells is variable and command substitution using <code>${var}</code>, <code>$(cmd)</code> and `cmd` can lead to remote code execution (RCE) or remote information disclosure (RID) bugs if unescaped <code>$</code> or ` is included in untrusted input (e.g. <code>$$</code> or <code>$(rm -rf /*)</code>).</p>
<p>A powerful tool to improve your scripts is <code>shellcheck</code>. You can <a href=""https://www.shellcheck.net/"">use it online</a> or <a href=""https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck#installing"">install shellcheck locally</a>. Shellcheck is used extensively in bashbot development to ensure a high code quality (e.g. it's not allowed to push changes without passing all shellcheck tests). In addition bashbot has a <a href=""doc/7_develop.md"">test suite</a> to check if important functionality is working as expected.</p>
<h3>Use printf whenever possible</h3>
<p>If you're writing a script that accepts external input (e.g. from the user as arguments or the file system), you shouldn't use echo to display it. <a href=""https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/6581"">Use printf whenever possible</a>.</p>
<h3>Run your Bot as a restricted user</h3>
<p><strong>I recommend running your bot as a user with almost no access rights.</strong> All files your Bot has write access to are in danger of being overwritten/deleted if your bot is hacked. For the same reason every file your Bot can read is in danger of being disclosed. Restrict your Bots access rights to the absolute minimum.</p>
<p><strong>Never run your Bot as root, this is the most dangerous you can do!</strong> Usually the user 'nobody' has almost no rights on Linux/Unix systems. See <a href=""doc/4_expert.md"">Expert use</a> on how to run your Bot as an other user.</p>
<h3>Secure your Bot installation</h3>
<p><strong>Your Bot configuration must not be readable by other users.</strong> Everyone who can read your Bots token is able to act as your Bot and has access to all chats the Bot is in!</p>
<p>Everyone with read access to your Bot files can extract your Bots data. Especially your Bot config in <code>config.jssh</code> must be protected against other users. No one except you should have write access to the Bot files. The Bot should be restricted to have write access to <code>count.jssh</code>, <code>data-bot-bash/</code> and <code>logs/</code> only, all other files must be write protected.</p>
<p>To set access rights for your bashbot installation to a reasonable default run <code>sudo ./bashbot.sh init</code> after every update or change to your installation directory.</p>
<p><em>Note</em>: Keep old log files in a safe place or even better delete them, they are GDPR relevant and <a href=""https://github.com/topkecleon/telegram-bot-bash/issues/174"">may contain information</a> you don't want to be public.</p>
<h2>FAQ</h2>
<h3>Is this Bot insecure?</h3>
<p>Bashbot is not more (in)secure than a Bot written in another language. We have done our best to make it as secure as possible. But YOU are responsible for the bot commands you wrote and you should know about the risks ...</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Up to version 0.941 (mai/22/2020) telegram-bot-bash had a remote code execution bug, please update if you use an older version!</p>
<h3>Why Bash and not the much better xyz?</h3>
<p>Well, that's a damn good question... maybe because I'm a Unix admin from the stone age. Nevertheless there are more reasons from my side:</p>
<ul>
<li>bashbot will run wherever bash and (gnu) sed is available, from embedded Linux to mainframe</li>
<li>easy to integrate with other shell scripts, e.g. for sending system message / health status</li>
<li>no need to install or learn a new programming language, library or framework</li>
<li>no database, not event driven, not object oriented ...</li>
</ul>
<h3>Can I have the single bashbot.sh file back?</h3>
<p>At the beginning bashbot was simply the file <code>bashbot.sh</code> that you could copy everywhere and run the bot. Now we have 'commands.sh', 'mycommands.sh', 'modules/*.sh' and much more.</p>
<p>Hey no problem, if you are finished with your cool bot, run <code>dev/make-standalone.sh</code> to create a stripped down version of your bot containing only 'bashbot.sh' and 'commands.sh'! For more information see <a href=""doc/7_develop.md"">Create a stripped down version of your Bot</a>.</p>
<h3>Can I send messages from CLI and scripts?</h3>
<p>Of course you can send messages from command line and scripts! Simply install bashbot as <a href=""#Your-really-first-bashbot-in-a-nutshell"">described here</a>, send the message '/start' to set yourself as botadmin and then stop the bot with <code>./bashbot.sh stop</code>.</p>
<p>Bashbot provides some ready to use scripts for sending messages from command line in <code>bin/</code> dir, e.g. <code>send_message.sh</code>.</p>
<div class=""sourceCode"" id=""cb4""><pre class=""sourceCode bash""><code class=""sourceCode bash""><span id=""cb4-1""><a href=""#cb4-1""></a><span class=""ex"">bin/send_message.sh</span> BOTADMIN <span class=""st"">&quot;This is my first message send from CLI&quot;</span></span>
<span id=""cb4-2""><a href=""#cb4-2""></a></span>
<span id=""cb4-3""><a href=""#cb4-3""></a><span class=""ex"">bin/send_message.sh</span> --help</span></code></pre></div>
<p>You can also source bashbot for use in your scripts, for more information see <a href=""doc/4_expert.md"">Expert Use</a>.</p>
<h3>Blocked by telegram?</h3>
<p>This may happen if too many or wrong requests are sent to api.telegram.org, e.g. using a invalid token or invalid API calls. If the block stay for longer time you can ask telegram service to unblock your IP-Address.</p>
<p>You can check with curl or wget if you are blocked by Telegram:</p>
<div class=""sourceCode"" id=""cb5""><pre class=""sourceCode bash""><code class=""sourceCode bash""><span id=""cb5-1""><a href=""#cb5-1""></a><span class=""ex"">curl</span> -m 10  https://api.telegram.org/bot</span>
<span id=""cb5-2""><a href=""#cb5-2""></a><span class=""co"">#curl: (28) Connection timed out after 10001 milliseconds</span></span>
<span id=""cb5-3""><a href=""#cb5-3""></a></span>
<span id=""cb5-4""><a href=""#cb5-4""></a><span class=""fu"">wget</span> -t 1 -T 10 https://api.telegram.org/bot</span>
<span id=""cb5-5""><a href=""#cb5-5""></a><span class=""co"">#Connecting to api.telegram.org (api.telegram.org)|46.38.243.234|:443... failed: Connection timed out.</span></span>
<span id=""cb5-6""><a href=""#cb5-6""></a></span>
<span id=""cb5-7""><a href=""#cb5-7""></a><span class=""ex"">nc</span> -w 2 api.telegram.org 443 <span class=""kw"">||</span> <span class=""bu"">echo</span> <span class=""st"">&quot;your IP seems blocked by telegram&quot;</span></span>
<span id=""cb5-8""><a href=""#cb5-8""></a><span class=""co"">#your IP seems blocked by telegram</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Bashbot offers the option to recover from broken connections (blocked). Therefore you can provide a function named <code>bashbotBlockRecover()</code> in <code>mycommands.sh</code>, the function is called every time when a broken connection is detected.</p>
<p>Possible actions are: Check if network is working, change IP-Address or simply wait some time. See <code>mycommnds.sh.dist</code> for an example.</p>

Tools for developing Telegram bots. Best used with Rails, but can be used in
[standalone app](https://github.com/telegram-bot-rb/telegram-bot/wiki/Not-rails-application).
Supposed to be used in webhook-mode in production, and poller-mode
in development, but you can use poller in production if you want.

Package contains:

- Lightweight client for bot API (with fast and thread-safe
  [httpclient](https://github.com/nahi/httpclient) under the hood).
- Controller with message parser: define methods for commands, not `case` branches.
- Middleware and routes helpers for production env.
- Poller with automatic source-reloader for development env.
- Rake tasks to update webhook urls.
- __[Async mode](#async-mode)__.
  Let the queue adapter handle network errors!

Here is sample [telegram_bot_app](https://github.com/telegram-bot-rb/telegram_bot_app)
with session, keyboards and inline queries.
Run it on your local machine in 1 minute!

And here is [app template](https://github.com/telegram-bot-rb/rails_template)
to generate new rails app in seconds.

See examples and cookbook in [the wiki](https://github.com/telegram-bot-rb/telegram-bot/wiki).

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'telegram-bot'
```

And then execute:

```
bundle
```

Or install it yourself as:

```
gem install telegram-bot
```

Require if necessary:

```ruby
require 'telegram/bot'
```

## Usage

### Configuration

While clients can be instantiated explicitly, there is `Telegram.bots_config=` method
to configure app-wide clients, which are accessible via `Telegram.bots`.
It accepts hash of `{bot_id: bot_config}`, and there is special id `:default`
which is used for `Telegram.bot`.

```ruby
Telegram.bots_config = {
  default: DEFAULT_BOT_TOKEN,
  chat: {
    token: CHAT_BOT_TOKEN,
    username: 'ChatBot', # to support commands with mentions (/help@ChatBot)
    server: 'http://local.bot.api.server', # for Local Bot API Server
  },
}

Telegram.bot.get_updates
Telegram.bot == Telegram.bots[:default] # true
Telegram.bots[:chat].send_message(...)
```

### Configuration in Rails app

In Rails app `Telegram.bots_config` is read from `secrets.yml` automatically
from `telegram` section:

```yml
development:
  telegram:
    # Single bot can be specified like this
    bot: TOKEN
    # or
    bot:
      token: TOKEN
      username: SomeBot
      server: http://local.bot.api.server

    # For multiple bots in single app use hash of `internal_bot_id => settings`
    bots:
      # just set the bot token
      chat: TOKEN_1
      # or add username to support commands with mentions (/help@ChatBot)
      auction:
        token: TOKEN_2
        username: ChatBot
```

For Rails >= 5.2 `Telegram::Bot` searches for config first in credentials and then in secrets.
To use credentials as config store, add telegram section to credentials instead of secrets using
`rails credentials:edit`. In this case be aware of that [Rails < 6.0 may not load
credentials in dev environment by default](https://github.com/telegram-bot-rb/telegram-bot/issues/74#issuecomment-384205609).
In Rails >= 6.0 run `rails credentials:edit --environment development` to configure bot
in each environment.

I suggest not using Rails 5.2 credentials because it can lead to leakage of sensitive data
and it's more difficult to use in multiple environments. See
[secure_credentials](https://github.com/printercu/secure_credentials) gem for better option.

From now clients will be accessible with `Telegram.bots[:chat]` or `Telegram.bots[:auction]`.
Single bot can be accessed with `Telegram.bot` or `Telegram.bots[:default]`.

### Client

Client is instantiated with `Telegram::Bot::Client.new(token, username)`.
Username is optional and used only to parse commands with mentions.

There is `request(path_suffix, body)` method to perform any query.
And there are shortcuts for all available requests in underscored style
(`answer_inline_query(params)` instead of `answerInlineQuery`).

```ruby
bot.request(:getMe) or bot.get_me
bot.request(:getupdates, offset: 1) or bot.get_updates(offset: 1)
bot.send_message(chat_id: chat_id, text: 'Test')
```

There is no magic, they just pass params as is and set `path_suffix`.
See [list of available methods](https://github.com/telegram-bot-rb/telegram-bot/blob/master/lib/telegram/bot/client/api_methods.txt)
fetched from [API docs](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api).
Please open PR or issue if it misses methods from new API versions.

Any API request error will raise `Telegram::Bot::Error` with description in its message.
Special `Telegram::Bot::Forbidden` is raised when bot can't post messages to the chat anymore.

#### Typed responses

By default client will return parsed json responses. You can enable
response typecasting to virtus models using
[`telegram-bot-types`](https://github.com/telegram-bot-rb/telegram-bot-types) gem:

```ruby
# Add to your gemfile:
gem 'telegram-bot-types', '~> x.x.x'
# Enable typecasting:
Telegram::Bot::Client.typed_response!
# or for single instance:
bot.extend Telegram::Bot::Client::TypedResponse

bot.get_me.class # => Telegram::Bot::Types::User
```

### Controller

Controller makes it easy to keep bot's code readable.
It does nothing more than finding out action name for update and invoking it.
So there is almost no overhead comparing to large `switch`, while you
can represent actions as separate methods keeping source much more readable and supportable.

New instance of controller is instantiated for each update.
This way every update is processed in isolation from others.

Bot controllers like usual rails controllers provides features like callbacks,
`rescue_from` and instrumentation.

```ruby
class Telegram::WebhookController < Telegram::Bot::UpdatesController
  # use callbacks like in any other controller
  around_action :with_locale

  # Every update has one of: message, inline_query, chosen_inline_result,
  # callback_query, etc.
  # Define method with the same name to handle this type of update.
  def message(message)
    # store_message(message['text'])
  end

  # For the following types of updates commonly used params are passed as arguments,
  # full payload object is available with `payload` instance method.
  #
  #   message(payload)
  #   inline_query(query, offset)
  #   chosen_inline_result(result_id, query)
  #   callback_query(data)

  # Define public methods ending with `!` to handle commands.
  # Command arguments will be parsed and passed to the method.
  # Be sure to use splat args and default values to not get errors when
  # someone passed more or less arguments in the message.
  def start!(word = nil, *other_words)
    # do_smth_with(word)

    # full message object is also available via `payload` instance method:
    # process_raw_message(payload['text'])

    # There are `chat` & `from` shortcut methods.
    # For callback queries `chat` is taken from `message` when it's available.
    response = from ? ""Hello #{from['username']}!"" : 'Hi there!'

    # There is `respond_with` helper to set `chat_id` from received message:
    respond_with :message, text: response

    # `reply_with` also sets `reply_to_message_id`:
    reply_with :photo, photo: File.open('party.jpg')
  end

  private

  def with_locale(&block)
    I18n.with_locale(locale_for_update, &block)
  end

  def locale_for_update
    if from
      # locale for user
    elsif chat
      # locale for chat
    end
  end
end
```

#### Reply helpers

There are helpers for basic responses. They just set chat/message/query
identifiers from the update. See
[`ReplyHelpers`](https://github.com/telegram-bot-rb/telegram-bot/blob/master/lib/telegram/bot/updates_controller/reply_helpers.rb)
module for more information. Here are these methods signatures:

```ruby
def respond_with(type, params); end
def reply_with(type, params); end
def answer_inline_query(results, params = {}); end
def answer_callback_query(text, params = {}); end
def edit_message(type, params = {}); end
def answer_pre_checkout_query(ok, params = {}); end
def answer_shipping_query(ok, params = {}); end
```

#### Optional typecasting

You can enable typecasting of `update` with `telegram-bot-types` by including
`Telegram::Bot::UpdatesController::TypedUpdate`:

```ruby
class Telegram::WebhookController < Telegram::Bot::UpdatesController
  include Telegram::Bot::UpdatesController::TypedUpdate

  def message(message)
    message.class # => Telegram::Bot::Types::Message
  end
end
```

#### Session

This API is very close to ActiveController's session API, but works different
under the hood. Cookies can not be used to store session id or
whole session (like CookieStore does). So it uses key-value store and `session_key`
method to build identifier from update.

Store can be one of numerous `ActiveSupport::Cache` stores.
While `:file_store` is suitable for development and single-server deployments
without heavy load, it doesn't scale well. Key-value databases with persistance
like Redis are more appropriate for production use.

```ruby
# In rails app store can be configured in env files:
config.telegram_updates_controller.session_store = :redis_store, {expires_in: 1.month}

# In other app it can be done for all controllers with:
Telegram::Bot::UpdatesController.session_store = :redis_store, {expires_in: 1.month}
# or for specific one:
OneOfUpdatesController.session_store = :redis_store, {expires_in: 1.month}
```

Default session id is made from bot's username and `(from || chat)['id']`.
It means that session will be the same for updates from user in every chat,
and different for every user in the same group chat.
To change this behavior you can override `session_key` method, or even
define [multiple sessions](https://github.com/telegram-bot-rb/telegram-bot/wiki/Multiple-session-objects)
in single controller. For details see `Session` module.

```ruby
class Telegram::WebhookController < Telegram::Bot::UpdatesController
  include Telegram::Bot::UpdatesController::Session
  # or just shortcut:
  use_session!

  # You can override global config for this controller.
  self.session_store = :file_store

  def write!(text = nil, *)
    session[:text] = text
  end

  def read!(*)
    respond_with :message, text: session[:text]
  end

  private

  # In this case session will persist for user only in specific chat.
  # Same user in other chat will have different session.
  def session_key
    ""#{bot.username}:#{chat['id']}:#{from['id']}"" if chat && from
  end
end
```

#### Message context

It's usual to support chain of messages like BotFather: after receiving command
it asks you for additional argument. There is `MessageContext` for this:

```ruby
class Telegram::WebhookController < Telegram::Bot::UpdatesController
  include Telegram::Bot::UpdatesController::MessageContext

  def rename!(*)
    # set context for the next message
    save_context :rename_from_message
    respond_with :message, text: 'What name do you like?'
  end

  # register context handlers to handle this context
  def rename_from_message(*words)
    update_name words[0]
    respond_with :message, text: 'Renamed!'
  end

  # You can use same action name as context name:
  def rename!(name = nil, *)
    if name
      update_name name
      respond_with :message, text: 'Renamed!'
    else
      save_context :rename!
      respond_with :message, text: 'What name do you like?'
    end
  end
end
```

#### Callback queries

You can include `CallbackQueryContext` module to split `#callback_query` into
several methods. It doesn't require session support, and takes context from
data: if data has a prefix with colon like this `my_ctx:smth...` it invokes
`my_ctx_callback_query('smth...')` when such action method is defined. Otherwise
it invokes `callback_query('my_ctx:smth...')` as usual.
Callback queries without prefix stay untouched.

```ruby
# This one handles `set_value:%{something}`.
def set_value_callback_query(new_value = nil, *)
  save_this(value)
  answer_callback_query('Saved!')
end

# And this one is for `make_cool:%{something}`
def make_cool_callback_query(thing = nil, *)
  do_it(thing)
  answer_callback_query(""#{thing} is cool now! Like a callback query context."")
end
```

### Routes in Rails app

There is `telegram_webhook` helper for rails app to define routes for webhooks.
It defines routes at `telegram/#{hash_of(bot.token)}` and connects bots with controller.

```ruby
# Most off apps would require
telegram_webhook TelegramController
# which is same as
telegram_webhook TelegramController, :default

# Use different controllers for each bot:
telegram_webhook TelegramChatController, :chat
telegram_webhook TelegramAuctionController, :auction

# Defined route is named and its name depends on `Telegram.bots`.
# For single bot it will use 'telegram_webhook',
# for multiple bots it uses bot's key in the `Telegram.bots` as prefix
# (eg. `chat_telegram_webhook`).
# You can override this with `as` option:
telegram_webhook TelegramController, as: :custom_telegram_webhook
```

#### Processing updates

To process update with controller call `.dispatch(bot, update)` on it.
There are several options to run it automatically:

- Use webhooks with routes helper (described above).
- Use `Telegram::Bot::Middleware` with rack ([example in wiki](https://github.com/telegram-bot-rb/telegram-bot/wiki/Not-rails-application)).
- Use poller (described in the next section).

To run action without update (ex., send notifications from jobs),
you can call `#process` directly. In this case controller can be initialized
with `:from` and/or `:chat` options instead of `update` object:

```ruby
controller = ControllerClass.new(bot, from: telegram_user, chat: telegram_chat)
controller.process(:welcome, *args)
```

### Development & Debugging

Use `rake telegram:bot:poller` to run poller in rails app. It automatically loads
changes without restart in development env.
Optionally pass bot id in `BOT` envvar (`BOT=chat`) to specify bot to run poller for.

This task requires `telegram_webhook` helper to be used as it connects bots with controller.
To run poller in other cases use:

```ruby
Telegram::Bot::UpdatesPoller.start(bot, controller_class)
```

### Testing

There is a `Telegram::Bot::ClientStub` class to stub client for tests.
Instead of performing API requests it stores them in a `requests` hash.

To stub all possible clients use `Telegram::Bot::ClientStub.stub_all!` before
initializing clients. Here is a template for RSpec:

```ruby
# environments/test.rb
# Make sure to run it before defining routes or accessing any bot in the app!
Telegram.reset_bots
Telegram::Bot::ClientStub.stub_all!

# rails_helper.rb
RSpec.configure do |config|
  # ...
  config.after { Telegram.bot.reset }
  # or for multiple bots:
  config.after { Telegram.bots.each_value(&:reset) }
  # ...
end
```

RSpec contexts and helpers are included automatically for groups and examples with matching
tags. In RSpec < 3.4 it's required to use `include_context` explicitly.
See [list of available helpers](https://github.com/telegram-bot-rb/telegram-bot/tree/master/lib/telegram/bot/rspec)
for details.

There are 3 types of integration tests:

- `:rails` - for testing bot in webhooks-mode in Rails application.
  It simulates webhook requests POSTing data to controller's endpoint.
  It works on the top of requests specs, so `rspec-rails` gem is required.
- `:rack` - For testing bot in webhooks-mode in non-Rails application.
  It uses `rack-test` gem to POST requests to bot's endpoint.
- `:poller` - Calls `.dispatch` directly on controller class.

Pick the appropriate one, then require `telegram/bot/rspec/integration/#{type}`
and mark spec group with tag `telegram_bot: type`. See configuration options
for each type in
[telegram/bot/rspec/integration/](https://github.com/telegram-bot-rb/telegram-bot/tree/master/lib/telegram/bot/rspec/integration).

Here is an example test for a Rails app:

```ruby
# spec/requests/telegram_webhooks_spec.rb
require 'telegram/bot/rspec/integration/rails'

RSpec.describe TelegramWebhooksController, telegram_bot: :rails do
  # for old RSpec:
  # include_context 'telegram/bot/integration/rails'

  # Main method is #dispatch(update). Some helpers are:
  #   dispatch_message(text, options = {})
  #   dispatch_command(cmd, *args)

  # Available matchers can be found in Telegram::Bot::RSpec::ClientMatchers.
  it 'shows usage of basic matchers' do
    # The most basic one is #make_telegram_request(bot, action).
    # It works similar to `receive` matcher and supports chaining `.with(args).exactly(n).times`.
    expect { dispatch_command(:start) }.to make_telegram_request(bot, :sendMessage).
      with(hash_including(text: 'msg text'))

    # There are some shortcuts for dispatching basic updates and testing responses.
    expect { dispatch_message('Hi') }.to send_telegram_message(bot, /msg regexp/, some: :option)
  end

  describe '#start!' do
    subject { -> { dispatch_command :start } }
    # Using built in matcher for `respond_to`:
    it { should respond_with_message 'Hi there!' }
  end

  # There is context for callback queries with related matchers,
  # use :callback_query tag to include it.
  describe '#hey_callback_query', :callback_query do
    let(:data) { ""hey:#{name}"" }
    let(:name) { 'Joe' }
    it { should answer_callback_query('Hey Joe') }
    it { should edit_current_message :text, text: 'Done' }
  end
end
```

There is a context for testing bot controller in the way similar to Rails controller tests.
It's supposed to be a low-level alternative for integration tests. Among the differences is
that controller tests use a single controller instance for all dispatches in specific example,
session is stubbed (does not use configured store engine), and update is not serialized
so it also supports mocks. This can be useful for unit testing, but should not be used as
the default way to test the bot.

```ruby
require 'telegram/bot/updates_controller/rspec_helpers'
RSpec.describe TelegramWebhooksController, type: :telegram_bot_controller do
  # for old RSpec:
  # include_context 'telegram/bot/updates_controller'

  # Same helpers and matchers like dispatch_command, answer_callback_query are available here.
end
```

See sample app for more examples.

### Deployment

While webhooks-mode is prefered, poller still can be used in production.
See [comparison and examples](https://github.com/telegram-bot-rb/telegram-bot/wiki/Deployment)
for details.

### Async mode

There is built in support for async requests using ActiveJob. Without Rails
you can implement your own worker class to handle such requests. This allows:

- Process updates very fast, without waiting for telegram responses.
- Handle and retry network and other errors with queue adapter.
- ???

Instead of performing request instantly client serializes it, pushes to queue,
and immediately return control back. The job is then fetched with a worker
and real API request is performed. And this all is absolutely transparent for the app.

To enable this mode add `async: true` to bot's config.
For more information and custom configuration check out
[docs](http://www.rubydoc.info/github/telegram-bot-rb/telegram-bot/master/Telegram/Bot/Async) or
[source](https://github.com/telegram-bot-rb/telegram-bot/blob/master/lib/telegram/bot/async.rb).

If you want async mode, but don't want to setup queue, know that Rails 5 are shipped
with Async adapter by default, and there is
[Sucker Punch](https://github.com/brandonhilkert/sucker_punch) for Rails 4.

To disable async mode for the block of code use `bot.async(false) { bot.send_photo }`.
Yes, it's threadsafe too.

#### Limitations

- Client will not return API response.
- Sending files is not available in async mode, because they can not be serialized.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies and git hooks.
Then, run `appraisal rake spec` to run the tests.
You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`.
To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`,
and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version,
push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).

Use `bin/fetch-telegram-methods` to update API methods list from Telegram website.

This is my personal project of a BOT to play the game [Splinterlands](https://www.splinterlands.com). It requires [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/it/download/) installed to run.


## How to start the BOT:

REQUIREMENT: You need to install NodeJS from https://nodejs.org/en/download/ (at least the last stable version 14.18.0)

Once NodeJS is installed and you downloaded the bot in a specific folder, you need to set your configuration in the .env file:

you need to create the .env file and include the username and posting key (file with no name, only starting dot to create a hidden file) in the bot folder, 

Example: 

- `ACCOUNT=youraccountname`
- `PASSWORD=yourpostingkey`

You can also use the file `.env-example` as a template, but remember to remove `-example` from the filename.

__IMPORTANT:__ the bot needs the __username and posting key__ in order to login. __Don't use the email and password__. If you don't have the posting key, you need to _'Request Keys'_ from the top right menu in Splinterlands. You will receive a link to follow where you will get your Hive private keys. __Store them safely and don't share them with anyone!__  

Once the file is created, open cmd (for windows) or terminal (for Mac and Linux) and run:

`npm install`

and then

`npm start`

There is also a youtube video made by a user that can help windows users with the setup [here](https://youtu.be/MFxV6XeDKec)


If you face issue related to the browser when you run the bot for the first time, be sure you have installed chromium browser. For Linux:
#### install chromium
sudo apt-get install chromium-browser

#### run this if running chromium still fails
sudo apt-get install libpangocairo-1.0-0 libx11-xcb1 libxcomposite1 libxcursor1 libxdamage1 libxi6 libxtst6 libnss3 libcups2 libxss1 libxrandr2 libgconf2-4 libasound2 libatk1.0-0 libgtk-3-0 libgbm-dev



### Optional variables:

The BOT will make a battle every 30 minutes by default, you can change the custom value specifying in the .env the variable `MINUTES_BATTLES_INTERVAL`.
The BOT will also try to select team to complete the daily quest by default. If you want to remove this option to increase the winning rate, you can set the variable `QUEST_PRIORITY` as false.
By default, the BOT doesn't check for season rewards but it can automatically click on the seasons reward claim button if available and the `CLAIM_SEASON_REWARD` is set to true. The default option is false.
By default, the BOT checks automatically for daily quest rewards but the claim option can be deactivated with the option `CLAIM_DAILY_QUEST_REWARD` is set to false. The default option is true.
By default, the BOT will run as headless. Set `HEADLESS` to false to see your browser. The default option is true
By default, the BOT will run no matter the ECR level. Set `ECR_STOP_LIMIT` to a specific value you want the bot to rest and recover the ECR. The bot will recover until the `ECR_RECOVER_TO` is reached or until 100% ECR.
If you want the bot to play only one color (when it's possible), use the variable `FAVOURITE_DECK`  and specify the splinter by choosing only one among: fire, life, earth, water, death, dragon. 
If you want the bot to try to skip specific quest types you can include multiple quest in the variable `SKIP_QUEST` separated by the comma (`SKIP_QUEST=life,snipe,neutral`). whenever it's possible, the bot will click to ask for a new one. Remember you can only ask for a new one once based on the game rules.
If you want the bot to prioritize teams that uses delegated cards, set the variable `DELEGATED_CARDS_PRIORITY`  equal to `true`.

Example:

- `QUEST_PRIORITY=false`

- `MINUTES_BATTLES_INTERVAL=30`

- `CLAIM_SEASON_REWARD=true`

- `CLAIM_DAILY_QUEST_REWARD=false`

- `HEADLESS=false`

- `ECR_STOP_LIMIT=50`

- `ECR_RECOVER_TO=99`

- `FAVOURITE_DECK=dragon`

- `SKIP_QUEST=life,snipe,neutral`

- `DELEGATED_CARDS_PRIORITY=true`


### Running bot with multiaccount setting

in order to run multple accounts launching the script only once, you can simply add the list of usernames and posting keys in the .env file and set the variable `MULTI_ACCOUNT` as true:

- `MULTI_ACCOUNT=true`
- `ACCOUNT=user1,user2,user,...`
- `PASSWORD=postingkey1,postingkey2,postingkey3,...`

### Running bot as a daemon with PM2

To run your bot as a daemon (background process) you can use NPM package PM2. PM2 is daemon process manager, that works on Linux, MacOS, and Windows. To install PM2 globally, you need to run:

# `npm install pm2 -g`

To start a bot, do all the preparation steps from the above, but instead of `npm start`, run this:

`pm2 start main.js`

You can now run `pm2 list` command to see your bot up and running. It will automatically start on system startup now. You can control the bot with these commands:

`pm2 start <id>`

`pm2 stop <id>`

`pm2 restart <id>`

`pm2 delete <id>`

You can find more information on PM2 usage options at their [official webiste](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/).


### Running the bot in a docker container

docker instructions:

1. first, you need to install docker https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/
2. open your terminal/command line
3. cd into your bot directory
4. build the image
-> `docker build -t your_image_name -f Dockerfile .`
5. then run a container based on the image
-> `docker run -it your_image_name bash`
6. the 5th step will get you inside your container, use nano or vim to edit your .env file and make sure to uncomment CHROME_EXEC
7. finally, run
-> `npm start`



## Local History backup (battlesGetData.js)

The BOT leverages an API on a free server but in case the traffic is heavy or it doesn't work, it is possible to have locally an history as a backup solution that the bot will read automatically.
To generate the file 'history.json' with a unique array with the history of the battles of an array of users specified in the file.

[ OPTIONAL ] run this command from the terminal:

`node battlesGetData.js`

Once the script is done, it will create a file 'history.json' in the data folder. To makes the bot using it, you have to rename it in: 'newHistory.json' 

**How to get history data from users of my choice?**

1. Open battlesGetData.js in notepad and change the usersToGrab on line 69 to the users of your choice
2. Run `node battlesGetData.js` in the bot folder
3. File history.json is created, rename it to newHistory.json to replace the existing history data OR extend the newHistory.json file (see below)

**How to extend the newHistory.json without deleting existing data?**

1. Backup newHistory.json in case something goes wrong
2. Inside the data folder, run `node combine.js` in the data folder to add the data from history.json to the newHistory.json file


# FAQ


Q: Can I make the bot running a battle every 2 minutes?
A: Technically yes, but playing too often will decrease the Capture Rate making the rewards very low and insignificant. Try to play a battle every 20 minutes MAX to maintain high level of rewards. Trust me, you keep the ROI higher. Don't be greedy.

Q: Does it play for the daily quest?
A: At the moment the bot consider only the splinters quests (death, dragon, earth, fire, life, water) but not the special one (snipe, sneak, neutral,...). Therefore yes, the bot prioritize the splinter for the quest. Nonetheless if the bot consider more probable to win a battle with another splinter (because for example there are not many possible team for the splinter of the quest), you may see a different card selection sometimes

Q: Can I play multiple accounts?
A: Technically yes, but don't be greedy.

Q: I got the error ""cannot read property split of undefined""
A: check that the credentials file doesn't contain any but "".env"" in the name. (no .txt or anything else) and check that there is nothing but ACCOUNT=yourusername and PASSWORD=yourpass in 2 lines with no spaces. Also you must use the username with the posting key, and not the email address.

Q: Why the bot doesn't use my best card I paid 1000$?
A: Because the bot select cards based on the statistics of the previous battles choosing the most winning team for your cards. it's a bot, not a thinking human being!

Q: Why the bot doesn't use the Furious Chicken?
A: same as above

# Overview
Telebot is a bot framework for [Telegram Bot API](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api).
This package provides the best of its kind API for command routing, inline query requests and keyboards, as well
as callbacks. Actually, I went a couple steps further, so instead of making a 1:1 API wrapper I chose to focus on
the beauty of API and performance. Some strong sides of Telebot are:

* Real concise API
* Command routing
* Middleware
* Transparent File API
* Effortless bot callbacks

All the methods of Telebot API are _extremely_ easy to memorize and get used to. Also, consider Telebot a
highload-ready solution. I'll test and benchmark the most popular actions and if necessary, optimize
against them without sacrificing API quality.

# Getting Started
Let's take a look at the minimal Telebot setup:

```go
package main

import (
	""log""
	""os""
	""time""

	tele ""gopkg.in/telebot.v3""
)

func main() {
	pref := tele.Settings{
		Token:  os.Getenv(""TOKEN""),
		Poller: &tele.LongPoller{Timeout: 10 * time.Second},
	}

	b, err := tele.NewBot(pref)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
		return
	}

	b.Handle(""/hello"", func(c tele.Context) error {
		return c.Send(""Hello!"")
	})

	b.Start()
}

```

Simple, innit? Telebot's routing system takes care of delivering updates
to their endpoints, so in order to get to handle any meaningful event,
all you got to do is just plug your function into one of the Telebot-provided
endpoints. You can find the full list
[here](https://godoc.org/gopkg.in/telebot.v3#pkg-constants).

There are dozens of supported endpoints (see package consts). Let me know
if you'd like to see some endpoint or endpoint ideas implemented. This system
is completely extensible, so I can introduce them without breaking
backwards compatibility.

## Context
Context is a special type that wraps a huge update structure and represents
the context of the current event. It provides several helpers, which allow
getting, for example, the chat that this update had been sent in, no matter
what kind of update this is.

```go
b.Handle(tele.OnText, func(c tele.Context) error {
	// All the text messages that weren't
	// captured by existing handlers.

	var (
		user = c.Sender()
		text = c.Text()
	)

	// Use full-fledged bot's functions
	// only if you need a result:
	msg, err := b.Send(user, text)
	if err != nil {
		return err
	}

	// Instead, prefer a context short-hand:
	return c.Send(text)
})

b.Handle(tele.OnChannelPost, func(c tele.Context) error {
	// Channel posts only.
	msg := c.Message()
})

b.Handle(tele.OnPhoto, func(c tele.Context) error {
	// Photos only.
	photo := c.Message().Photo
})

b.Handle(tele.OnQuery, func(c tele.Context) error {
	// Incoming inline queries.
	return c.Answer(...)
})
```

## Middleware
Telebot has a simple and recognizable way to set up middleware — chained functions with access to `Context`, called before the handler execution.

Import a `middleware` package to get some basic out-of-box middleware
implementations:
```go
import ""gopkg.in/telebot.v3/middleware""
```

```go
// Global-scoped middleware:
b.Use(middleware.Logger())
b.Use(middleware.AutoRespond())

// Group-scoped middleware:
adminOnly := b.Group()
adminOnly.Use(middleware.Whitelist(adminIDs...))
adminOnly.Handle(""/ban"", onBan)
adminOnly.Handle(""/kick"", onKick)

// Handler-scoped middleware:
b.Handle(tele.OnText, onText, middleware.IgnoreVia())
```

Custom middleware example:
```go
// AutoResponder automatically responds to every callback update.
func AutoResponder(next tele.HandlerFunc) tele.HandlerFunc {
	return func(c tele.Context) error {
		if c.Callback() != nil {
			defer c.Respond()
		}
		return next(c) // continue execution chain
	}
}
```

## Poller
Telebot doesn't really care how you provide it with incoming updates, as long
as you set it up with a Poller, or call ProcessUpdate for each update:

```go
// Poller is a provider of Updates.
//
// All pollers must implement Poll(), which accepts bot
// pointer and subscription channel and start polling
// synchronously straight away.
type Poller interface {
	// Poll is supposed to take the bot object
	// subscription channel and start polling
	// for Updates immediately.
	//
	// Poller must listen for stop constantly and close
	// it as soon as it's done polling.
	Poll(b *Bot, updates chan Update, stop chan struct{})
}
```

## Commands
When handling commands, Telebot supports both direct (`/command`) and group-like
syntax (`/command@botname`) and will never deliver messages addressed to some
other bot, even if [privacy mode](https://core.telegram.org/bots#privacy-mode) is off.

For simplified deep-linking, Telebot also extracts payload:
```go
// Command: /start <PAYLOAD>
b.Handle(""/start"", func(c tele.Context) error {
	fmt.Println(c.Message().Payload) // <PAYLOAD>
})
```

For multiple arguments use:
```go
// Command: /tags <tag1> <tag2> <...>
b.Handle(""/tags"", func(c tele.Context) error {
	tags := c.Args() // list of arguments splitted by a space
	for _, tag := range tags {
		// iterate through passed arguments
	}
})
```

## Files
>Telegram allows files up to 50 MB in size.

Telebot allows to both upload (from disk or by URL) and download (from Telegram)
files in bot's scope. Also, sending any kind of media with a File created
from disk will upload the file to Telegram automatically:
```go
a := &tele.Audio{File: tele.FromDisk(""file.ogg"")}

fmt.Println(a.OnDisk()) // true
fmt.Println(a.InCloud()) // false

// Will upload the file from disk and send it to the recipient
b.Send(recipient, a)

// Next time you'll be sending this very *Audio, Telebot won't
// re-upload the same file but rather utilize its Telegram FileID
b.Send(otherRecipient, a)

fmt.Println(a.OnDisk()) // true
fmt.Println(a.InCloud()) // true
fmt.Println(a.FileID) // <Telegram file ID>
```

You might want to save certain `File`s in order to avoid re-uploading. Feel free
to marshal them into whatever format, `File` only contain public fields, so no
data will ever be lost.

## Sendable
Send is undoubtedly the most important method in Telebot. `Send()` accepts a
`Recipient` (could be user, group or a channel) and a `Sendable`. Other types other than
the Telebot-provided media types (`Photo`, `Audio`, `Video`, etc.) are `Sendable`.
If you create composite types of your own, and they satisfy the `Sendable` interface,
Telebot will be able to send them out.

```go
// Sendable is any object that can send itself.
//
// This is pretty cool, since it lets bots implement
// custom Sendables for complex kinds of media or
// chat objects spanning across multiple messages.
type Sendable interface {
	Send(*Bot, Recipient, *SendOptions) (*Message, error)
}
```

The only type at the time that doesn't fit `Send()` is `Album` and there is a reason
for that. Albums were added not so long ago, so they are slightly quirky for backwards
compatibilities sake. In fact, an `Album` can be sent, but never received. Instead,
Telegram returns a `[]Message`, one for each media object in the album:
```go
p := &tele.Photo{File: tele.FromDisk(""chicken.jpg"")}
v := &tele.Video{File: tele.FromURL(""http://video.mp4"")}

msgs, err := b.SendAlbum(user, tele.Album{p, v})
```

### Send options
Send options are objects and flags you can pass to `Send()`, `Edit()` and friends
as optional arguments (following the recipient and the text/media). The most
important one is called `SendOptions`, it lets you control _all_ the properties of
the message supported by Telegram. The only drawback is that it's rather
inconvenient to use at times, so `Send()` supports multiple shorthands:
```go
// regular send options
b.Send(user, ""text"", &tele.SendOptions{
	// ...
})

// ReplyMarkup is a part of SendOptions,
// but often it's the only option you need
b.Send(user, ""text"", &tele.ReplyMarkup{
	// ...
})

// flags: no notification && no web link preview
b.Send(user, ""text"", tele.Silent, tele.NoPreview)
```

Full list of supported option-flags you can find
[here](https://pkg.go.dev/gopkg.in/telebot.v3#Option).

## Editable
If you want to edit some existing message, you don't really need to store the
original `*Message` object. In fact, upon edit, Telegram only requires `chat_id`
and `message_id`. So you don't really need the Message as a whole. Also, you
might want to store references to certain messages in the database, so I thought
it made sense for *any* Go struct to be editable as a Telegram message, to implement
`Editable`:
```go
// Editable is an interface for all objects that
// provide ""message signature"", a pair of 32-bit
// message ID and 64-bit chat ID, both required
// for edit operations.
//
// Use case: DB model struct for messages to-be
// edited with, say two columns: msg_id,chat_id
// could easily implement MessageSig() making
// instances of stored messages editable.
type Editable interface {
	// MessageSig is a ""message signature"".
	//
	// For inline messages, return chatID = 0.
	MessageSig() (messageID int, chatID int64)
}
```

For example, `Message` type is Editable. Here is the implementation of `StoredMessage`
type, provided by Telebot:
```go
// StoredMessage is an example struct suitable for being
// stored in the database as-is or being embedded into
// a larger struct, which is often the case (you might
// want to store some metadata alongside, or might not.)
type StoredMessage struct {
	MessageID int   `sql:""message_id"" json:""message_id""`
	ChatID    int64 `sql:""chat_id"" json:""chat_id""`
}

func (x StoredMessage) MessageSig() (int, int64) {
	return x.MessageID, x.ChatID
}
```

Why bother at all? Well, it allows you to do things like this:
```go
// just two integer columns in the database
var msgs []tele.StoredMessage
db.Find(&msgs) // gorm syntax

for _, msg := range msgs {
	bot.Edit(&msg, ""Updated text"")
	// or
	bot.Delete(&msg)
}
```

I find it incredibly neat. Worth noting, at this point of time there exists
another method in the Edit family, `EditCaption()` which is of a pretty
rare use, so I didn't bother including it to `Edit()`, just like I did with
`SendAlbum()` as it would inevitably lead to unnecessary complications.
```go
var m *Message

// change caption of a photo, audio, etc.
bot.EditCaption(m, ""new caption"")
```

## Keyboards
Telebot supports both kinds of keyboards Telegram provides: reply and inline
keyboards. Any button can also act as endpoints for `Handle()`.

```go
var (
	// Universal markup builders.
	menu     = &tele.ReplyMarkup{ResizeKeyboard: true}
	selector = &tele.ReplyMarkup{}

	// Reply buttons.
	btnHelp     = menu.Text(""ℹ Help"")
	btnSettings = menu.Text(""⚙ Settings"")

	// Inline buttons.
	//
	// Pressing it will cause the client to
	// send the bot a callback.
	//
	// Make sure Unique stays unique as per button kind
	// since it's required for callback routing to work.
	//
	btnPrev = selector.Data(""⬅"", ""prev"", ...)
	btnNext = selector.Data(""➡"", ""next"", ...)
)

menu.Reply(
	menu.Row(btnHelp),
	menu.Row(btnSettings),
)
selector.Inline(
	selector.Row(btnPrev, btnNext),
)

b.Handle(""/start"", func(c tele.Context) error {
	return c.Send(""Hello!"", menu)
})

// On reply button pressed (message)
b.Handle(&btnHelp, func(c tele.Context) error {
	return c.Edit(""Here is some help: ..."")
})

// On inline button pressed (callback)
b.Handle(&btnPrev, func(c tele.Context) error {
	return c.Respond()
})
```

You can use markup constructor for every type of possible button:
```go
r := b.NewMarkup()

// Reply buttons:
r.Text(""Hello!"")
r.Contact(""Send phone number"")
r.Location(""Send location"")
r.Poll(tele.PollQuiz)

// Inline buttons:
r.Data(""Show help"", ""help"") // data is optional
r.Data(""Delete item"", ""delete"", item.ID)
r.URL(""Visit"", ""https://google.com"")
r.Query(""Search"", query)
r.QueryChat(""Share"", query)
r.Login(""Login"", &tele.Login{...})
```

## Inline mode
So if you want to handle incoming inline queries you better plug the `tele.OnQuery`
endpoint and then use the `Answer()` method to send a list of inline queries
back. I think at the time of writing, Telebot supports all of the provided result
types (but not the cached ones). This is what it looks like:

```go
b.Handle(tele.OnQuery, func(c tele.Context) error {
	urls := []string{
		""http://photo.jpg"",
		""http://photo2.jpg"",
	}

	results := make(tele.Results, len(urls)) // []tele.Result
	for i, url := range urls {
		result := &tele.PhotoResult{
			URL:      url,
			ThumbURL: url, // required for photos
		}

		results[i] = result
		// needed to set a unique string ID for each result
		results[i].SetResultID(strconv.Itoa(i))
	}

	return c.Answer(&tele.QueryResponse{
		Results:   results,
		CacheTime: 60, // a minute
	})
})
```

There's not much to talk about really. It also supports some form of authentication
through deep-linking. For that, use fields `SwitchPMText` and `SwitchPMParameter`
of `QueryResponse`.

460,460,grapeot/WechatForwardBot,Python,"# 微信群机器人

目前支持的功能：

* 响应/help，显示帮助信息。
* 在两个群中间转发文本，图片，自定义动画表情，链接。微信群有500人的容量限制，一个消息转发机器人可以通过把几个群接起来相互转发消息来突破这样的限制。
* 用正则表达式来自定义回复。
* 响应/tagcloud，生成整个群的标签云，或者响应/mytag，生成某个用户的标签云。
* 响应/activity，生成群的活跃度时间图，以及活跃用户饼图。
* 自动排队。如果群里出现了二传，自动三传。
* 斗图。/doutu进入斗图模式，用深度学习确定回复什么图，进行斗图。
* 兼容Windows和Linux。如果在Windows下运行，请更改字体路径。

目前不支持的功能：

* 转发表情商城中的表情（即使表情是免费的）
* 转发红包（想啥呢你）
* 多于两个群的转发（但更改应该很简单）

## 部署

* 运行`deploy.sh`。或者手工安装python，mongodb，然后安装`requirements.txt`中的库。
* 依赖于[itchat](https://itchat.readthedocs.io/zh/latest/), [mongodb](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/install-community/).

## 运行

* 这个小工具不是针对最终用户的，所以现在需要改code（`main.py`）来设置一些参数，尤其是群名，黑白名单等等。
* `python3 -u main.py`。会弹出一个二维码扫码登录。
* 如果在Linux VPS上运行，ssh进去的时候记得加上X转发，这样才能看到二维码。如果不用X转发的话也可以手工下载文件或者改用命令行二维码。

## 已知问题

* 如果启动时候说无法找到群，请在群里说句话。这是微信接口的限制所致。
* 如果启动的时候说连接27017端口connection refused，这是因为你没有安装mongodb。安装mongodb可以解决这个问题。
* 如果出来的标签云里面都是框框，这是字体没有配置好所致。请去`main.py`里面更改字体路径。
* 斗图的功能需要一些深度学习的基础知识和Caffe的相关经验。目前不提供支持。但DoutuRobot文件夹下面有一些文档可以参考。

461,461,googleworkspace/hangouts-chat-samples,Python,"# Google Chat code samples

This repository contains the code samples for
[Google Chat bots](https://developers.google.com/hangouts/chat/).
There are folders of samples dependent on language and platform. Generally
the Java and Python samples live in each respective directory, but JavaScript
has multiple form factors (client-side, server-side/Node.js, Google Apps
Script [also server side], and Cloud Functions [GCP or Firebase]).

Which JS platform you choose depends on the type of bot application you're
using/writing. Apps Script features tighter integration with Google Workspace data and
applications, while Google Cloud Functions has a tighter integration with Google
Cloud Platform services and APIs. Finally, mobile apps or mobile web apps are
more likely to want to take advantage of Cloud Functions for Firebase. It is
also generally straightforward to port from one JS implementation to another,
for example, to Node.js.

In each folder, you can find a language-specific implementation of the
one or more of the following code samples:

  - **Basic bot**: This bot receives event notices and messages from Google
    Chat and responds synchronously with simple text responses. This sample
    demonstrates how to create an HTTP endpoint bot using
    [Google App Engine](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/).
  - **Basic async bot**: This bot receives event notices and messages from
    Google Chat and responds asynchronously with simple text responses. The
    responses will appear in the same thread that raised the original event or
    message. This sample is an HTTP endpoint bot built upon
    [Google App Engine](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/).
  - **Pub/Sub bot**: This bot uses
    [Google Cloud Pub/Sub](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/) to receive messages
    from Google Chat. The bot responds back to Google Chat asynchronously.
  - **Card bot**: This bot receives event notices and messages from Google
    Chat and responds synchronously with a
    [card-formatted](https://developers.google.com/hangouts/chat/concepts/cards)
    response. This sample is an HTTP endpoint bot built upon
    [Google App Engine](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/).
  - **Vote bot**: This bot demonstrates updating interactive cards by providing
    a platform whereby users can vote on topics, such as who can do lunch today,
    who wants to play ball at lunch, etc. Samples can feature images or be
    text-only.

For additional details about how to set up and run each sample, consult the
README file included with the sample.

**Note**: The Google Chat application, and the developer platform, are only
available to Google Workspace accounts. You will not be able to develop or test a bot
with an @gmail.com account.

This is the main repo for Werewolf for Telegram.

For language file updates, please submit the xml file on Telegram to the [support chat](http://telegram.me/werewolfsupport) and ask for assistance

### Visual Studio Team Services Continuous Integration		
![build status](https://parabola949.visualstudio.com/_apis/public/build/definitions/c0505bb4-b972-452b-88be-acdc00501797/2/badge)

## Requirements
* .NET Framework 4.5.2
* SQL Server (I am using 2014) / SQL Server 2016
* Windows Server

## Setup

To set up werewolf on a private server, follow these steps:

1. Go to [BotFather](https://telegram.me/BotFather) and create a new bot.  Answer all of the questions it asks, and you will receive an API Token.
   * On your server, open regedit, and go to `HKLM\SOFTWARE\`, create a new Key named `Werewolf` (HKLM - HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE)
   * In the new key create a new string value named `ProductionAPI`.  
   * Paste your API token here.
2. Grab the werewolf.sql file from this repository
   * Open the file in notepad, notepad++, whatever you use
   * Double check the path at the top of the file - update it if you are using a different SQL version
   * Run the sql script.  This will create the `werewolf` database and all the tables / views / stored procs to go with it
   * If you already have some admins (including yourself), add their TelegramID's to the `dbo.Admin` table
		* In order to obtain your ID, headover to your bot in telegram and /Start. After that, toss a random text to it. Enter this URL to your browser (https://api.telegram.org/botYOURTELEGRAMBOTAPIKEY/getUpdates)
3. Now it's time to compile the source code
   * On your server, open regedit
   * In the `Werewolf` key create a new string value named `BotConnectionString`.
   * Paste the Connection String here.
        * Connection String should be this (change the values) `metadata=res://*/WerewolfModel.csdl|res://*/WerewolfModel.ssdl|res://*/WerewolfModel.msl;provider=System.Data.SqlClient;provider connection string=""data source=SERVERADDRESS;initial catalog=werewolf;user id=USERNAME;password=PASSWORD;MultipleActiveResultSets=True;App=EntityFramework""`
			* If you are using Windows Authentication for your MSSQL Server, do take note that the password property will NO Longer be required. You're required to replace it(both user id and password) with ""Trusted_Connection=True;"" instead.
      * .gitignore has marked this file, so it won't be committed. **However, when you create the setting, VS will copy it to the app.config - make sure to remove it if you plan on committing back to your fork**
   * Create another new string value named BotanReleaseAPI. You can leave this blank if you don't want to track your usage using BotanIO.
   * If you plan on running another instance of the bot as beta, add another two new string values named BotanBetaAPI and BetaAPI. Again, you can leave BotanBetaAPI empty if you want. Set BetaAPI to the token of your beta bot.
   * In Visual Studio, open the solution.  Make sure you are set to `RELEASE` build.  You may want to go into `Werewolf_Control.Helpers.UpdateHelper.cs` and add your id to `internal static int[] Devs = { ... }`.  Also, double check the `Settings.cs` files in both `Werewolf Control/Helpers` and `Werewolf Node/Helpers`.
   * Build the solution
4. Server directories
   * Pick any directory for your root directory

   | Directory | Contents |
   |-----------|---------:|
   |`root\Instance Name\Control`|Control build|
   |`root\Instance Name\Node 1`|Node build|
   |`root\Instance Name\Node <#>`|Node updates can be added to a new Node folder.  Running `/replacenodes` in Telegram will tell the bot to automatically find the newest node (by build time) and run it|
   |`root\Instance Name\Logs`|Logging directory|
   |`root\Languages`|Language xml files - These files are shared by all instances of Werewolf|

   * Note - Once all nodes are running the newest version (Node 2 directory), the next time you update nodes, you can put the new files in Node 1 and `/replacenodes`.  Again, the bot will always take whichever node it finds that is the newest, as long as the directory has `Node` in the name.  **do not name any other directory in the root folder anything with `Node` in it**
5. Fire up the bot!
6. If you try to start a game now, you will notice that the bot will just respond with an error. That is because you didn't update the gif ids yet. See the section below for instructions on how to do this.


## GIF SUPPORT
In order to use GIFs with the bot, you will need to ""teach"" the bot the new GIF IDs.  From Telegram, run `/learngif`, the bot will respond with `GIF learning = true`.  Now send it a GIF, and the bot will reply with an ID.  Send the bot all the GIFs you need.  In the Node project, go to Helpers > Settings.cs and find the GIF lists.  You'll need to remove all of the existing IDs and put in the IDs you just got from the bot.

You can test these by running `/dumpgifs` (preferrably in Private Message!).  Make sure you check out DevCommands.cs, and look at the `DumpGifs()` method - most of it is commented out.  Uncomment what you need.

464,464,mdgspace/bot,CoffeeScript,"# Hubot

This is a version of GitHub's Campfire bot, hubot. He's pretty cool.

This version is designed to be deployed on [Heroku][heroku]. This README was generated for you by hubot to help get you started. Definitely update and improve to talk about your own instance, how to use and deploy, what functionality he has, etc!

[heroku]: http://www.heroku.com

### Testing Hubot Locally

You can test your hubot by running the following.

    % bin/hubot

You'll see some start up output about where your scripts come from and a
prompt.

    [Sun, 04 Dec 2011 18:41:11 GMT] INFO Loading adapter shell
    [Sun, 04 Dec 2011 18:41:11 GMT] INFO Loading scripts from /home/tomb/Development/hubot/scripts
    [Sun, 04 Dec 2011 18:41:11 GMT] INFO Loading scripts from /home/tomb/Development/hubot/src/scripts
    Hubot>

Then you can interact with hubot by typing `hubot help`.

    Hubot> hubot help

    Hubot> animate me <query> - The same thing as `image me`, except adds a few
    convert me <expression> to <units> - Convert expression to given units.
    help - Displays all of the help commands that Hubot knows about.
    ...


### Scripting

Take a look at the scripts in the `./scripts` folder for examples.
Delete any scripts you think are useless or boring.  Add whatever functionality you
want hubot to have. Read up on what you can do with hubot in the [Scripting Guide](https://github.com/github/hubot/blob/master/docs/scripting.md).

### Redis Persistence

If you are going to use the `redis-brain.coffee` script from `hubot-scripts`
(strongly suggested), you will need to add the Redis to Go addon on Heroku which requires a verified
account or you can create an account at [Redis to Go][redistogo] and manually
set the `REDISTOGO_URL` variable.

    % heroku config:set REDISTOGO_URL=""...""

If you don't require any persistence feel free to remove the
`redis-brain.coffee` from `hubot-scripts.json` and you don't need to worry
about redis at all.

[redistogo]: https://redistogo.com/

## Adapters

Adapters are the interface to the service you want your hubot to run on. This
can be something like Campfire or IRC. There are a number of third party
adapters that the community have contributed. Check
[Hubot Adapters][hubot-adapters] for the available ones.

If you would like to run a non-Campfire or shell adapter you will need to add
the adapter package as a dependency to the `package.json` file in the
`dependencies` section.

Once you've added the dependency and run `npm install` to install it you can
then run hubot with the adapter.

    % bin/hubot -a <adapter>

Where `<adapter>` is the name of your adapter without the `hubot-` prefix.

[hubot-adapters]: https://github.com/github/hubot/blob/master/docs/adapters.md

## hubot-scripts

There will inevitably be functionality that everyone will want. Instead
of adding it to hubot itself, you can submit pull requests to
[hubot-scripts][hubot-scripts].

To enable scripts from the hubot-scripts package, add the script name with
extension as a double quoted string to the `hubot-scripts.json` file in this
repo.

[hubot-scripts]: https://github.com/github/hubot-scripts

## external-scripts

Tired of waiting for your script to be merged into `hubot-scripts`? Want to
maintain the repository and package yourself? Then this added functionality
maybe for you!

Hubot is now able to load scripts from third-party `npm` packages! To enable
this functionality you can follow the following steps.

1. Add the packages as dependencies into your `package.json`
2. `npm install` to make sure those packages are installed

To enable third-party scripts that you've added you will need to add the package
name as a double quoted string to the `external-scripts.json` file in this repo.

## Deployment

    % heroku create --stack cedar
    % git push heroku master
    % heroku ps:scale app=1

If your Heroku account has been verified you can run the following to enable
and add the Redis to Go addon to your app.

    % heroku addons:add redistogo:nano

If you run into any problems, checkout Heroku's [docs][heroku-node-docs].

You'll need to edit the `Procfile` to set the name of your hubot.

More detailed documentation can be found on the
[deploying hubot onto Heroku][deploy-heroku] wiki page.

### Deploying to UNIX or Windows

If you would like to deploy to either a UNIX operating system or Windows.
Please check out the [deploying hubot onto UNIX][deploy-unix] and
[deploying hubot onto Windows][deploy-windows] wiki pages.

[heroku-node-docs]: http://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/node-js
[deploy-heroku]: https://github.com/github/hubot/blob/master/docs/deploying/heroku.md
[deploy-unix]: https://github.com/github/hubot/blob/master/docs/deploying/unix.md
[deploy-windows]: https://github.com/github/hubot/blob/master/docs/deploying/unix.md

## Campfire Variables

If you are using the Campfire adapter you will need to set some environment
variables. Refer to the documentation for other adapters and the configuraiton
of those, links to the adapters can be found on [Hubot Adapters][hubot-adapters].

Create a separate Campfire user for your bot and get their token from the web
UI.

    % heroku config:set HUBOT_CAMPFIRE_TOKEN=""...""

Get the numeric IDs of the rooms you want the bot to join, comma delimited. If
you want the bot to connect to `https://mysubdomain.campfirenow.com/room/42` 
and `https://mysubdomain.campfirenow.com/room/1024` then you'd add it like this:

    % heroku config:set HUBOT_CAMPFIRE_ROOMS=""42,1024""

Add the subdomain hubot should connect to. If you web URL looks like
`http://mysubdomain.campfirenow.com` then you'd add it like this:

    % heroku config:set HUBOT_CAMPFIRE_ACCOUNT=""mysubdomain""

[hubot-adapters]: https://github.com/github/hubot/blob/master/docs/adapters.md

## Restart the bot

You may want to get comfortable with `heroku logs` and `heroku restart`
if you're having issues.

---

## Installation using Docker
- Build the image using `docker build . -t bot:latest`
- Add the environment variables in a .env file
- Create a container to run the image `docker run -d --env-file .env --name bot_cont -p 127.0.0.1:<Port on host>:8080 bot`

## Development setup using Docker
You can use the `dev_docker-compose.yml` file to spin up containers with Redis services easily.
Use this env variables for the same.
```
REDIS_URL=redis://redis:6379
```
Run this command to run the containers
```shell
$ docker-compose -f dev_docker-compose.yml up
```
To interact with hubot using shell,
```shell
$ docker exec -it mdg-bot bash
$ ./bin/hubot
```

466,466,samc621/SneakerBot,JavaScript,"# SneakerBot

This bot uses Node.js and Puppeteer to automate the checkout on various sneaker websites. It currently works on:

1. Footsites (footlocker.com, footaction.com, eastbay.com, champssports.com)
2. Shopify sites (e.g. BdgaStore, Concepts, Kith, etc.)
3. Demandware sites (e.g. Adidas)
4. Nike.com
5. Supreme

## About this project

This bot was made by developers, for developers. It is not a commercial product, it is a free and open source software. Thus, it may not be suitable for those with little or no software engineering experience.

The developers of this software should not be held liable for any lost opportunities resulting from its usage.

## Prerequisites

Install the following on your machine:

1. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (comes with npm)
2. [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)

## Set up PostgreSQL

View the [documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.0/sql-createdatabase.html) for creating a user and database.

## Configure environment variables

Make a copy of the `.env.example` file, replacing `example` with the name of your `NODE_ENV` e.g. `.env.local` or `.env.development`.

When you're ready, declare the environment name with:

### Linux/Mac

`$ export NODE_ENV=local`

### Windows

`$ set NODE_ENV=local`

### How to populate the .env file

1. `PORT` is the port that the Node/Express API server will run on, _defaults to 8080_. You can use any TCP/UDP port (0-65535) that is unused by another service e.g. Postgres on 5432.
2. `DB_USERNAME` and `DB_PASSWORD` is the username/password combo for the Postgres user you created (see documentation above for assistance).
3. `DB_NAME` is the name of the Postgres database you created.
4. `DB_PORT` and `DB_HOST` are the Postgres defaults, `5432` and `localhost`, respectively.
5. `EMAIL_HOST` and `EMAIL_PORT` are the SMTP details for your email provider e.g. `smtp.gmail.com` and `587`, respectively, for Gmail.
6. `EMAIL_USERNAME` and `EMAIL_PASSWORD` are your actual email credentials. We use the SMTP server to send email notifications about things like checkout errors or completions.
7. `CARD_NUMBER`, `NAME_ON_CARD`, `EXPIRATION_MONTH`, `EXPIRATION_YEAR`, and `SECURITY_CODE` are your actual credit/debit card details.
8. `API_KEY_2CAPTCHA` is your API key provided by `2Captcha` if you so desire to use their service. This can be left blank if not.

## Optional: Configure credit cards

The `.env` file that you configure is set up for a single credit card.

However, if you want to specify multiple credit cards, populate `credit-cards.json` using the example from `credit-cards-example.json`.

If you prefer not to use this method, you can simply leave this JSON file as-is.

When starting a task, you can optionally specify the card you want to use via its `friendlyName`, otherwise the card from the `.env` file will be used.

## Install the dependencies

`$ npm install`

## Run the DB migrations

> You may need to include `npx` at the start of the commands

`$ knex migrate:latest`

## Run the DB seeders

`$ knex seed:run`

## Start the server

Tasks run parallelly using [puppeteer-cluster](https://github.com/thomasdondorf/puppeteer-cluster).

Before starting up the server, define the number of concurrent tasks you plan to run:

`$ export PARALLEL_TASKS=5`

If you do not define this variable, it will default to `1`.

You can of course run more tasks, but they will be queued to run in a first-in, first-out (FIFO) manner.

Keep in mind that tasks that do not result in `checkoutComplete` will remain idle (not terminate) so that you can open the browser and view the error(s).

If a task encounters a captcha that must be manually solved, it will also remain idle and await completion.

Each task uses its own browser, so it's also important to keep in mind the CPU constraints of your machine.

When you're ready, start the server with:

`$ npm start`

## Optional: Using Docker / Docker Compose

This may be particularly useful for Linux users who have reported issues with Puppeteer and Chromium.

You will need to have [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) and/or [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed to use this.

You will also need to make a copy of the `.env.example` file, replacing `example` with the name of your `NODE_ENV` e.g. `docker`.

A Docker image is available for the server code [here](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/samc621/sneakerbot). You can also build it yourself by running the following in the root directory:

`$ docker build -t sneakerbot .`

Then run it and specify the env file with:

`docker run -p 5900:5900 -p 8000:8000 --env NODE_ENV=docker --env-file .env.docker sneakerbot` (replace `8000` with whatever `PORT` you specified in `.env.docker`)

This Docker image is built from `node:12` and uses [xvfb](https://www.x.org/releases/X11R7.6/doc/man/man1/Xvfb.1.xhtml) with [x11vnc](https://github.com/LibVNC/x11vnc) to provide access to a GUI.

You can use [vncviewer](https://www.realvnc.com/en/connect/download/viewer/) to connect to the VNC server running in the container.

You may also opt to run Postgres via Docker, in which case you can make use of the `docker-compose.yml` file. Simply run the following in the root directory:

`$ docker-compose build`

`$ docker-compose up`

## API

This bot exposes a Node/Express API server for managing addresses, proxies, and tasks. I would eventually like to see a UI, which integrates these APIs, built.

For each API, view the docs and try the requests in Postman.

- [Addresses](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/5027621/TVt2c3ef) - this is how you can pre-store billing and shipping addresses applied to tasks, and more specifically used at checkout time.
- [Proxies](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/5027621/TVt2c3ee) - this is how you can pre-store proxies that the bot will use when launching a task. Proxies are rotated so that they are never reused. In the future, this bot may include an integration with a proxy service like [Bright Data (formerly Luminati)](https://brightdata.com/).
- [Tasks](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/5027621/TVt2c3ed) - this is how you can pre-store, and then start checkout tasks.

### UPDATE (as of 05/30/2021)

You can now specify a `product_code` on tasks. You will still need to provide the `url` e.g. https://nike.com but can also provide a `product_code` e.g. ""DA3130-100"".

If a `product_code` is specified, the bot will iteratively search the desired site until there is a search result, click it, and then proceed as usual.

This will work with the `nike.com`, `footsites`, and `demandware` sites.

If using with adidas.com, be sure to include the full site path e.g. https://www.adidas.com/us.

Feel free to check the new [example](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/5027621/TVt2c3ed#d55d7ad1-7126-4663-9fa1-fdc2220615d4) ""with product code"" under the POST /tasks API.

### UPDATE (as of 06/24/2021)

You can now specify a `WEBHOOK_ENDPOINT` in your `.env` file for receiving webhook events (over HTTP/HTTPS) about task status.

When a task is done processing, a `POST` request will be sent to the supplied URL with the following data:

```
{
    taskId: integer,
    checkoutComplete: true/false,
    message: Some text about the task status, the same message is sent via email
}
```

## Starting a Task

You may start a task via `POST /v1/tasks/:id/start` or use the `start-task.js` script like:

`$ TASK_ID=<TASK_ID> CARD_FRIENDLY_NAME=<CARD_FRIENDLY_NAME> node ./scripts/start-task.js`

## Stopping a Task

You may stop a task that has run too long via `POST /v1/tasks/:id/stop`

## Captcha Solving

This bot enables manual and automatic (via [2Captcha](https://2captcha.com)) solving of captchas.

When creating a task, you can specify `auto_solve_captcha` (Boolean), however, this parameter is optional and defaults to `true`.

You must sign up for and fund a 2Captcha account, and then add your `API_KEY_2CAPTCHA` to the .env file in order to auto-solve captchas.

For manually-solving captchas, you will be given a 5-minute timeout after the email notification to check the browser and solve the captcha.

## Motivation

As a teenager, I operated sneakerbots.us, where I sold sneakerbots like this in addition to early links and ATC services.

Fastforward several years, I decided to upgrade this all-in-one bot from Java + Selenium to Node.js + Puppeteer, which I enjoy more for bot projects.

I am open sourcing this repo now, since I no longer operate the business, but also because I am of the opinion that this software can rival many of its commercial competitors.

Feel free to open a Pull Request to contribute to this proejct and help make it better! I will continue to support more websites and add more features as I can.

Also feel free to open an Issue or contact me via Telegram @samc621 if you have any trouble.

Boto 3 Sample Application
=========================
This application implements a drop video transcoder that lets
you easily convert media files by dragging and dropping them
on your computer. It makes use of the following services:

* AWS IAM
* Amazon S3
* Amazon SNS
* Amazon SQS
* Amazon Elastic Transcoder

The general flow of the program can be described as:

1. Ensure AWS setup / permissions
2. Watch a directory for new files
3. Upload new files to S3
4. Create a transcoder job for each input file
5. Poll for job completed SQS messages
6. Download transcoded files
7. Repeat steps 2-7 until user quits (``ctrl+c``)

Running the Sample Application
------------------------------
First, ensure that you have `Boto 3 <https://github.com/boto/boto3>`_
installed::

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Then you can run the transcoder. The first time it is run, it will
create a default configuration file for you in ``~/.autotranscode.json``::

    python transcoder.py

Edit the file to suit your local setup and then run the same
command again. Once the application is running, you can drag
and drop files into your source folder to have them transcoded
and downloaded to the destination folder.

### Results signal prediction

I will cut the dataset to train and test datasets,

1. Train dataset derived from starting timestamp until last 30 days
2. Test dataset derived from last 30 days until end of the dataset

So we will let the model do forecasting based on last 30 days, and we will going to repeat the experiment for 10 times. You can increase it locally if you want, and tuning parameters will help you by a lot.

## What is a webchat?

The SAP Conversational AI webchat let you **deploy a bot straight to a website**. It will be embed and available through a chat box on your pages.
The webchat is one of the many channels available on [SAP Conversational AI](https://cai.tools.sap), and end-to-end bot building platform.
This webchat is built using the [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) library, along with [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux) for state managment.

<div align=""center"">
  <img src=""assets/webchat-github.png"" />
</div>

## Compatibility

This webchat is supported by all mobile and desktop browsers in their latest versions.
Internet Explorer support starts at version 9.0.

## Usage

Three different installations on the webchat module are possible.
- The default is the simplest and fatest route, and offers some customization options.
- The self-hosted webchat offers even more customization option, but you'll have to deal with the hosting and maintenance of the module.
- Use it as a React component

### Default webchat

To use the webchat, you need an account on [SAP Conversational AI](https://cai.tools.sap) and a bot.
Then, go to the **CONNECT** tab and click on **Webchat**. It will open a window that lets you adjust your webchat settings, including:
* color scheme,
* header customization,
* bot and user pictures,
* webchat logo and call to action,
* conversation duration

Once you're satisfied with the settings, click on the **SAVE** button. A script tag appears, and you just have to copy paste it in your web page to embed the webchat. The script must be placed in the `<body>` tag.

<div align=""center"">
  <img src=""assets/webchat-600.gif"" />
</div>


### Self-hosted webchat

If you want to customize your webchat even more, you can opt for a self-hosted installatiton. Just fork this project to get started!

#### Installation

Clone the repository you forked, and install the dependencies.

```
$> git clone YOUR_REPO_URL
$> cd webchat
$> npm install
```

#### Run in development mode

```
$> npm run start
```

#### Eslint + prettier

```
$> npm run prettier
```

#### Build for production

```
$> npm run build
```

#### Use your webchat

Once you're done, build it and host it.
To use it instead of the default one provided by SAP Conversational AI, you need to set up the Webchat channel in the **CONNECT** tab of your bot.
You'll be using the same script as the default installation, but you have **to replace the src field by your own URL**.


```
<script
  src=""YOUR_WEBCHAT_URL""
  ...
></script>
```

### React component
You can import the webchat as a React component like the following example:
``` js
import CaiWebchat from 'webchat';

export default class ReactWebchat extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <CaiWebchat
        onRef={ref => {
          this.webchat = ref;
        }}

```
|Name|Description|
|---|---|
|clearMessages()|Clear all messages in the webchat|

### Bot Memory management
One thing you might want to do is to send custom data from your website to the bot, like the name of the logged in user, his ID, the page he is currently on (to send product suggestions for example). To do that, you can define a `window.webchatMethods.getMemory` function, the webchat will call it before sending user messages, and send your arbitrary payload along with the message to the bot.

If you use SAP Conversational AI's bot-builder (you should :)), your payload will be put in the memory of the conversation, meaning that you will be able to access this data in your bot-builder. Let's say you send this as payload : `{ ""userName"": ""Dominik"", ""userId"": 123456 }`, you will then be able to send this as a greeting message : `Hello {{ memory.userName }} ! How do you do ?`.

`window.webchatMethods.getMemory` must return a JSON object or a Promise resolving a JSON object :
  - `{ ""memory"": { ... }, ""merge"": <boolean> }`
where `{ ... }` is your arbitrary payload. `merge` is an instruction for the bot-builder. If set to true, the payload will be merged with the existing memory, overriding common keys but keeping the ones absent from the payload. If set to false, the memory will be replaced entirely by your payload.

If your `getMemory` function takes more than 10 seconds, the message will be sent anyway, without waiting for your function to finish.

#### Examples :
```html
<html>
  <head>
    <script>
      window.webchatMethods = {
        // called at each user message
        getMemory: (conversationId) => {
          const memory = { userName: 'Dominik Bousquet', userId: 123456 }
          return { memory, merge: true }
        }
      }
    </script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <script src=""https://cdn.cai.tools.sap/webchat/webchat.js""
      channelId=""<channelId>""
      token=""<token>""
      id=""cai-webchat""
    ></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

```javascript
window.webchatMethods = {
  getMemory: (conversationId) => {
    const getCookie = (name) => {
      const value = document.cookie.match('(^|;) ?' + name + '=([^;]*)(;|$)')
      return value ? value[2] : null
    }
    const userName = getCookie('userName')
    const memory = { userName, currentUrl: window.location.href }
    return { memory, merge: true }
  }
}
```

```javascript
window.webchatData = {}
window.webchatMethods = {
  getMemory: (conversationId) => {
    if (window.webchatData.savedUserData) {
      return { memory: window.webchatData.savedUserData, merge: true }
    }
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
      axios.get('/current_user')
        .then((response) => {
          const memory = { userName: response.data.name, userId: response.data.id }
          window.webchatData.savedUserData = memory
          resolve({ memory, merge: true })
        })
        .catch(reject)
    })
  }
}
```

```javascript
window.webchatData = {}
window.webchatMethods = {
  getMemory: (conversationId) => {
    if (!window.webchatData.oriUrl) {
      window.webchatData.oriUrl = window.location.href
    }
    // merge: false - reset the conversation if the user
    // switched to another page since the first message
    if (window.webchatData.oriUrl !== window.location.href) {
      return { memory: {}, merge: false }
    }
    return { memory: { userName: 'Dominik' }, merge: true }
  }
}
```

## Introduction

A modern (and portable) approach to inflating view counts in Youtube - using [Puppeteer](https://pptr.dev/),  [TOR](https://www.torproject.org/) rotating proxies and [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).

> **Disclaimer:** This project is intended for informational/educational purposes only. I strictly recommend against using it to artificially inflate video view counts for monetary benefits and/or other use cases that goes against the Youtube Policies & Guidelines and/or the law of the land.

## Prerequisites

 1. Install [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
 2. Install [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
 3. Clone the repo (or download it).
 4. Copy the video urls to `urls.txt` file (**Note**: A line may contain a single URL only)

## Build & Run Steps

The following commands will help create a docker image, build the app and run it -

```console
~$ docker-compose build
~$ docker-compose up --scale ytview=5
```
    
  If you happen to have *npm* in your system, you can also choose to run the app via -

```console
~$ npm run build 
~$ npm start ytview=5
```

## Fine tuning for performance

### Concepts: 

 - **Batch**: Browser instances running in parallel.
 - **Batch Count**: Number of parallel browser instances to run.
 - **View Action**: This represents a single browser instance picking up a fixed number of urls from the pool and visiting them sequentially.
 - **View Action Count**: A single browsing session will watch these many videos sequentially.
 - **Total Count** - Total number of view actions. Ensure this number is exactly divisible by **Batch Count** for optimal resource utilisation.
 - **View Duration** - Average duration in seconds of a single view in view action. Actual view duration will be +/- 16.6% of this number.

You may choose to alter the above params in `utils/constants/index.js` for fine tuning according to your needs. 

Also, the above commands runs 5 docker containers in parallel (which will translate to 5 x **Batch Count** number of Chromium instances running simultaneously) . Adjust this according to how capable your system is.

474,474,scrapinghub/slackbot,Python,"[![PyPI](https://badge.fury.io/py/slackbot.svg)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/slackbot) [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/lins05/slackbot.svg?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/lins05/slackbot)

A chat bot for [Slack](https://slack.com) inspired by [llimllib/limbo](https://github.com/llimllib/limbo) and [will](https://github.com/skoczen/will).

## Features

* Based on slack [Real Time Messaging API](https://api.slack.com/rtm)
* Simple plugins mechanism
* Messages can be handled concurrently
* Automatically reconnect to slack when connection is lost
* [Full-fledged functional tests](tests/functional/test_functional.py)

## Installation


```
pip install slackbot
```

## Usage

### Generate the slack api token

First you need to get the slack api token for your bot. You have two options:

1. If you use a [bot user integration](https://api.slack.com/bot-users) of slack, you can get the api token on the integration page.
2. If you use a real slack user, you can generate an api token on [slack web api page](https://api.slack.com/web).


### Configure the bot
First create a `slackbot_settings.py` and a `run.py` in your own instance of slackbot.

##### Configure the api token

Then you need to configure the `API_TOKEN` in a python module `slackbot_settings.py`, which must be located in a python import path. This will be automatically imported by the bot.

slackbot_settings.py:

```python
API_TOKEN = ""<your-api-token>""
```

Alternatively, you can use the environment variable `SLACKBOT_API_TOKEN`.

##### Run the bot

```python
from slackbot.bot import Bot
def main():
    bot = Bot()
    bot.run()

if __name__ == ""__main__"":
    main()
```

##### Configure the default answer

Add a DEFAULT_REPLY to `slackbot_settings.py`:
```python
DEFAULT_REPLY = ""Sorry but I didn't understand you""
```

##### Configure the docs answer

The `message` attribute passed to [your custom plugins](#create-plugins) has an special function `message.docs_reply()` that will parse all the plugins available and return the Docs in each of them.

##### Send all tracebacks directly to a channel, private channel, or user
Set `ERRORS_TO` in `slackbot_settings.py` to the desired recipient. It can be any channel, private channel, or user. Note that the bot must already be in the channel. If a user is specified, ensure that they have sent at least one DM to the bot first.

```python
ERRORS_TO = 'some_channel'
# or...
ERRORS_TO = 'username'
```

##### Configure the plugins

Add [your plugin modules](#create-plugins) to a `PLUGINS` list in `slackbot_settings.py`:

```python
PLUGINS = [
    'slackbot.plugins',
    'mybot.plugins',
]
```

Now you can talk to your bot in your slack client!

### [Attachment Support](https://api.slack.com/docs/attachments)

```python
from slackbot.bot import respond_to
import re
import json


@respond_to('github', re.IGNORECASE)
def github(message):
    attachments = [
    {
        'fallback': 'Fallback text',
        'author_name': 'Author',
        'author_link': 'http://www.github.com',
        'text': 'Some text',
        'color': '#59afe1'
    }]
    message.send_webapi('', json.dumps(attachments))
```

## Create Plugins

A chat bot is meaningless unless you can extend/customize it to fit your own use cases.

To write a new plugin, simplely create a function decorated by `slackbot.bot.respond_to` or `slackbot.bot.listen_to`:

- A function decorated with `respond_to` is called when a message matching the pattern is sent to the bot (direct message or @botname in a channel/private channel chat)
- A function decorated with `listen_to` is called when a message matching the pattern is sent on a channel/private channel chat (not directly sent to the bot)

```python
from slackbot.bot import respond_to
from slackbot.bot import listen_to
import re

@respond_to('hi', re.IGNORECASE)
def hi(message):
    message.reply('I can understand hi or HI!')
    # react with thumb up emoji
    message.react('+1')

@respond_to('I love you')
def love(message):
    message.reply('I love you too!')

@listen_to('Can someone help me?')
def help(message):
    # Message is replied to the sender (prefixed with @user)
    message.reply('Yes, I can!')

    # Message is sent on the channel
    message.send('I can help everybody!')

    # Start a thread on the original message
    message.reply(""Here's a threaded reply"", in_thread=True)
```

To extract params from the message, you can use regular expression:
```python
from slackbot.bot import respond_to

@respond_to('Give me (.*)')
def giveme(message, something):
    message.reply('Here is {}'.format(something))
```

If you would like to have a command like 'stats' and 'stats start_date end_date', you can create reg ex like so:

```python
from slackbot.bot import respond_to
import re


@respond_to('stat$', re.IGNORECASE)
@respond_to('stat (.*) (.*)', re.IGNORECASE)
def stats(message, start_date=None, end_date=None):
```


And add the plugins module to `PLUGINS` list of slackbot settings, e.g. slackbot_settings.py:

```python
PLUGINS = [
    'slackbot.plugins',
    'mybot.plugins',
]
```

## The `@default_reply` decorator

*Added in slackbot 0.4.1*

Besides specifying `DEFAULT_REPLY` in `slackbot_settings.py`, you can also decorate a function with the `@default_reply` decorator to make it the default reply handler, which is more handy.

```python
@default_reply
def my_default_handler(message):
    message.reply('...')
```

Here is another variant of the decorator:

```python
@default_reply(r'hello.*)')
def my_default_handler(message):
    message.reply('...')
```

The above default handler would only handle the messages which must (1) match the specified pattern and (2) can't be handled by any other registered handler.

You can find a list of the available third party plugins on [this page](https://github.com/lins05/slackbot/wiki/Plugins).

## Config vars
**USE_STOCKFISH_13** : set it to 'true' to use Stockfish 13 ( Heroku / Linux only )  
  
**DISABLE_LOGS** : set it to 'true' to disable logs, when true, logs, position and evaluation will not be shown on home page  
  
**SKIP_FEN** : set it to 'true' to skip calculating fen for current position beyond book depth, when true, fen will only be calculated for positions within book depth, this makes the bot play faster, but the position on the home page will not be shown beyond book depth  
  
**SKIP_AFTER_FAILED** : set it to a positive integer to avoid book lookup after that many failed lookups ( default: don't skip )  
  
**INCREMENTAL_UPDATE** : set it to 'true' to allow incremental update of position for standard games ( by default position is rebuilt from movelist on every move )  
  
**KEEP_ALIVE_URL** : set this to the full link of your bot home page ( https://[yourappname].herokuapp.com , where change [yourappname] to your Heroku app name ) if you want your bot to be kept alive from early morning till late night Heroku server time, keeping alive a free Heroku bot for 24/7 is not possible, because a free Heroku account has a monthly quota of 550 hours  
  
**ALWAYS_ON** : requires paid Heroku account, set it to 'true' to keep the bot alive 24/7, you have to set KEEP_ALIVE_URL to your bot's full home page link for ALWAYS_ON to work ( see also the explanation of KEEP_ALIVE_URL config var )  
  
**ALLOW_CORRESPONDENCE** : set it to 'true' to allow playing correspondence and infinite time control games

# SnapchatBot: A library for making bots that live on Snapchat

Introducing SnapchatBot, an easy way to program Snapchat accounts to do anything you want.
SnapchatBot can be used to create image-based notification services, chatbots, search interfaces,
and any kind of intelligent agent that uses picture messages as its interaction mode.

## Bots Included

#### The Reflector Bot
*(source at examples/reflectorbot.py)*

Sends back everything you send it.

#### The Storifier Bot
*(source at examples/storifierbot.py)*

Takes all the snaps sent to it and adds them to its story. It can be used to collect responses
from multiple people around a single theme, much like a Twitter
hashtag.

#### The Capture Bot (by [EthanBlackburn](https://github.com/EthanBlackburn))
*(source at examples/capturebot.py)*

Saves all snaps received to the current working directory.

#### The Auto-Welcomer Bot
*(source at examples/autowelcomebot.py)*

Sends you an auto-welcome message when you add it to your friends.

#### The Reporter Bot
*(source at examples/reporterbot.py)*

Sends you a snap when breaking news happen. Follows the [BBC Breaking News twitter account](https://twitter.com/bbcbreaking).

#### The Googler Bot
*(source at examples/googlerbot.py)*

When sent an image, sends back the most similar image to that picture on the web. Uses Google Image Search.

#### The GIF Bot
*(source at examples/gifbot.py)*

Posts popular GIFs taken from the [Giphy](http://giphy.com) home page to its story.

#### The Connector Bot
*(source at examples/connectorbot.py)*

When you add the Connector to your friends, it links you with a stranger who's also added it. Every snap sent to the Connector will then arrive at the stranger's inbox, and all snaps sent from the stranger to the Connector will come to you. It's like ChatRoulette on Snapchat.

#### The Rando Bot (by [PhlexPlexico](https://github.com/Phlexplexico))
*(source at examples/randobot.py)*

When you add RandoBot to your friends, it throws you in a list of people who've also added it. When you send it a snap, it will send your snap to a random person in the list. Similar to the [Rando](http://techcrunch.com/2014/03/22/rip-rando/) app.

## Installation

    $ python setup.py install

You also need to have [ffmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/), [ImageMagick](http://www.imagemagick.org/), and [libjpeg](http://libjpeg.sourceforge.net/) installed.

## How to build your own bots

`SnapchatBot` currently supports the following methods:

* `SnapchatBot#send_snap(recipients, snap)` -- sends snap `snap` to the list of usernames `recipients`
* `SnapchatBot#add_friend(username)` -- adds user with username `username` to the bot's friends
* `SnapchatBot#delete_friend(username)` -- deletes user with username `username` from the bot's friends
* `SnapchatBot#block(username)` -- blocks user with username `username`
* `SnapchatBot#get_snaps(mark_viewed = True)` -- gets snaps in the bot's inbox that haven't been viewed yet (use `mark_viewed = False` as a keyword argument if you don't want the bot to mark every snap received as viewed)
* `SnapchatBot#get_my_stories()` -- gets all snaps in the bot's story
* `SnapchatBot#get_friend_stories()` -- gets all the stories of the bot's friends
* `SnapchatBot#clear_stories()` -- deletes all the bot's stories
* `SnapchatBot#mark_viewed(snap)` -- marks `snap` as viewed
* `SnapchatBot#get_friends()` -- gets the bot's friends
* `SnapchatBot#get_added_me()` -- gets all users that have added the bot to their friends
* `SnapchatBot#listen()` -- listens to events (and triggers `on_snap`, `on_friend_add`, or `on_friend_delete`, if they are defined)

To create a snap to send with your bot, either use `Snap.from_file(path_to_file)` with a path
to an image or a video, or create an image with PIL and then use `Snap.from_image(img)`.

To define behaviors for your bot in response to various events (right now only
incoming snaps, friend additions, and friend deletions are supported) subclass `SnapchatBot`
and define any subset of the following methods:

* `initialize` -- run when the bot is created
* `on_snap` -- run when the bot bot receives a snap
* `on_friend_add` -- run when a Snapchat user adds the bot
* `on_friend_delete` -- run when a Snapchat user deletes the bot

To begin listening to events, use the `SnapchatBot#listen` method.

For example, here is the code for the `ReflectorBot`, which simply responds to a snap by sending it
back to the user who sent it:

```python
class ReflectorBot(SnapchatBot):
  # when receiving a snap, sends the same snap back to the sender
  def on_snap(self, sender, snap):
    self.send_snap([sender], snap)

  # when someone adds the bot, the bot adds them back
  def on_friend_add(self, friend):
    self.add_friend(self, friend)

  # when someone deletes the bot, the bot deletes them too
  def on_friend_delete(self, friend):
    self.delete_friend(self, friend)
```

Then to run the bot:

```python
bot = ReflectorBot(<account username>, <account password>)
bot.listen()
```

# Break out the Box (BOtB)
BOtB is a container analysis and exploitation tool designed to be used by pentesters and engineers while also being CI/CD friendly with common CI/CD technologies.


# What does it do?
BOtB is a CLI tool which allows you to:
- Exploit common container vulnerabilities
- Perform common container post exploitation actions
- Provide capability when certain tools or binaries are not available in the Container
- Use BOtB's capabilities with CI/CD technologies to test container deployments
- Perform the above in either a manual or automated approach

## Current Capabilities
- Perform a container breakout via exposed Docker daemons (docker.sock)
- Perform a container breakout via CVE-2019-5736
- Perform a privileged container breakout via enabled CAPS and SYSCALLS
- Extract data from Linux Kernel Keyrings via abusing the Keyctl syscall through permissive seccomp profiles
- Identify Kubernetes Service Accounts secrets and attempt to use them
- Identify metadata services endpoints i.e http://169.254.169.254, http://metadata.google.internal/ and http://100.100.100.200/
- Scrape metadata info from GCP metadata endpoints
- Analyze and identify sensitive strings in ENV and process in the ProcFS i.e /Proc/{pid}/Environ
- Find and Identify UNIX Domain Sockets
- Identify UNIX domain sockets which support HTTP
- Find and identify the Docker Daemon on UNIX domain sockets or on an interface
- Hijack host binaries with a custom payload
- Perform actions in CI/CD mode and only return exit codes > 0
- Push data to an S3 bucket
- Force BOtB to always return a Exit Code of 0 (useful for non-blocking CI/CD)
- Perform the above from the CLI arguments or from a YAML config file
- Perform reverse DNS lookup

### Break out from Container via Exposed Docker Daemon
This approach will breakout into an interactive TTY on the host.
```
#./bob_linux_amd64 -autopwn=true    
[+] Break Out The Box
[+] Attempting to autopwn
[+] Hunting Docker Socks
[+] Attempting to autopwn:  /var/meh

chroot /host && clear
echo 'You are now on the underlying host'
You are now on the underlying host
/ # 
```

### Break out of a Container but in a CI/CD Friendly way
This approach does not escape into a TTY on the host but instead returns an Exit Code > 0 to indicate a successful container breakout.

```
#./bob_linux_amd64 -autopwn=true -cicd=true

### Using BOtB with a YAML config file
Example YAML file cfg.yml

```
payload: id
verbose: false
always-succeed: true
cicd: false
endpointlist: endpoints.txt
wordlist: wordlist.txt
path: /
mode: find-sockets

```
Run BOtB with the above YAML

```
#  ./bob_linux_amd64 -config=cfg.yml
[+] Break Out The Box
[+] Loading Config: cfg.yml
[+] Looking for UNIX Domain Sockets from: /
[!] Valid Socket: /tmp/thisisnotasocket.mock
[+] Finished

```

# Using BOtB with CI\CD
BOtB can be used with CI\CD technologies that make use of exit codes to determine if tests have passed or failed. Below is a Shell script that executes two BOtB tests and the exit codes of the two tests are used to set the exit of the Shell script. If any of the two tests return an Exit Code >0, the test executing the shell script will fail.

```
#!/bin/sh 

exitCode=0

echo ""[+] Testing UNIX Sockets""
./bob_linux_amd64 -autopwn -cicd=true
exitCode=$?

echo ""[+] Testing Env""
./bob_linux_amd64 -recon=true
exitCode=$?

(exit $exitCode)

```
The above script is not the only way to use BOtB with CI\CD technologies but could also be used by itself and not wrapped in a shell script. An example YML config would be:

```
version: 2
cicd:
  runATest: ./bob_linux_amd64 -autopwn -cicd=true
```

Below is an example config that can be used with Heroku CI:

```
{
    ""environments"": {
        ""test"": {
            ""scripts"": {
                ""test"": ""./bob_linux_amd64 -autopwn -cicd=true""
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Below is an example config with Heroku CI but using a wrapper shell script:

```
{
    ""environments"": {
        ""test"": {
            ""scripts"": {
                ""test"": ""./bin/testSocksAndEnv.sh""
            }
        }
    }
}


```

<a href=""#""><img src=""images/bot.png"" 
alt="""" width=""201"" height=""155""/></a>

## About
CryptoBot is an automated, high(ish) frequency trading bot for cryptocurrencies. It uses **Machine Learning** to decide when to trade. Currently it supports only Bitcoins, and trading on the BTCC exchange. In the future I intend on adding other currencies and exchanges.  

This project is a very-hard-fork of Christopher Bynum's BitPredict which can be seen at: https://github.com/cbyn/bitpredict. The base code, and the idea, is modeled off the BitPredict project, so credit is due. However, CryptoBot has evolved immensely and looks very different than BitPredict, and have been taken several steps further.

The project is written entirely in **Python**, with the exception of some shell scripts.

## Details
Data is collected from BTCC using their JSON RPC API, and stored in MongoDB using scripts located in the app/collect_data folder:
- Books snapshot collected every second
- Latest trades collected every second
- Ticks are collected every second
- The run_collect_scripts.sh script can be used to launch it all

Features are created and saved to disk using the create_live_features.py script. The **Machine Learning features** include:
- Width
- Power Imbalance
- Power Adjusted Price
- Trade Count
- Trade Average
- Aggressor
- Trend
- These features were adapted from Christopher Bynum's BitPredict project. More details at: https://github.com/cbyn/bitpredict/ 
- Please feel free to suggest others!?

A target (named ""final"") is created using the future midpoint prices (at 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30 seconds in the future) of the midpoint between bids/asks for the books at those moments: 
- -1 means the average price of future midpoints went down below a certain threshold percentage, after 15 seconds
- +1 means the average price of future midpoints went up above a certain threshold percentage, after 15 seconds
- 0 means the average price did not go up or below the threshold percentage, after 15 seconds

Using the features, we train a Machine Learning **classifier** model (using the strategy.py script) against the target value to give us one of three options:
- -1 means the price is predicted to go down, so trade accordingly
- +1 means the price is predicted to go up, so trade accordingly
- 0 means don't make a trade

I have tried it using the following classifiers:
- **XGBClassifier** from the XGBoost project: https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
- **RandomForestClassifier** from the scikit-learn library: http://scikit-learn.org/
- **GradientBoostingClassifier** from the scikit-learn library
- YMMV, try which one gives you the best results (strategy.py will back test and create the model)

predict.py is used to do the live trading.

## Inner Workings

- A trade is made (position took) and then reversed after 15 seconds
- The balance is kept in a 50/50 split, with 50% as bitcoin and 50% as cash (FIAT)
- When price is predicted to go down, bitcoins are traded for cash, and then bought back at a (hopefully) lower price, yielding a profit in the bitcoin balance.
- When price is predicted to go up, cash is traded for bitcoins, and then the bitcoins are sold back at a (hopefully) higher price, yielding a profit in the cash balance. 
- Keep in mind that orders you make never execute immediately (if ever), which is why we want to take the average of the price midpoints for +/- 15 seconds. In case the trade actually takes places, and reverses, within a 15 second window.
- You will probably need several weeks of data before you can train a classifier to get you any meaningful results.

## Disclaimer
The bot is fully functional. However, this was more of an exercise to teach myself Machine Learning. I have not be able to make a consistent profit. Neither should you expect to. Please be very careful in using this bot, and assume all responsibility yourself. Never use it for trading more than you're willing to lose (i.e. use it for fun only).

## Other Notes
This is very much a work in progress. Contributions are welcome. If you can bring it to a consistent profitability, do share!

# bot

:robot: Aracred Bot to quickly onboard users into an Aracred instance. Don't be afraid to fork and modify this!

## Quickstart

<a href=""https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/aracred/bot"">
<img src=""https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg"" alt=""Deploy"">
</a>

^^ Click here to deploy!

## Quick end-user guide 🦅

Interacting with the bot is simple; it offers 3 commands, all of them starting with the !ac flag:

- ""!ac help"": Shows the available commands, along with an example for each one.

- ""!ac signup"": Signs the user up for generating cred through their contributions, by modifying the `project.json` file in the configured Aracred repo.

- ""!ac addaddress"": Signs the user up for receiving tokens minted to match their generated cred, by modifying the `addressbook.json` file in the configured Aracred repo.

## Developer quick start 👩‍💻

`npm run dev` will launch the bot locally, with hot reloading included.

There are a few other scripts provided:

- `start`: Starts up the bot without hot reloading; used for the heroku deployment described below.
- `lint`: Lints the project with ESLint.
- `test`: Runs all the tests! (If you contribute some code, please do write tests for it ⌨️!)

### Configuration

For the bot to run properly, it needs these variables, laid out in the `.env.sample` file:

- `DISCORD_API_TOKEN`: Your discord API token. [See this guide on how to obtain one](https://github.com/reactiflux/discord-irc/wiki/Creating-a-discord-bot-&-getting-a-token).
- `GITHUB_API_TOKEN`: Your github API token. _This will tie the bot's contributions to your profile_.
- `GITHUB_FILE_PATH`: The ""file path"" to the `project.json` folder, laid out with the format described [here](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/contents/#create-or-update-a-file).
- `GITHUB_ADDRESS_FILE_PATH`: The ""file path"" to the `addressbook.json` folder, laid out with the format described [here](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/contents/#create-or-update-a-file).
- `WHITELISTED_CHANNELS`: The whitelisted channels for the bot to read messages from, in the form of comma separated words, as in `bot,general,channel`. If you want the bot to listen to all channels, set this variable to `*`.

### Deployment

You'll need a service to host this bot 💆‍♀️ but do not despair! There's an easy, already configured way of doing this by deploying it to heroku! Just go through these steps:

- Create a new Heroku app and link it to GitHub
- Search for the repo and connect it
- Enable ""automatic deploys"" for the app
- BONUS: If you want to be able to run this bot 24/7, you can add link your billing info to Heroku, and will give you a 1000 hours for free, enough for a bot instance.

### Contributing

Don't be shy to contribute even the smallest tweak. 🐲 There are still some dragons to be aware of, but we'll be here to help you get started!

This is an experimental, WIP decompilation of *The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild* v1.5.0 (Switch).

**This repository does not contain game assets or RomFS content and *cannot* be used to play *Breath of the Wild*.**

The goal of this project is to better understand game internals, aid with glitch hunting and document existing knowledge in a permanent, unambiguous form which helps further reverse engineer the game.

Considering the large size of the executable (~40MB), it is not expected to reach 100% progress within a reasonable timeframe.

As a result, the project is unlikely to produce a working executable in the near future. It will help with understanding and reverse engineering the game even in its incomplete state, but it will **not** help with playing BotW or porting the game to other platforms, which is **explicitly a non-goal**.

Progress: https://botw.link/progress

## Scope

This project only concerns the main executable which contains all the game code and statically linked libraries. The RomFS and the SDK libraries are *out of the scope* of this project.

* Main executable (main NSO)
    * *Breath of the Wild* code
        * Actual game code (`Game` / uking:: namespace)
        * Framework/engine code (`KingSystem` / ksys:: namespace)
    * Statically linked libraries
        * First-party libraries (e.g. sead, agl, EventFlow, etc.)
        * NintendoSDK inlined utilities
        * Any other statically linked library, except:
            * libcurl
            * NintendoSDK-NEX
            * Havok (physics engine)

Excluded libraries will not be fully decompiled but may be partly re-implemented or decompiled, and (reverse-engineered) headers will still be provided so that the rest of the codebase can still use those libraries.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What is (matching) decompilation?

Decompiling is the process of turning the game's compiled code back into equivalent, readable C++ source code.

Matching decompilation goes one step further and produces original source code that **compiles to the exact same assembly**. This process makes functional correctness extremely easy to verify since the assembly can simply be compared against the original executable. Thanks to Clang, this is easier than one would expect.

#### Matching decomp in this project

Given the impossibility of automatically splitting the assembly and generating a matching binary (as is done in many other decomp projects), the sheer size of the main executable and the usage of many software libraries, this project takes a somewhat experimental approach to matching decompilation.

Because meaningfully splitting the code is not feasible, the built executable currently only contains functions that have been decompiled and no effort is being made to put functions and data at the correct addresses.

Instead of trying to match the entire executable, each function is matched individually and source code is organized in whichever way makes the most sense. Libraries are not treated as being part of the game code, but as external dependencies. The result is that the codebase looks a lot more like a regular software project than a decompilation codebase. Since C++ code makes heavy use of inline functions and zero-cost abstractions that disappear in compiled code, contributors have a lot more leeway when it comes to organizing files and adding abstractions.

### How do you name things?

File names, class or function names, and the file organization come from leftover strings. Unlike some other first-party games such as *Super Mario Odyssey*, all known public versions of U-King are completely stripped, so most names are just more or less educated guesses that try to fill in the blanks.

As more parts of the game get decompiled, it becomes easier to figure out what the rest of the game is doing and equally easier to name functions. It's a positive feedback loop.

### How easy is it to match functions?

Compared to other decomp projects for older compilers: **extremely easy**. Clang is an extremely reasonable compiler with much fewer memes than older compilers such as IDO or older versions of GCC:

* Stack reordering issues are extremely rare, given that AArch64 uses its registers a lot more efficiently. Even when the stack is used, things Just Work™ in the vast majority of cases.
* Pure register allocation (regalloc) issues are almost non-existent. If you see something that looks like a regalloc problem, it usually means your code is not semantically equivalent.
* No `if (1)` shenanigans.
* No ""same line"" memes (codegen being different if two statements are put on the same line).
* Whitespace doesn't matter.

In general, two equivalent constructs that *should* clearly produce the same code actually produce the exact same code. There are exceptions, of course, but many things simply do not matter at all for matching. Inline functions do often affect codegen, though.

Getting perfect matches on the first try happens pretty routinely, even for medium-sized and large functions (>1kB).

Most functions tend to call several other inline functions, notably utility functions from sead; as many core sead modules have already been reversed, decompiling a function sometimes only requires recognizing those function calls: decompilation at a higher level of abstraction!

### Doesn't this mean the end result will be quite inaccurate?

Even though Clang is generally less picky than ancient compilers, it is still able to reveal a lot of interesting information about how the original source code was written.

Granted, Clang will *not* reveal things such as whether developers put two statements on the same line, but in many cases we can still figure how they organised the source code and whether separate inline functions or classes were used.

Coupled with all the strings and all the information C++ language features leak (e.g. classes, virtual functions, hierarchy, etc.), we actually still get relevant, useful info (e.g. abstractions) that *actually* helps understand a modern codebase.

It is also important to remember that this is still a matching decompilation, which means that the code already perfectly matches the original *assembly*; matching functions are guaranteed to be fully equivalent to the original code, and thanks to Clang being picky *where it matters* most of the abstractions should match the original *source*.

### What version is being decompiled?

The Switch 1.5.0 version. Working with Clang is so much nicer than working with the Wii U's proprietary compiler (GHS). And at least an order of magnitude nicer than dealing with most compilers that are used for other matching decomp projects for that matter.

Having access to the Wii U 1.5.0 version is occasionally useful though, because GHS often optimizes and inlines differently, which can help reveal the existence of inline functions.

#### Why not decompile 1.6.0?

Because of aggressive compiler optimisations and severe code bloat, 1.6.0 would be extremely painful to reverse engineer, let alone decompile. [See here](https://gist.github.com/leoetlino/3156c286c7232c2e73b9b74b91021353) for a comparison between 1.5.0 and 1.6.0 code of the main function (called `nnMain`).

(The culprit is link time optimisation, which allows LLVM to perform extremely aggressive inlining even across translation units.)

### I only have 1.6.0. Can I still contribute?

Yes, you can! A delta patch is provided to turn a 1.6.0 executable into 1.5.0, so if you are able to dump 1.6.0 from your console you will also be able to get 1.5.0. Read on for more information...

### Do I need to be a game dev or a C++ expert to contribute?

No, of course not. You only need to be familiar with software development practices and C++, or another language with object-oriented aspects such as Java.

Unlike many other decomp projects, familiary with C or assembly helps but is not required. The reason for this is that BotW is a modern game with many layers of abstractions. Many functions can be decompiled simply by recognizing code patterns / inline functions. Our assembly comparing tool ([asm-differ](https://github.com/simonlindholm/asm-differ)) is also capable of showing what each line of assembly corresponds to in the source code, so you won't get lost in the assembly even if you're unfamiliar with AArch64.

AArch64 assembly is also nicer to deal with than x86/x86-64 and should feel familiar to you if you have already worked with e.g. ARM or MIPS.

This is pretty much an open source project, and even small contributions can make a large difference!

While you certainly do not need to be a C++ expert, you do need to be familiar with basic language features and concepts like namespaces or classes. Otherwise, you will be unable to contribute in any efficient or meaningful way.

### Isn't this risky?

Just like other game decompilations, this project is probably in a legal gray zone. However, the authors of this project believe that it is unlikely to bother NCL for the following reasons:

* Contributing to this repository requires owning the game on a Switch console and dumping the executable.
* This project is completely useless to anybody who does not have the game.
    * It cannot be used to play the game.
    * It does not give you any useful knowledge if you do not play the game or if you do not even have it.
* This repository is only about the executable, which is less than 0.3% of the whole game (ExeFS+RomFS).
* Even if the executable were fully decompiled, it would still not be possible to play the game without dumping the RomFS from a Switch.
* This repository does not contain any original code from the executable.
    * Unlike some decompilation projects for older consoles, not even a single byte of assembly code is included from the original executable.
    * It only contains reimplemented functions that happen to match once compiled.
    * The compiler is Clang, so there are many, many, many ways to write a function and organize things while still getting the exact same code. In fact, while the source code happens to match the compiled code, it is possible and quite likely that the original codebase looks very different from this repository.
* This is a large monolithic game so there is no other way of being accurate to the original logic without doing matching decompilation.
    * Clean room decompilation (having separate teams doing reverse engineering and implementation work) is not a solution when the goal is to follow the original logic as accurately as possible.
* This project does not use any proprietary SDK or any leaked document at all.
    * The compiler is just Clang 4.0.1 which is open source and freely available on [LLVM's website](https://releases.llvm.org/). The SDK compiler is **not** used.
    * Anyone who has had access to leaked information is not allowed to contribute.

### Alright, how do I start contributing?

First, set up the build environment by following the instructions below.

## Building

Reminder: **this will not produce a playable game.** This project will not allow you to play the game if you don't already own it on a Switch.

### For Windows users

While Linux is not a hard requirement, it is strongly advised to [set up WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) to simplify the setup process. Ubuntu 20.04 is usually a good choice.

The instructions below assume that you are using Linux (native or WSL) or macOS.

### 1. Set up dependencies

* Python 3.6 or newer with [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/)
* Ninja
* CMake 3.13+
    * If you are on Ubuntu 18.04, you must first [update CMake by using the official CMake APT repository](https://apt.kitware.com/).
* ccache (to speed up builds)
* xdelta3
* Clang (not for compiling BotW code, but for compiling Rust tools)

Ubuntu users can install those dependencies by running:

```shell
sudo apt install python3 ninja-build cmake ccache xdelta3 clang libssl-dev
```

Additionally, you'll also need:

* A Rust toolchain ([follow the instructions here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install))

* The following Python modules: `capstone colorama cxxfilt pyelftools ansiwrap watchdog python-Levenshtein toml` (install them with `pip install ...`)

### 2. Set up the project

1. Clone this repository. If you are using WSL, please clone the repo *inside* WSL, *not* on the Windows side (for performance reasons).

2. Run `git submodule update --init --recursive`

    Next, you'll need to acquire the **original 1.5.0 or 1.6.0 `main` NSO executable**.

    * To dump it from a Switch, follow [the instructions on the wiki](https://zeldamods.org/wiki/Help:Dumping_games#Dumping_binaries_.28executable_files.29).
    * You do not need to dump the entire game (RomFS + ExeFS + DLC). Just dumping the 1.5.0 or 1.6.0 ExeFS is sufficient.
    * The decompressed 1.5.0 NSO has the following SHA256 hash: `d9fa308d0ee7c0ab081c66d987523385e1afe06f66731bbfa32628438521c106`
        * If you have a compressed NSO or a 1.6.0 executable, don't worry about this.

3. Run `tools/setup.py [path to the NSO]`
    * This will:
        * install tools/check to check for differences in decompiled code
        * convert the executable if necessary
        * set up [Clang 4.0.1](https://releases.llvm.org/download.html#4.0.1) by downloading it from the official LLVM website
        * create a build directory in `build/`
    * If something goes wrong, follow the instructions given to you by the script.

### 3. Build

To start the build, just run

```shell
ninja -C build
```

By default, Ninja will perform a multithreaded build. There is no need to pass -j manually.

To check whether everything built correctly, just run `tools/check` after the build completes.

[![License: AGPL v3](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-AGPL%20v3-blue.svg)](./LICENSE)

Telegram Bot that allows you to play the popular card game UNO via inline queries. The bot currently runs as [@unobot](http://telegram.me/unobot).

To run the bot yourself, you will need: 
- Python (tested with 3.4+)
- The [python-telegram-bot](https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot) module
- [Pony ORM](https://ponyorm.com/)

## Setup
- Get a bot token from [@BotFather](http://telegram.me/BotFather) and change configurations in `config.json`.
- Convert all language files from `.po` files to `.mo` by executing the bash script `compile.sh` located in the `locales` folder.
  Another option is: `find . -maxdepth 2 -type d -name 'LC_MESSAGES' -exec bash -c 'msgfmt {}/unobot.po -o {}/unobot.mo' \;`.
- Use `/setinline` and `/setinlinefeedback` with BotFather for your bot.
- Use `/setcommands` and submit the list of commands in commandlist.txt
- Install requirements (using a `virtualenv` is recommended): `pip install -r requirements.txt`

You can change some gameplay parameters like turn times, minimum amount of players and default gamemode in `config.json`.
Current gamemodes available: classic, fast and wild. Check the details with the `/modes` command.

Then run the bot with `python3 bot.py`.

Code documentation is minimal but there.

# A multi-function bot, written in OCaml #

Most of the functions of this bot are used in the development of Coq.
A subset of functions (most notably the ability to synchronize GitHub
pull requests to GitLab branches and report back the results of
continuous integration) are used in dozens of additional projects.

This is a work in progress and your help is welcome, both in the form
of issues and pull requests.  When reporting a bug or requesting a
feature, please be as specific as possible, and be ready to follow up.
If you are not ready to follow up to make your needs more explicit, or
to help with testing, don't bother requesting a new feature in the
first place.

## Features ##

### Synchronization between GitHub and GitLab ###

GitLab is not just a development platform similar to GitHub, it is
also one of the best CI providers there is today.  Consequently, it is
no surprise that many projects that are developed on GitHub want to
use GitLab for CI/CD.  Since 2018, [GitLab CI/CD supports
GitHub][gitlab-github-support], but this only means mirroring the
repository's branches and reporting status checks back.  Pull requests
originating from forks get no testing, even though this has been a
[feature request][gitlab-fork-issue] for more than two years.

[gitlab-github-support]: https://about.gitlab.com/solutions/github/
[gitlab-fork-issue]: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/5667

#### Synchronize pull requests from forks ####

This bot works around this issue by pushing new and updated pull
requests to branches on the GitLab mirror.  Note that depending on
your settings this could result in a security risk.  In particular, if
you have secret variables, you should restrict them to protected
branches.  Otherwise, anyone could instrument pull request testing to
get access to their values.

![pushed branch screenshot](screenshots/pushed-branch.png)

#### Automatic merge commits for testing ####

Like Travis, the bot always create a merge commit of the pull request
head with the head of the base branch, which is very convenient when
the pull request is not up-to-date with the base branch.  If the
automatic merge fails, then the bot will push a failed status check on
the PR and set a ""needs: rebase"" label (if this labels exists).  It
also removes the label when an updated version without conflicts is
pushed.

![needs rebase label screenshot](screenshots/needs-rebase.png)

#### Detailed failure reporting ####

In the reverse direction, the bot will substitute itself to the status
check reporting that GitLab supports, and report more detailed
information on failing pipelines (with a direct link to the failed
jobs).

![detailed reporting screenshot](screenshots/detailed-reporting.png)

Using the status check reporting provided by this bot rather than the
one provided by GitLab is essential, because GitLab wouldn't know how
to report the status back for automatic merge commits.

#### GitHub Checks features ####

When the bot is installed as a [GitHub App](#as-a-github-app), it uses
the GitHub Checks tab for the status reporting.  You get some
additional benefits, like having a snippet of the failed build logs
and the ability to restart failed jobs and pipelines by clicking on
the ""Re-run"" button.

![re-run button](screenshots/re-run.png)

The GitHub App is also able to report failed jobs in `allow_failure`
mode as ""neutral"" status checks.

![neutral check](screenshots/neutral-check.png)

#### Other GitHub-GitLab synchronization features ####

The bot can also add direct link to artifacts generated by the CI to
ease reviewing.  For now, this feature is only activated on the Coq
repository.  Please open an issue if you would like to use it on your
repository too.

![direct link to CI artifact](screenshots/link-to-artifact.png)

The bot will delete branches corresponding to pull requests when the
pull requests are merged or closed.

![branch deletion screenshot](screenshots/deleted-branch.png)

Finally, the bot handles some cases of spurious failures by
relaunching the failed job automatically, for instance in case of
runner failure.  At some point in the past, shared runner failures
were very frequent and this feature was absolutely necessary to make
GitLab CI/CD usable in practice.

Please open an issue if you would like any of the behaviors described
above to be configurable.

### Clear milestone of unmerged pull requests ###

When a pull request is closed without being merged, the bot will
remove any milestone that had been set.

![milestone removal screenshot](screenshots/removed-milestone.png)

Please open an issue if you would like this behavior to be
configurable.

### Mark pull request as stale and automatically close them ###

If this feature is used, the bot will mark pull requests as stale when
they have not been rebased for more than 30 days, with a comment
giving another 30 days to rebase the pull request before it is
automatically closed.

![stale pull request](screenshots/stale-pull-request.png)

To use the feature, create the `needs: rebase` and the `stale` labels
and set up a cron job (e.g. a scheduled GitHub Action) to call the
`/check-stale-pr` endpoint every day with `owner:repo` in the body.

This feature is best used in combination with a GitHub Action to
automatically add the `needs: rebase` label when a conflict appears
after the base branch has been updated.  Example:

```yml
name: ""Check conflicts""
on: [push]
# Only on push because @coqbot already takes care of checking for
# conflicts when PRs are opened or synchronized

jobs:
  main:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: eps1lon/actions-label-merge-conflict@b8bf8341285ec9a4567d4318ba474fee998a6919
        with:
          dirtyLabel: ""needs: rebase""
          repoToken: ""${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}""
```

### Synchronize closed issue's milestone with the one of the pull request that closed it ###

If an issue is closed automatically when merging a pull request, and
this pull request had a milestone set, then the bot will add the issue
to the same milestone.  If the issue was already in a different
milestone, the bot will change the milestone and post a comment
alerting of the change.

![updated milestone screenshot](screenshots/changed-milestone.png)

This feature won't be activated if you don't select the ""issue"" event
when configuring the GitHub webhook.  However, it is activated if you
installed the bot as a [GitHub App](#as-a-github-app).  Please open an
issue if you would like this behavior to be configurable.

### Post comment when a pull request does not respect certain standards ###

This feature is only activated on the Coq repository.  Please open an
issue if you would like to use it on your repository too.

When someone opens a pull request but the name of the branch that was
used to open the pull request is the same as the base branch, the bot
posts a comment recommending to do differently next time, and suggests
reading the contributing guide.

![pull request recommendation screenshot](screenshots/pr-recommendation.png)

### Manage the backporting process ###

This is a complex feature that is not activated by default, and that
would deserve a whole document to present it.  Please open an issue if
you are interested in hearing about it.

## How to use the **@coqbot** instance ##

### As a GitHub App

This is the recommended installation method, as this is both easier to
set up and it gives access to new features (related to GitHub Checks).

Notes:

- Installation as a GitHub App is still in an experimental stage
and you may frequently receive requests to expand permissions.

- All the repositories that use the bot and belong to the same
owner must install the bot using the same method (GitHub App or
regular user).

- If you were previously using the legacy installation method,
make sure you disable any previously set up GitHub webhooks when
switching to the GitHub App, otherwise the bot will receive every
request twice.

The bot can be installed as a GitHub App to either your account or
organization ([link to app](https://github.com/apps/coqbot-app)).
Once you finish the installation, follow these steps:

- Create a repository on GitLab.com which will be used to run CI jobs.

  The bot will only take care of mirroring the PRs and reporting
  status checks back so you may still want to activate the mirroring
  feature for the main branches.  To do so, the easiest way is to
  choose the ""CI/CD for external repo"" option when creating the GitLab
  repository.  However, you should opt to give the repo by URL rather
  than with the GitHub button, because we won't need GitLab's own
  status check reporting feature. (If it is already activated, you can
  disable this integration in the ""Settings"" / ""Integration"" menu).

- In your GitLab repository:

  - go to ""Members"" to add
    [**@coqbot**](https://gitlab.com/coqbot) as a project member with
    ""Developer"" role (so that it can push new branches).

  - go to ""Settings"" / ""Webhooks"" and create one webhook that will be
    triggered by pipeline events and job events. Set its URL to
    <https://coqbot.herokuapp.com/gitlab>.

  By default, **@coqbot** considers that both GitHub and GitLab repositories
  share the same URL except for the ""lab"" replacing the ""hub"" part. If
  that is not the case, assuming you created a GitLab repository whose
  URL is <https://gitlab.com/owner/repo/>, add a file `coqbot.toml` at
  the root of your GitHub repository and in its default branch (most often
  named `master`), containing:
  ```
  [mapping]
  gitlab = ""owner/repo""
  ```
  If you use other instance of **@coqbot**, this repository-specific
  configuration file becomes `BOT_NAME.toml` where `BOT_NAME` is the name
  of the bot.

### As a regular user account (legacy)

The bot used to be given access to each of your GitHub repositories as a
regular GitHub user account (**@coqbot**). This installation method is
still supported for repositories that haven't migrated to the GitHub App
yet. Here are the steps to follow in addition to those described in the 
`As GitHub App` section:

- In your GitHub repository:

  - go to ""Settings"" / ""Manage access"" to add
    [**@coqbot**](https://github.com/coqbot) as a collaborator with
    the ""Write"" role (so that it can push status checks, and set
    labels).

    Currently, every invitation requires a manual validation, so there
    may be some lag before **@coqbot** can push status checks
    to your repository.

  - go to ""Settings"" / ""Webhooks"" and add one webhook with URL
    <https://coqbot.herokuapp.com/github> that will only be triggered
    at least by pull request events, and if you want to use the issue
    milestone feature, by issue events as well.  Make sure you change
    the ""content/type"" value to ""application/json"".

  

## Architecture ##

The bot has grown according to the needs for automation in the Coq
project, initially as a single file, and is now incrementally being
rearchitected around the idea of providing a library of base bot
components that can be used in a trigger-action programming model.

The most popular trigger-action programming platforms as of today are
IFTTT and Zapier.  Interestingly both of them provide a GitHub
integration, and Zapier provides a GitLab integration as well, but
their integrations do not include sufficiently advanced triggers nor
actions to perform the kind of things that this bot does.

The bot components are of three types (the naming follows [GraphQL's
terminology][graphql-terms] of the corresponding GraphQL requests,
GraphQL requests are preferred to REST requests whenever possible):

- **Subscriptions** are the events that the bot listens to (currently
  GitHub and GitLab webhooks).  See for instance
  `bot-components/GitHub_subscriptions.ml`.

- **Queries** are the requests that are sent to gather additional
  necessary information, and to decide whether the conditions to
  perform an action are met.  See for instance
  `bot-components/GitHub_queries.ml`.

- **Mutations** are the state-changing actions that are performed by
  the bot, in response to some event and some conditions being met.
  See for instance `bot-components/GitHub_mutations.ml`.

[graphql-terms]: https://graphql.github.io/graphql-spec/June2018/#sec-Language.Operations

When this architecture is sufficiently stable, the goal is to publish
the `bot-components` folder as an independent library of building
blocks to create a personalized bot in OCaml.  In the meantime, if you
deploy your own instance, the `callback` function in the `bot.ml` file
is the main entry point, where you can decide of your business
logic by choosing the subscriptions you listen to, and by triggering
the relevant queries and mutations on demand.

## How to deploy a new instance ##

Creating an instance of the bot requires to create a
[GitHub App](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/creating-a-github-app) and set up a server.

### Deploying the server

We provide a Docker image at each release, which can be easily deployed
to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/). Simply follow the official
[instructions](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/container-registry-and-runtime).

The bot will need to read a few environment variables so make sure
these are configured in your Heroku app:

- `GITLAB_ACCESS_TOKEN`
- `GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN`
- `GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET`
- `GITHUB_PRIVATE_KEY` (a private key of your GitHub app)
- `GITHUB_APP_ID` (your GitHub App ID)

Then, you must configure the bot with a configuration file. Here is an example
to adapt to your needs [`example-config.toml`](example-config.toml)).

Here is an example of Dockerfile to build a personalized image based
on a release image from GitHub packages, using a custom `bot_config.toml`
configuration file:
```dockerfile
FROM docker.pkg.github.com/coq/bot/coqbot:v0.2.0

COPY path/to/bot_config.toml ./

EXPOSE 8000 # The port you specified in bot_config.toml
            # (this command is ignored if you deploy to Heroku)

CMD [""./bot.exe"", ""bot_config.toml""]
```
Keep in mind that you should login first to GitHub packages with your
GitHub credentials.

### Create a GitHub App

Please follow the [instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/creating-a-github-app)
for creating a GitHub App.

Make sure to enter the address of your instance of the server followed by `/github` in the
`Webhook URL` entry. It typically looks like `https://myapp.herokuapp.com/github` if you
deployed the server to Heroku.

You can also specify the `Webhook Secret`, which should correspond to the `GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET`
environment variable.

Then, you need to set the following permissions:

- Repository permissions:
  - Checks: read & write
  - Contents: read & write
  - Issues: read & write
  - Metadata: read-only
  - Pull requests: read & write
  - Projects: read & write
  - Commit statuses: read & write

- Organization permissions:
  - Members: read-only
  - Projects: read & write

- Subscribe to events (check the following events):
  - Check run
  - Commit comment
  - Create
  - Issue comment
  - Issues
  - Project
  - Project card
  - Project column
  - Pull request
  - Pull request review
  - Push

## Installing Ruby

### Windows

There's an installer, it's easy.
http://rubyinstaller.org/

### Mac

Newer macs ship with a usable version of Ruby.

Try `ruby -v` in a terminal window, and if it's 1.9.x or 2.x you're fine.

489,489,jsdelivr/bot,Python,"jsDelivr bot
=============

The bot which validates and comments on PRs, squashs commits and merges submissions.

### Why

Couple reasons: we wanted something even faster than **@jimaek** (he usually took a about a minute whereas the bot is under a second), bigger than **@jimaek** (checks more things than a human can), better than **@jimaek** (can squash commits before merging), and stronger than **@jimaek** (the bot defers to other mods for help if unsure) =D

#### Why not travis/jenkins etc

Could of be done, but it would have been much, much slower to validate and be difficult to support issue comment hooks (actions when a mod wants a pr squashed) and auto merging. The nice thing about bot is it only interacts with the Github API and avoids cloning the repo most of the time.

### How

Born out of a drunk weekend adventure to replace **@jimaek** with the github API, github3.py, and the jsDelivr API

### Usage

Note: squashing requires [`git-extras`](https://github.com/tj/git-extras)

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Adjust `config.yml` as necessary (tokens, user name, repo clone path, etc)

Run server on port 9000
```sh
./run.py

#Background
nohup ./run.py &
```

```sh
./cli <pull-request-number>
```

</details>

<details>

  <summary> • THE NORMAL WAY • </summary>

Simply clone the repository and run the main file:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/H1M4N5HU0P/MAFIA-USERBOT.git
cd MAFIA-USERBOT
virtualenv -p /usr/bin/python3 venv
. ./venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
# <Create local_config.py with variables as given below>
python3 -m userbot
```

An example `local_config.py` file could be:

**Not All of the variables are mandatory**

__The Userbot should work by setting only the first two variables__

```python3
from heroku_config import Var

class Development(Var):
  APP_ID = 6
  API_HASH = ""eb06d4abfb49dc3eeb1aeb98ae0f581e""
```

</details>

<details>

  <summary> • UNIBORG CONFIGURATION • </summary>

The UniBorg Config is situated in `userbot/uniborgConfig.py`.

**Heroku Configuration**
Simply just leave the Config as it is.

**Local Configuration**
Fortunately there are no Mandatory vars for the UniBorg Support Config.

</details>

<details>

  <summary> • MANDATORY VARS • </summary>

- Only two of the environment variables are mandatory.
- This is because of `telethon.errors.rpc_error_list.ApiIdPublishedFloodError`
    - `APP_ID`:   You can get this value from https://my.telegram.org
    - `API_HASH`:   You can get this value from https://my.telegram.org
- The userbot will not work without setting the mandatory vars.

## How to install strategies

```
$ git clone https://github.com/cloggy45/Gekko-Bot-Resources.git

$ cd gekko && npm i convnetjs moment gauss lodash.ismatch cluster mathjs numbro stats-lite zero-fill convnetjs tulind
```
# helper.js Guide

The ```helper.js``` includes a collection of modules that I find myself creating each time I make a strategy.

## How to install helper.js

You need to add the ```helper.js``` file to the root of your Gekko folder, then add ``var helper = require('../helper.js');`` to the top of your strategy.


### Trailing Stop Loss

>""A trailing stop order sets the stop price at a fixed amount below the market price with an attached ""trailing"" amount. As the market price rises, the stop price rises by the trail amount, but if the stock price falls, the stop loss price doesn't change, and a market order is submitted when the stop price is hit.""

#### Instructions

We initialize our trailing stop loss in our init function in our strategy like so:
```javascript
strat.init = function() {
    this.stopLoss = helper.trailingStopLoss();
    .....
```  
We create a trailing stop anytime we make a purchase according to the various indicators we set up in our strategy.

```javascript
this.stopLoss.create(somePercentage, currentPrice);
```

We destroy our trailing stop after any time we call ```this.advice('short')```

```javascript
this.stopLoss.destroy();
```
We must also check on each candle to see if our trailing stop loss has triggered, we can do it like so:
```javascript
strat.check = function(candle) {
	const currentPrice = candle.close;
	if(this.stopLoss.isTriggered(currentPrice)) {
		this.advice('short');
	    this.stopLoss.destroy();
	} else {
	    this.stopLoss.update(currentPrice);
	}
	.....
```
We would place the above code in our check function in our strategy.

A PHP library to help you work with your Pinterest account without API credentials. 

The Pinterest API is painful: receiving an access token involves registering a developer account, 
registering an application, then waiting for confirmation. Not to mention, the
public API itself is poorly implemented and has a limited set of features. 

This library offers the full functionality available on Pinterest's website, with **no need to register an
application to receive an access token**. All that's needed is your account login information (but even this is not required
if you don't plan on creating pins, writing comments or sending messages)!

## Installation

### Dependencies
Library requires CURL extension and PHP 7.0 or above.

The recommended way to install this library is via [Composer](https://getcomposer.org). 
[New to Composer?](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md)

```
composer require seregazhuk/pinterest-bot
```

## Quick Start

```php 
// You may need to amend this path to locate Composer's autoloader
require('vendor/autoload.php'); 

use seregazhuk\PinterestBot\Factories\PinterestBot;

$bot = PinterestBot::create();

// Login
$bot->auth->login('mypinterestlogin', 'mypinterestpassword');

// Get lists of your boards
$boards = $bot->boards->forUser('yourUserName');

// Create a pin
$bot->pins->create('http://exmaple.com/image.jpg', $boards[0]['id'], 'Pin description');
```

*Note*: Some methods (e.g. get user followers/following, pins
likes/dislikes, search and other feed queries) use Pinterest navigation through results (with bookmarks). This means that for every batch of results, a 
call is made to Pinterest and a [Pagination](#pagination) object with Pinterest API results is returned.

## How to avoid ban

**To avoid being banned by Pinterest**, do not aggressively pin or write comments (e.g. creating hundreds of pins in a single minute).
Do this by inserting timeouts (`sleep($seconds)`) with calls.

## Examples
These articles provide examples of common tasks that can be performed with the bot:

 - [Automate pinning](http://seregazhuk.github.io/2017/03/25/build-pinterest-bot-with-php-auto-pin/) ([source code](examples/auto_pins.php))
 - [Multiple Accounts and Proxy](http://seregazhuk.github.io/2017/03/28/build-printerest-bot-with-php-multiple-accounts/) ([source code](examples/multiple_accounts_and_proxy.php))
 - [Comments, Likes And Repins](http://seregazhuk.github.io/2017/03/30/build-pinterest-bot-with-php-comments-and-repins/) ([source code](examples/comments_likes_repins.php))
 - [Followers](http://seregazhuk.github.io/2017/04/01/build-pinterest-bit-with-php-followers/) ([source code](examples/followers.php))
 - [Parsing Pins](http://seregazhuk.github.io/2017/04/04/build-pinterest-bot-with-php-parsing-pins/) ([source code](examples/pins_parser.php))

### Selfbots are officially banned. For more information, see [here](https://github.com/RayzrDev/SharpBot/issues/116#issuecomment-335036210).

**SharpBot** was an ever-expanding [Discord](http://discordapp.com) selfbot powered by [Discord.js](https://discord.js.org/#/) that had a bunch of fun and useful commands. From automating boring tasks with shortcuts to fetching a random cat picture from the internet, SharpBot had it all! Features included Google searching, fetching extended information about users and servers, dice rolls, quoting messages, setting your game, shortening URLs, keeping track of your todo list, embedding messages, generating memes, and so much more. Sadly, none of this is possible anymore due to technical changes in Discord's internals.

![SharpBot installer GIF](res/sharpbot.gif)

## Credits
The bot was originally a modified version of [eslachance's djs-selfbot-v9](https://github.com/eslachance/djs-selfbot-v9), but over time I've completely rewritten it. The commands are a compilation of my own work as well as snippets found online.

[![SonarCloud](https://sonarcloud.io/api/project_badges/measure?project=BotFarm&metric=alert_status)](https://sonarcloud.io/dashboard?id=BotFarm)

Console application used to spawn multiple WoW automated players.

Credit for the authentication process and the base implementation goes to mangos, WCell, PseuWoW and TrinityCore.

The application configuration is setup by editing the *.config file in the output folder:
- fill the [Username](BotFarm/App.config#L17) and [Password](BotFarm/App.config#L20) fields with an account with "".account create"" permissions to allow the BotFarm to automatically create new accounts when required. Make sure this account has already a character.
- fill the [Min](BotFarm/App.config#L35)/[MaxBotsCount](BotFarm/App.config#L32) with the amount of bots you want to connect at same time. This will automatically create new accounts when required
- set paths for [MAPsFolderPath](BotFarm/App.config#L44), [VMAPsFolderPath](BotFarm/App.config#L41), [MMAPsFolderPath](BotFarm/App.config#L38) and [DBCsFolderPath](BotFarm/App.config#L47)
- make sure to read [README.md in BotFarm/lib folder](BotFarm/lib/README.md) too with additional steps about required dependencies

Write ""stats"" in the console to view some statistics about the current status of bots.
Write ""quit"" to cleanly shut down the application and persist the new connection infos to botsinfos.xml file.

Windows x64 binaries built with Visual Studio 2015 can be downloaded at [https://ci.appveyor.com/project/jackpoz/botfarm/build/artifacts](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/jackpoz/botfarm/build/artifacts), make sure to install [Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2015](https://www.microsoft.com/en-US/download/details.aspx?id=48145) first.

502,502,Spandan-Madan/Me_Bot,Jupyter Notebook,"# Me_Bot
A simple tool to make a bot that speaks like you, simply learning from your WhatsApp Chats.

Instructions:-

1. From WhatsApp on your phone, go to any chat and export it by going into the settings. Move the txt file that you receive inside the Me_Bot folder.

2. Run the clean_whatsapp_chats.py script using the command. Before running, change the names of the people by changing YOUR_NAME and OTHER_NAME in the scripts according to the txt file you have for your chats.

`python clean_whatsapp_chats.py whatsapp_chat.txt`

3. Run the prepare_files.ipynb ipython notebook.

4. Run the Me_Bot.ipynb file and you can play with the bot at the bottom!

NOTE - Actively seeking collaborators for fun side projects like this. If you're itnerested, please drop me a mail at smadan@mit.edu

## For wechat user:
Wechat chat history is save in SQLite Database, therefore you need to export from you Phone.
Basically, if you have a iPhone, there are the steps to get the database file:
1. Use iTunes to backup your phone (unselect encrypt backup)
2. Use iTools to open the backup file and get a copy of your database file named MM.sqlite
3. run `python clean_wechat_chats.py YOUR_DATABASE_PATH YOUR_FRIEND_ID`

Find more detail information about this [here](https://www.cnblogs.com/cxun/p/5677606.html)

![MM.sqlite](https://github.com/DH-Diego/Me_Bot/blob/master/pictures/MM.sqlite.png)

This is the database, each table starts with 'Chat_' corresponding to a chat history with a friend,  you need to find the table id you want to generate the chat robot to run the script above. Currently only English chat is supported, Chinese version is under constructing.

```
### One command
To install everything in one command (useful for VPS deployment) on Debian-based distros, use:
```sh
#https://github.com/yagop/telegram-bot/wiki/Installation
sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get upgrade -y --force-yes; sudo apt-get dist-upgrade -y --force-yes; sudo apt-get install libreadline-dev libconfig-dev libssl-dev lua5.2 liblua5.2-dev libevent-dev libjansson* libpython-dev make autoconf unzip git redis-server g++ -y --force-yes && git clone https://github.com/SEEDTEAM/TeleSeed.git && cd TeleSeed && chmod +x launch.sh && ./launch.sh install && ./launch.sh
```
### Realm configuration

After you run the bot for first time, send it `!id`. Get your ID and stop the bot.

Open ./data/config.lua and add your ID to the ""sudo_users"" section in the following format:
```
  sudo_users = {
    110626080,
    103649648,
    111020322,
    0,
    YourID
  }
```
Then restart the bot.

Create a realm using the `!createrealm` command.

506,506,SeanDaBlack/KelloggBot,TeX,"# KelloggBot
[Setup](#setup)\
[Usage](#usage)

Credit to SeanDaBlack for the basis of the script.

main.py is selenium python bot.
sc.js is a the base of the ios shortcut [COMING SOON]

# Setup

On mac/pc:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

This will install `webdriver-manager` to automatically download the correct chrome driver. If you are having issues opening having it open chrome, check https://github.com/SergeyPirogov/webdriver_manager.

Poppler must be installed for pdf2image. Follow the instructions at https://pdf2image.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html to install.

You will also need to install ffmpeg if it is not already installed: [Mac installation guide](https://superuser.com/a/624562) [Windows installation guide](https://www.wikihow.com/Install-FFmpeg-on-Windows)

LaTeX must also be installed for resume generation. If you're unsure where to start with that, follow the [official instructions](https://www.latex-project.org/get/). (Mac users: I'd recommend using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) to install [BasicTex](https://formulae.brew.sh/cask/basictex#default).)

`python main.py` to run. It will loop until you kill the job. `ctrl + c` in your terminal to give HR a break (optional).

Mac:

You might also get a trust issue with the downloaded driver being unverified. To fix that, run 

`xattr -d com.apple.quarantine chromedriver`

this just tells the OS it's safe to use this driver, and Selenium will start working. See https://timonweb.com/misc/fixing-error-chromedriver-cannot-be-opened-because-the-developer-cannot-be-verified-unable-to-launch-the-chrome-browser-on-mac-os/ for more info.

# Usage
```
usage: A script to automate very legitimate applications to kellogg's production plants affected by union strikes
       python3 main.py [-h] [--debug] [--mailtm]

options:
  -h, --help  show this help message and exit
  --debug     Puts script in a 'debug' mode where the Chrome GUI is visible
  --mailtm    Uses mail.tm instead of guerrilla mail by default

Kellogg bad | Union good | Support strike funds

507,507,dsgriffin/opensea-sales-twitter-bot,JavaScript,"# OpenSea Sales Twitter Bot 🤖

A (quickly put together) bot that monitors Opensea sales for a given collection & then posts them to Twitter.

**⚠️ IMPORTANT -** If you're looking to track sales across multiple marketplaces (LooksRare etc.), see [NFT Sales Twitter Bot](https://github.com/dsgriffin/nft-sales-twitter-bot)

## Donations 💵

If you find this script/repo useful for your project, any ETH/Altcoin/NFT donations are greatly appreciated 🙏

Eth Address: 0xDCA88f66CEc8972D23DE7d5e69c40E087C92132f

## Requirements 📝

- [Twitter Developer Account](https://developer.twitter.com/en/apply-for-access) (with [Elevated Access](https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/products/elevated), as we need v1.1 endpoint access)

- A OpenSea API Key (request one [here](https://docs.opensea.io/reference/api-overview))

- Heroku Account (a free account **should** be fine **if** you tweak the project to run less often than every minute (by default it is every minute), otherwise a $7 a month dyno instance is more than enough).

## Setup 🔧

- Clone/Fork/Copy this project to your local public/private git repo

- Create a Twitter Developer App (make sure you change it to have both read/write permissions)

- Create a new Heroku app & set it as a remote branch of your git repo (see [Heroku Remote](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/git#creating-a-heroku-remote))

- Make sure you are logged in to the Twitter account you want the bot to run on (as the next step will be authorizing the bot to post on your account)

- Install [Twurl](https://github.com/twitter/twurl) and, using your Twitter Developer consumer key & secret, generate the access token & access secret

In the Settings section of your Heroku app you'll see a Config Vars section. Add the following config vars:

- **CONSUMER_KEY** - Your Twitter Developer App's Consumer Key
- **CONSUMER_SECRET** - Your Twitter Developer App's Consumer Secret
- **ACCESS_TOKEN_KEY** - The Access Token Key of the Twitter Account your bot is posting from
- **ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET** - The Access Token Secret of the Twitter Account your bot is posting from
- **OPENSEA_COLLECTION_SLUG** - The OpenSea collection name you wish to track (e.g. `cryptopunks`)
- **X_API_KEY** - Your unique OpenSea API key

Now you're ready to release - just push up the code via. git to the Heroku remote (see [Heroku Remote](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/git#creating-a-heroku-remote) if unsure how).

Make sure you are using `worker` dynos and not `web` dynos - you can set this in the CLI your project with:

```sh
heroku ps:scale web=0
heroku ps:scale worker=1
```

## Modification 🛠

By default I am just include the name, price in eth & usd, a hashtag or two and a link to the NFT on OpenSea. Check out the [OpenSea Events API](https://docs.opensea.io/reference#retrieving-asset-events) if you want to include additional info (such as seller/buyer addresses etc.).

There is `tweetWithImage` function that you can use instead of the default `tweet` method if you prefer - this will display the full image file as part of the tweet, instead of the standard OpenSea preview image.

In `app.js`, on line 24 you can see there's a commented out conditional if you'd like to only tweet out sales above a certain amount of Eth.

As mentioned at the top of the README, it runs every 60 seconds by default - you can change this to run less often if you'd like to keep it on a free Heroku instance.

Hello all of you guys should get some clarification about me and bot's current situation.\
The account on which I was fishing has been permanently banned today (2021.04.11)\
I'm not going to risk 'testing' the bot on the main account.\
\
**for this reason, I suspend any further work on the bot. I don't want more people to get banned because of me**\
\
As a summary, I would like to thank you all with responding to problems and building the bot :)\
especially @syntax001 @NewWorldDev @ITgamers and @srhinos you did a pretty good job.

  * Bitcoin Wallet addess: 3KpsEkGrMz1F9uxSgDbw92jvGqa5JoQpEC
  * ETH Wallet addess: 0x335d217961a839899ee03a9a78b56fb77cba95b3\
  Thank you for your support, i gonna buy some coke for that :DD

# Usage guide
* Before you start fishing you need to indicate correct fishing positions\
  The left ('Fishing') panel inputs are the pointing area where fishing icons are going to appear\
  The best way to configure it is to open the game, stand over the fishing ground\
  set a rectangle so that most of it is on the right side of the character, and set the appropriate height\
  ![alt text](https://i.imgur.com/asa3EBo.png)
* The smaller the rectangle, the faster the program will run - because it will have fewer pixels to check\
  I strongly suggest setting the repair/bait positions at this point as well\
  Just open the inventory, and set positions so that it completely covers the rod\
  ![alt text](https://i.imgur.com/4tdJxPA.png)
* Do the same, for the bait buttons\
  ![alt text](https://i.imgur.com/3NZ5tg5.png)
* Now all you have to do is click the ‘Start fishing’ button and move the mouse cursor into the game window.

# Personalization guide
* Repairing functionality will work every interval you set on the panel and is activated while searching for a fish\
  Each interval, starting with casting the fishing rod, retrieving the fish, opening the inventory for repairs, is possible to change\
  Close app, go to your installation folder, open resources and open config.xml with any text editor you have\
  ![alt text](https://i.imgur.com/0yR6nIM.png)
* As you can see there are values that you assigned a moment ago. What interests you are all the values\
  appearing after the line 'timeouts'. Each timeout will be a random number in the range of min and max.
  And their properties are listed here: (All values are given in seconds)
1. loop is responsible for the breaks between successive iterations of the program. I recommend leaving it at 0.0.1
2. notice is a left mouse click duration when fish is found
3. reeling is a left mouse click duration when the green icon is visible
4. pause tells you how much time the program should 'release' when it sees a brown or red icon
5. cast is a left mouse click duration of casting the fishing rod.
6. arm_disarm - time the program will wait before/after arming/disarming the rod
7. inventory - time the program will wait before/after opening/closing your inventory
8. repair - time the program will wait before/after clicking the fishing rod
9. confirm - time the program will wait before/after confirming repair
10. move_around - time the program will move left/right after Repairing button
11. select - time the program will wait after selecting a bait
12. confirm - time the program will wait after 'Equip Bait' button
13. Additionally, if you want the program to display more information while fishing, change 'log_lvl' from INFO to DEBUG.

# Code installation guide
* Clone repo ```git clone https://github.com/Siterizer/new-world-fishing-bot.git```

510,510,dariusk/examplebot,JavaScript,"# ExampleBot

This bot retweets the latest tweet using the [""`#mediaarts`""][twitter-mediaarts] hashtag. It attempts to retweet once per hour.

_Note: you must be comfortable using your computer's command line interface to use this bot. If you've never used it, there are tutorials for [macOS](http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/introduction-to-the-mac-os-x-command-line) and [Windows](http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/windows-command-prompt-introduction/)._

## Installation

If you don't already have have them, please install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/). This will install two programs: `node`, which runs JavaScript from the command line, and `npm`, which helps you install software that Node.js can run.

Make an empty project directory somewhere convenient for you, [download the archive zip file](https://github.com/dariusk/examplebot/archive/master.zip), and unzip the contents to your project directory. Go to your project directory in the command line. There should be four files there: `.gitignore`, `README.md`, `bot.js` and `config.js`. In that directory type:

`npm install twit`

This installs some code to the `npm_modules` subdirectory, which you don't need to worry about. (It's Twit, the library that lets us talk to Twitter.)

## Connecting to Twitter

At this point you need to register a Twitter account and also get its ""app info"".

So create a Twitter account for whatever account you want to tweet this stuff. Twitter doesn't allow you to register multiple twitter accounts on the same email address. I recommend you create a brand new email address (perhaps using Gmail) for the Twitter account. Once you register the account to that email address, wait for the confirmation email. Then go here and log in as the Twitter account for your bot:

https://apps.twitter.com/app/new

Once you're there, fill in the required fields: name, description, website. None of it really matters at all to your actual app, it's just for Twitter's information. Do the captcha and submit.

Next you'll see a screen with a ""Details"" tab. Click on the ""Settings"" tab and under ""Application Type"" choose ""Read and Write"", then hit the update button at the bottom.

Then go to the Keys and Access Tokens tab, and at the bottom click ""create my access token"". Nothing might happen immediately. Wait a minute and reload the page. then there should be ""access token"" and ""access token secret"", which are both long strings of letters and numbers.

Now use a text editor to open up the ""config.js"" file. It should look like this:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  consumer_key:         'blah',
  consumer_secret:      'blah',
  access_token:         'blah',
  access_token_secret:  'blah'
}
```

In between those quotes, instead of `'blah'`, paste the appropriate info from the Details page. This is essentially the login information for the app.

Now type the following in the command line in your project directory:

`node bot.js`

Hopefully at this point you see a message like ""Success! Check your bot, it should have retweeted something."" Check the Twitter account for your bot, and it should have retweeted a tweet with the #mediaarts hashtag.

[twitter-mediaarts]:https://twitter.com/hashtag/mediaarts

## Setting up GroupMe, Discord, or Slack, and deploying app in Heroku

**Do not deploy 2 of the same bot in the same chat. In general, you should let your commissioner do the setup**

### GroupMe Setup
<details>
  <summary>Click to expand!</summary>

Go to www.groupme.com and sign up or login

If you don't have one for your league already, create a new ""Group Chat""

![](https://i.imgur.com/32ioDoZ.png)

Next we will setup the bot for GroupMe

Go to https://dev.groupme.com/session/new and login

Click ""Create Bot""

![](https://i.imgur.com/TI1bpwE.png)

Create your bot. GroupMe does a good job explaining what each thing is.

![](https://i.imgur.com/DQUcuuI.png)

After you have created your bot you will see something similar to this. Click ""Edit""

![](https://i.imgur.com/Z9vwKKt.png)

This page is important as you will need the ""Bot ID"" on this page.You can also send a test message with the text box to be sure it is connected to your chat room.
Side note: If you use the bot id depicted in the page you will spam an empty chat room so not worth the effort

![](https://i.imgur.com/U4MKZSY.png)
</details>

### Heroku setup

Heroku is what we will be using to host the chat bot (for free)

**You should not need to enter credit card information for this hosting service for our needs.**
You **may** run out of free hours without a credit card linked. If you decide to link your credit card you will have enough free hours for the month for a single application since this more than doubles your available hours. We are not responsible for any charges associated with Heroku.

Go to https://id.heroku.com/login and sign up or login

Go to your dashboard (https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps)
Now you will need to setup your environment variables so that it works for your league. Click Settings at your dashboard. Then click ""Reveal Config Vars"" button and you will see something like this.

![](https://i.imgur.com/7a1V6v8.png)

Now we will need to edit these variables (click the pencil to the right of the variable to modify)
Note: App will restart when you change any variable so your chat room may be semi-spammed with the init message of ""Hi"" you can change the INIT_MSG variable to be blank to have no init message. It should also be noted that Heroku seems to restart the app about once a day

- BOT_ID: This is your Bot ID from the GroupMe developers page (REQUIRED IF USING GROUPME)
- SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL: This is your Webhook URL from the Slack App page (REQUIRED IF USING SLACK)
- DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL: This is your Webhook URL from the Discord Settings page (REQUIRED IF USING DISCORD)
- LEAGUE_ID: This is your ESPN league id (REQUIRED)
- START_DATE: This is when the bot will start paying attention and sending messages to your chat. (2020-09-10 by default)
- END_DATE: This is when the bot will stop paying attention and stop sending messages to your chat. (2020-12-30 by default)
- LEAGUE_YEAR: ESPN League year to look at (2020 by default)
- TIMEZONE: The timezone that the messages will look to send in. (America/New_York by default)
- INIT_MSG: The message that the bot will say when it is started (can be blank or deleted for no message)
- TOP_HALF_SCORING: If set to True, when standings are posted on Wednesday it will also include being in the top half of your league for points and you receive an additional ""win"" for it.
- RANDOM_PHRASE: If set to True, when matchups are posted on Tuesday it will also include a random phrase
- MONITOR_REPORT: If set to True, will provide a report of players in starting lineup that are Questionable, Doubtful, Out, or projected for less than 4 points
- WAIVER_REPORT: If set to True, will provide a waiver report of add/drops. :warning: ESPN_S2 and SWID are required for this to work :warning:
- FAAB: If set to True, will provide Free-Agent Acquisition Budget (FAAB) dollars to  the waiver report
- DAILY_WAIVER: If set to True, will provide a waiver report of add/drops daily. :warning: ESPN_S2 and SWID are required for this to work :warning:
- ESPN_S2: Used for private leagues. See [Private Leagues Section](#private-leagues) for documentation
- SWID: Used for private leagues. (Can be defined with or without {}) See [Private Leagues Section](#private-leagues) for documentation


After you have setup your variables you will need to turn it on. Navigate to the ""Resources"" tab of your Heroku app Dashboard.
You should see something like below. Click the pencil on the right and toggle the buton so it is blue like depicted and click ""Confirm.""
![](https://i.imgur.com/J6bpV2I.png)

You're done! You now have a fully featured GroupMe/Slack/Discord chat bot for ESPN leagues! If you have an INIT_MSG you will see it exclaimed in your GroupMe, Discord, or Slack chat room.

Unfortunately to do auto deploys of the latest version you need admin access to the repository on git. You can check for updates on the github page (https://github.com/dtcarls/ff_bot/commits/master) and click the deploy button again; however, this will deploy a new instance and the variables will need to be edited again.

#### Private Leagues

For private league you will need to get your swid and espn_s2.
You can find these two values after logging into your espn fantasy football account on espn's website.
(Chrome Browser)
Right click anywhere on the website and click inspect option.
From there click Application on the top bar.
On the left under Storage section click Cookies then http://fantasy.espn.com.
From there you should be able to find your swid and espn_s2 variables and values.

## Troubleshooting / FAQ

**League must be full.**

The bot isn't working
Did you miss a step in the instructions? Try doing it from scratch again. If still no luck, open an issue (https://github.com/dtcarls/fantasy_football_chat_bot/issues) or hop into the discord (link at the top of readme) so the answer can be shared with others.

How are power ranks calculated?
They are calculated using 2 step dominance, as well as a combination of points scored and margin of victory. Weighted 80/15/5 respectively. I wouldn't so much pay attention to the actual number but more of the gap between teams. Full source of the calculations can be seen here: https://github.com/cwendt94/espn-api/pull/12/files. If you want a tutorial on dominance matrices: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=784TmwaHPOw

Is there a version of this for Yahoo/CBS/NFL/[insert other site]?
No, this would require a significant rework for other sites.

I'm not getting the init message
Are you sure you flipped the switch in Heroku to activate the worker (the toggle should be blue)? The other common mistake is misconfigured environment variables.

I keep getting the init message.
Remove your init message and it will stop. The init message is really for first setup to ensure it is working.

How do I set another timezone?
Specify your variable https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones#List

Is there a version of this for Messenger/WhatsApp/[insert other chat]?
No, but I am open to pull requests implementing their API for additional cross platform support.

My Standings look wrong. I have weird (+1) in it.
TOP_HALF_SCORING: If set to True, when standings are posted on Wednesday it will also include top half scoring wins
Top half wins is being in the top half of your league for points and you receive an additional ""win"" for it. The number in parenthesis (+1) tells you how many added wins over the season for top half wins.

517,517,ChameleonBot/Bot,Swift,"# Chameleon
Chameleon is a Slack bot built with Swift.

![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/Version-0.1.0-brightgreen.svg) 
![Swift](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/0727f3687a1e263cac101c5387df41048641339c/68747470733a2f2f696d672e736869656c64732e696f2f62616467652f53776966742d332e302d6f72616e67652e7376673f7374796c653d666c6174)
![Platforms](https://img.shields.io/badge/Platforms-osx%20%7C%20linux-lightgrey.svg)

## What is Chameleon?
It consists of several frameworks, the core of which are:

* **Models**: Exposes Slack model data. Slack's APIs only provide object ids in their responses, however the model layer is able to convert those into _full_ model objects. 
* **WebAPI**: Allows interaction with Slack's Web API.
* **RTMAPI**: Allows interaction with Slack's Real-time messaging API.
* **Bot**: Utilises each of the frameworks to provide an extensible Slack bot user.
* **Sugar**: Provides a layer over all frameworks adding various helpers, wrappers and syntactic sugar to make developing features more declarative.

## Features
* [x] **Extensible**: `SlackService`'s can be added to provide any behaviour you need.
* [x] **Typed**: You always get to work with _full_ typed Slack model data.

# Installation
Refer to the [Installation Guide](https://github.com/ChameleonBot/Bot/blob/master/INSTALLATION.md).

# APIs
Refer to the [API Guide](https://github.com/ChameleonBot/Bot/blob/master/API.md).

# Contributing
Want to contribute, check out the [Contribution Guide](https://github.com/ChameleonBot/Bot/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

# ⚠️ Work in Progress
This is a work in progress so expect improvements as well as breaking changes!

Chameleon is *functional* however there is still a lot to do before it is *complete*

* The Web and Real time messaging APIs can do _a lot_ - 
I have built support for the core/most common features but they are incomplete. 
I will add more over time until they are complete.

# Acknowledgement
This was my first dive into 'Server Side Swift'; 
95% of this code was done over a total of a few days but getting working in the terminal 
and then deployed to Heroku took far longer... This project would likely have ended up as 
mostly useless OSX app if it hadn't been for the teams from [Vapor](http://qutheory.io/) and [Zewo](http://www.zewo.io/)
pioneering the server side Swift movement. I am especially thankful for the help and patience of

518,518,0xEssential/opensea-discord-bot,TypeScript,"# Discord Bot for OpenSea

Need help? [Join us on Discord](https://discord.gg/BheNSUfcvm)!

Non-developers should also consider using [Boto for their Discord sales bot needs](https://medium.com/boto-corp/opensea-nfts-to-discord-bot-no-code-eeec8340112d?source=friends_link&sk=df690bf11c6c5efa91a98a31a23e36f9). 

This project includes a script that can be used to routinely hit the OpenSea API, check for recent sales on a collection, and post embeds into a Discord channel with information about the sale.

Please don't abuse the OpenSea API by running this more frequently than once per hour. Ideally you should request an API key from OpenSea, and in a perfect world you would instead use Webhooks from OpenSea.

## Prerequisites

This script can easily be deployed to Heroku and run on a job schedule, so you'll need a free Heroku account from https://heroku.com. The script can be run locally or from any server that offers a NodeJS runtime.

You'll also need a Discord bot who has the ability to post in a channel in your Discord server.

First, you need a Discord server where you have permission to add a Bot. It's free and easy to create your own Discord server.

Once you have a server you can use, grab the channel ID following the instructions at this Discord support article. You'll enable developer mode, which will allow you to easily copy the channel ID from the Discord app - https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/206346498-Where-can-I-find-my-User-Server-Message-ID-.

Next, create a New Application on the Discord developer portal by clicking the button in the top right corner at https://discord.com/developers/applications.

Give your application a name.

Click into the Bot menu item. You can name your bot and give it an avatar, but the only requirement is that you copy the Bot token:

![Discord bot token screenshot](./.github/bot-token.png)

Click into the OAuth2 menu item. Give your application the bot scope:

![Discord scopes screenshot](./.github/discord-scope.png)

Then, in the next section, give your bot the Send Messages permission under Text Permissions:

![Discord bot permissions screenshot](./.github/discord-bot-permissions.png)

Now you're ready to authenticate your bot to your server - copy the OAuth URL from the scopes box and open it in your browser. You'll be asked to give permission to the bot to enter your server.

Once the bot is in your server, ensure you have the following two values and you are ready to deploy or run your script:

- **botToken** i.e `SBI1MDI0NzUyNDQ3NzgyOTEz.YF36LQ.Sw-rczOfalK0lVzuW8vBjjcnsy0`
- **channelId** i.e. `814900494928445450`

## Run locally

You can run this script locally by pulling the repo to your local machine.

First, install the dependencies with `npm` or `yarn`.

Then copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and replace the example values with your own. Or set them in your environment manually.

The contract address for the NFT collection:
```
CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0x196c4C7291D47BCDBbf37ab7ec9AE7ECB21Aef52
```

The collection slug as found in the OS URL `https://opensea.io/collection/picassopunks`:
```
COLLECTION_SLUG=picassopunks
```

The Id of the discord channel to post sales to:
```
DISCORD_CHANNEL_ID=123456789101112130
```

You can also send to multiple channels by adding multiple IDs:
```
DISCORD_CHANNEL_ID=123456789101112130;123456789101738273;123456783649182736
```

The token from the discord bot you created above:
```
DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=SBI1MDI0NzUyNDQ3NzgyOTEz.YF36LQ.Sw-rczOfalK0lVzuW8vBjjcnsy0
```

Your OpenSEA API token:
```
OPENSEA_TOKEN=some-key-here
```

 If you don't have one yet, [request for an API token](https://docs.opensea.io/reference/request-an-api-key).

Then just run the code!
```
$ yarn ts-node ./checkSales.ts
// or
$ ts-node ./checkSales.ts
```

## Deploy to Heroku

The easiest way to run this script on a chron scheduler is to deploy it to Heroku with this button:

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy)

Heroku will require that you input the ENV vars that are necessary to run the script, and will run the `checkSales.ts` script after a successful deploy.

The `scheduler` add-on is included in the `app.json` but **you still must schedule the script to run** and we recommend running it hourly. This way the script will run every hour and will check the OpenSea API for sales in the last hour.

To set up the script to run on a schedule, once your Heroku app finishes deploying, click ""Manage App"", and then navigate to the Heroku Scheduler addon. Create a new job, run it every, and enter 

```bash
yarn ts-node checkSales.ts
```

as the Run Command.

521,521,norecha/pokubot,Java,"##PokuBot
An open source Clash of Clans bot. Read [FAQ](#faq) for most common issues.

###Features
* Auto train troops(all troops)
* Auto opponent finder matching gold, elixir, dark elixir criterias
* Auto attack with different attack strategies
* Attack with Barb King/Archer Queen and use the ability.
* Or you can just use it to find opponents, be notified when there is a match, and attack manually.
* Detect empty collectors
* Disconnect detector. You cannot run game for more than 6 hours at a time, you will be disconnected after that for 5 min, it will reload you again. Or in case something goes wrong and bot dies, you will get disconnected from inactivity, and it will log you back in and start again.
* Background mode

###Requirements
* Windows OS
* [BlueStacks] (http://www.bluestacks.com/) [(Tutorial here)](http://cocland.com/tutorials/play-clash-clans-pc-bluestacks)
* [Java 8 JRE] (http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html)
* Bot uses down arrow key to zoom up, make sure that key zooms up for you as well.
* Do not click CTRL key when bot is running, if you make a ctrl and mouse click, you will see BlueStacks is zooming(If not you are lucky, mine does). It will interfere with bot's clicks.
* Make sure your display&pc never goes to sleep.(power settings)
* You need to have at least level 4 barracks(it should have boost and boost all options because bot will click train button according to that. It will not boost it for you automatically.)
* Run the game in **English,** some users reported errors in other languages.

###Instructions
Download the latest version of PokuBot from [releases page](https://github.com/norecha/pokubot/releases) and run the .jar file.

Make sure you are running it with java 8, not with an older version of Java.
Right click to .jar file, Properties -> Open with -> Change -> Browse.
Then choose javaw.exe in your jre8 or jdk8 installation path, ex: C:\Program Files\Java\jre1.8.0_25\bin\javaw.exe

BlueStacks must run in 860x720 resolution, it will automatically set that up, but in case it fails, you have to do it manually.

After PokuBot is opened, click start to go through setup, write down your settings and hit save.
You can change the values while bot is running too, just don't forget to click save.

All settings are saved under %appdata%/PokuBot/config.properties.
In case barracks configuration went wrong and you want to reset it, you can delete this file.

###Recommended Settings
* At least 170k for resources, so you increase the chance of getting a base with full collectors.
* Auto Attack: Attack 4 Side Parallel 2 Half Wave
* Detect empty collectors: true
* Rax 1: Barb
* Rax 2: Barb
* Rax 3: Archer
* Rax 4: Archer

*If one or more of your barracks are upgrading, you need to set remaining ones to ""No Unit""

###Issues
If there are bugs/suggestions, create an issue and attach the log file.

###FAQ
* Stuck in StateIdle

    Your resolution is not right. If bot fails to automatically change it, you need to manually change values from registry. Google how to change resolution for bluestacks. You need to **restart** your BlueStacks(from system tray icon) after you change resolution. If it still looks wrong, restart your pc.

* Not attacking, bot dies after first opponent.

    Change your in-game language to English.

* Barracks are scrolling to dark barracks/spells instead of next barracks

    Your first barracks was improperly configured. All settings are saved under %appdata%/PokuBot/config.properties. Delete this file and reconfigure.

(We have more builds like linux arm/arm64 and .NET framework dependent builds available on our [nightly server](https://splamy.de/Nightly#ts3ab))

#### Linux
Install the required dependencies:
* on **Ubuntu**/**Debian**:  
Run `sudo apt-get install libopus-dev ffmpeg`
* on **Arch Linux**:  
Run `sudo pacman -S opus ffmpeg`
* on **CentOS 7**:  
Run
    ```
    sudo yum -y install epel-release
    sudo rpm -Uvh http://li.nux.ro/download/nux/dextop/el7/x86_64/nux-dextop-release-0-5.el7.nux.noarch.rpm
    sudo yum -y install ffmpeg opus-devel
	```
* **manually**:
    1. Make sure you have a C compiler installed
    1. Make the Opus script runnable with `chmod u+x InstallOpus.sh` and run it with `./InstallOpus.sh`
    1. Get the ffmpeg [32bit](https://johnvansickle.com/ffmpeg/builds/ffmpeg-git-i686-static.tar.xz) or [64bit](https://johnvansickle.com/ffmpeg/builds/ffmpeg-git-amd64-static.tar.xz) binary.
    1. Extract the ffmpeg archive with `tar -vxf ffmpeg-git-*XXbit*-static.tar.xz`
    1. Get the ffmpeg binary from `ffmpeg-git-*DATE*-amd64-static/ffmpeg` and copy it into your TS3AudioBot folder.

#### Windows
1. Get the ffmpeg [32bit](https://ffmpeg.zeranoe.com/builds/win32/static/ffmpeg-latest-win32-static.zip) or [64bit](https://ffmpeg.zeranoe.com/builds/win64/static/ffmpeg-latest-win64-static.zip) binary.
1. Open the archive and copy the ffmpeg binary from `ffmpeg-latest-winXX-static/bin/ffmpeg.exe` into your TS3AudioBot folder.

### Optional Dependencies
If the bot can't play some youtube videos it might be due to some embedding restrictions which are blocking this.  
You can install the [youtube-dl](https://github.com/rg3/youtube-dl/) binary or source folder (and specify the path in the config) to try to bypass this.

### First time setup
1. Run the bot with `./TS3AudioBot` (Linux) or `TS3AudioBot.exe` (Windows) and follow the setup instructions.
1. (Optional) Close the bot and configure your `rights.toml` to your desires.
You can use the template rules as suggested in the automatically generated file,
or dive into the rights syntax [here](https://github.com/Splamy/TS3AudioBot/wiki/Rights).
Then start the bot again.
1. (Optional, but highly recommended for everything to work properly).
   - Create a privilege key for the ServerAdmin group (or a group which has equivalent rights).
   - Send the bot in a private message `!bot setup <privilege key>`.

### Entspahnt in den Sommer ☀

Automatisierte Impftermin-Vermittlung des offiziellen [ImpfterminService - Der Patientenservice 116117](https://www.impfterminservice.de). 
Der Bot kann mehrere Standorte parallel durchsuchen und auf verfügbare Terminen überwachen. Dabei wird der gesamte 
Prozess von der Vermittlungscode-Beschaffung bis zur Reservierung und Benachrichtigung freier Termine ganzheitlich 
abgebildet.

Wenn ein freier Impftermin / Slot gefunden wird, sendet der Bot eine Benachrichtigung via Zulip, Telegram oder Pushover 
(Slack, Webhooks, ... sind einfach integrierbar) und macht den Benutzer via Sprachausgabe auf den Slot aufmerksam. 
So kann der SMS Bestätigungscode manuell oder von überall unterwegs via Lieblings-Chat App übermittelt werden - 
Impf Bot.py erledigt den Rest. - [detaillierter Workflow](#Workflow)

Der Bot verwendet Browser-Automatisierung, die im Hintergrund laufen kann und es dem Benutzer ermöglicht manuell 
einzugreifen sowie einfach nachzuvollziehen, was gerade passiert. Die wichtigen Timings können dabei eingestellt
werden, um einen Timeout (bzw. *Shadow Ban*) zu vermeiden.

This is an improved Python implementation of the Java-based [💉🤖 Impf-Bot](https://github.com/TobseF/impf-bot) which
did a lot of the heavy lifting.

## ⭐ Features
 ⭐ Easy to set up  
 ⭐ Book appointments remotely  
 ⭐ Python for the 21st Century  
 ⭐ Full browser automation   
 ⭐ Concurrent checking  
 ⭐ Waiting room detection  
 ⭐ Instant Vermittlungscode Creation  
 ⭐ Timeout / Shadow Ban `429` detection  
 ⭐ Automatically re-check *Vermittlungscode*  
 ⭐ `settings.py` for single point of configuration  
 ⭐ Manual user intervention & smart error resilience  
 ⭐ Zulip, Pushover, Telegram integration  
 ⭐ Run custom Commands for Alerting (Text-to-Speech preconfigured)  
 ⭐ Easy to add additional backends, like Slack, Webhooks ...  
 ⭐ Docker Support  

## Workflow

This is a two-step process. First you'll need a *Vermittlungscode* to then book a vaccination appointment. Each center<sup>*</sup>
has its own valid *Vermittlungscode*, which you'll need to acquire first to advance to the next step.

1. If you do not have a *Vermittlungscode* for a center yet - you can either follow the standard
   workflow described below or create one instantly (see [Run it](#Run-it-))
    * The bot will check the site to see if there is vacancy
    * If there is vacancy, the bot will enter your age, email and phone number
    * The bot will alert you that there is vacancy using the alert backends
    * ImpfterminService will send you a SMS with a confirmation code
    * Either enter the code manually or send it to the bot using `sms:123-456`
    * The *Vermittlungscode* is sent to your email
    * Enter the *Vermittlungscode* on the center in `settings.py` and restart the bot 🚨
2. If you have a *Vermittlungscode* for a center
    * The bot will enter your *Vermittlungscode*
    * It will check if there are available appointments
    * If there are appointments, it will alert you using your alert backend
    * You can choose an appointment using your favorite chat app `appt:1` or book the appointment manually
    * To book an appointment manually when you're not on your PC, use a remote access tool (I prefer `AnyDesk`, but 
      `TeamViewer` also works) to access your machine remotely

<sup>* Every center is hosted on a server, indicated by the numbers in the URL, e.g. 
https://001-iz.impfterminservice.de/impftermine/service?plz=70713 is server **001**.
Vermittlungscodes are valid for *every* center on the given server 
[ref](https://www.impfterminservice.de/assets/static/impfzentren.json)</sup>  


> ### ⚠ Warning: The online booking isn't an authorization
> On the booking date you still have to bring the documents with you, to proof that you are qualified to receive the vaccination.
> Check out [the official guidelines](https://sozialministerium.baden-wuerttemberg.de/de/gesundheit-pflege/gesundheitsschutz/infektionsschutz-hygiene/informationen-zu-coronavirus/impfberechtigt-bw/)
> and make sure you are qualified for them. This bot doesn't help you get a privilege. It only allows you to get a date without losing the nerves or waisting a lifetime in pointless callcenter calls.

## Setup 👾

### Requirements

* [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* [Selenium](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads) for Chrome
* Google Chrome
* `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

### For Dummies

> I don't know anything about programming! And CLI gives me anxiety

Don't worry. It's easy. Follow [this](/docs/INSTALL.md) Step-by-Step Guide and then come back.

### For Techies

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alfonsrv/impf-botpy.git
cd impf-botpy
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
# configure settings.py
mv settings.sample.py settings.py
python3 main.py
```

### Configuration

1. Rename `settings.sample.py` to `settings.py` and open it with your favorite text editor (recommended: Sublime Text)
2. Edit the `LOCATIONS` by adding your Impfzentrum with the name as shown on [ImpfterminService](https://impfterminservice.de/)
3. If you already have a *Vermittlungscode* for one of the centers, enter it at `code` - otherwise leave empty
4. Enter your age, mail and phone number
5. The rest of the settings is ok as is. If you want to check locations with multiple browsers at the same time, dig 
into the `Advanced Features` section.

### Alerting

Audio alerting is already preconfigured. If you also want to use smartphone notifications in order to interact with 
the bot remotely, follow [this](/docs/ALERTS.md) setup guide.

### Run it ⚡ 

* `python3 main.py` und entspahnen
* `python3 main.py --alerts` to test configured alerts
* `python3 main.py --code` to instantly create a *Vermittlungscode* (works best from 23:00 to 07:00)

### Docker

Please refer to the [Docker Setup](/docs/DOCKER.md) to run on a headless server.

## Support & Contributing 🪢

### Feature Requests & Feedback

Stuck? Too complex? File an [issue](https://github.com/alfonsrv/impf-botpy/issues/new/choose)!

Successfully booked an appointment?  
Feedback and feature requests are always much appreciated and can be submitted 
[here](https://github.com/alfonsrv/impf-botpy/issues/1)!

### Web Designers

If you're a web designer and want to create a [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) for this project, you're 
more than welcome!

### Adding Backends for Alerts

Contributions are welcome! Adding your favorite backend (e.g. Slack) for alerting is easy. 
Simply add your preferred integration to

1. `alert.py` and integrate it with `read_backend()` and `send_alert()`
2. `constructor.py` if your API is a bit more complex to keep things tidy
3. `settings.py` add your relevant settings (must include `ENABLED` flag)
4. `main.py` in `print_config` for NextGen UX
5. Optional: Setup Guide in [ALERTS.md](/docs/ALERTS.md)
6. Pull Request & Done 💥

### Unit Tests

Good with pyTest? Help this project creating some proper test coverage! Unfortunately I'm pretty unexperienced with 
mocking requests and what good tests should look like. Even just a few are enough, so I can get the hang of it.

### Stay Up-to-Date

⚠ **Please note:** Even though this bot is geared towards being as solid as possible, you should consider regularly 
checking this repository (site) to ensure you have the latest version. Unfortunately this is a bit of an arms 
race as the website is under constant modification. Checking the version at the top of the page and comparing it with 
`python main.py --version` is usually quite a good way to see if you're up-to-date. Alternatively you can get 
`Notifications` on top of the page to know whenever the code changes.  
When updating especially ensure your `settings.py` has all the options!

Auch ich wünschte, dass es so n Tool nicht geben müsste, aber ist aktuell einfach absolute Katastrophe. Seid vernünftig 
und missbraucht den Bot nicht, ja?

輸入完之後，可以按 VERIFY ，如果你的 CODE 正確無誤，就會顯示 Success

![alt tag](http://i.imgur.com/Mey5FKF.jpg)

不過我使用 [line-bot-sdk-python](https://github.com/line/line-bot-sdk-python)當我按下 VERIFY，卻出現錯誤，不過是可以正常運作，所以暫時先不管他。

關於上述這個問題，可以到 [issues 2](https://github.com/twtrubiks/line-bot-tutorial/issues/2)
以及 [issues 3](https://github.com/twtrubiks/line-bot-tutorial/issues/3) 觀看說明。( 感謝熱心的網友 )

基本上到這裡就是完成了，趕快去加入自己的 line bot 玩玩看吧~

只要我有新的想法，我會同步更新在這篇文章， line bot 還有很多好玩的地方

## 使用 imgur 官方 api

透過 imgur 官方 api  [imgurpython](https://github.com/Imgur/imgurpython) ,

從自己的相簿隨機回傳一張正妹照片，

請到下方獲取自己的 CLIENT_ID ,  CLIENT_SECRET  , 以及自己相簿的 album_id

![alt tag](http://i.imgur.com/nQNQVD7.jpg)

並將自己的資料輸入在下方程式碼

```python
client_id = 'YOUR_IMGUR_CLIENT_ID'
client_secret = 'YOUR_IMGUR__CLIENT_SECRET'
album_id = 'YOUR_IMGUR_ALBUM_ID'
```

更多詳細的介紹可參考 [imgurpython](https://github.com/Imgur/imgurpython)

## 其他補充

只要有使用到網址，請記得一定都要用 **https**

舉例

```pyhton
image_message = ImageSendMessage(
            original_content_url=""https://example.com.img1.jpg"",
            preview_image_url=""https://example.com.img1.jpg""
        )
```

## 設定選單

有一些東西是必須到 line 的官網去設定的，像是下方的選單

![alt tag](http://i.imgur.com/IB3hBl8.jpg)

請到 [https://admin-official.line.me/](https://admin-official.line.me/) 選擇自己的 bot ，然後開始設定，

建立圖片影音內容 -> 圖文訊息選單 ( 如下圖 )

![alt tag](http://i.imgur.com/igKd6Og.png)

顯示設定，請選擇 ***反映***，不然會沒有效果

![alt tag](http://i.imgur.com/pEHSxUH.png)

接著選擇樣式，

記得，***選單內容設定*** 全部都要設定，不然會沒有效果

![alt tag](http://i.imgur.com/u0bzYu7.png)

最後，那個主要兩個字非常礙眼 ( 如下圖 )

![alt tag](http://i.imgur.com/Lv3BMyz.jpg)

我們可以從這裡把它關掉

帳號設定 -> 基本設定

![alt tag](http://i.imgur.com/bwjWijG.png)

將 行動官網選單 設定為 隱藏 即可

## Heroku 注意事項

有些人可能會遇到佈署失敗的問題，可以試著將 [runtime.txt](https://github.com/twtrubiks/line-bot-tutorial/blob/master/runtime.txt) 修改為 3.6.6。

( 這個只要依照提示更新就行了 )

如果遇到 Upgrading to the Latest Stack，只需要到 Heroku 上修正後，重新佈署即可，可參考

[Upgrading to the Latest Stack](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/upgrading-to-the-latest-stack) 以及 [Stacks](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/stack)。

因為 gunicorn 的更新，現在需要將 [Procfile](https://github.com/twtrubiks/line-bot-tutorial/blob/master/Procfile) 多加上 `--preload`，也就是變成

```Procfile
web gunicorn app:app --preload
```

詳細可參考
[Advanced configuration](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/python-gunicorn#advanced-configuration)。

## 執行環境

* Python 3.6.6

## Reference

* [line messaging-api](https://devdocs.line.me/en/#messaging-api)
* [line-bot-sdk-python](https://github.com/line/line-bot-sdk-python)

react-native wrapper for android [BottomSheetBehavior](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/design/widget/BottomSheetBehavior.html), supports [FloatingActionButton](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/design/widget/FloatingActionButton.html).

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/react-native-bottom-sheet-behavior.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/react-native-bottom-sheet-behavior)

## Demo

![react-native-bottom-sheet-behavior](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5366959/24594266/c59667bc-1801-11e7-840c-97588658a8ae.gif)

[See the Google Maps gif implementation](https://github.com/cesardeazevedo/react-native-bottom-sheet-behavior/blob/master/example/views/GoogleMapsView.js)

## v1.0.0

This major release v1.0.0 supports anchor state, which means that you can have a middle state between collapsed and expanded.

This version now uses a custom BottomSheetBehavior implementation from
[miguelhincapie/CustomBottomSheetBehavior](https://github.com/miguelhincapie/CustomBottomSheetBehavior)
which is basically a fork from the original design-support, but with anchor state support and colors management,
even though is custom implementation, old version should work as before, and you can also disable the
anchor state with `anchorEnabled` prop which is disabled by default.

## Components

The following components are included in this package:

* CoordinatorLayout
* BottomSheetBehavior
* FloatingActionButton
* MergedAppBarLayout
* ScrollingAppBarLayout
* BackdropBottomSheet
* BottomSheetHeader

**NOTE** We expose some android core components such as `CoordinatorLayout`, `AppBarLayout`, `FloatingActionButton`,
but they are NOT meant to be general purposed, and it may not work out of the context of this library,
so use at your own risk.

### iOS Alternative

If you are wondering some iOS alternative, i highly recommend [react-native-interactable](https://github.com/wix/react-native-interactable) by [wix](https://github.com/wix),
you can see their google maps approach [here](https://github.com/wix/react-native-interactable/blob/master/playground/src/real-life-examples/MapPanel.js),
which is very easy to get started.

## Install

`$ npm install react-native-bottom-sheet-behavior`

### Install with RNPM

`$ react-native link react-native-bottom-sheet-behavior`

### Install Manually

Edit the current files as follows.

android/settings.gradle

```diff

include ':app'

+   include ':react-native-bottom-sheet-behavior'
+   project(':react-native-bottom-sheet-behavior').projectDir = new File(rootProject.projectDir, '../node_modules/react-native-bottom-sheet-behavior/android')

```

android/app/build.gradle


```diff

    dependencies {
        implementation fileTree(dir: ""libs"", include: [""*.jar""])
        implementation ""com.android.support:appcompat-v7:${rootProject.ext.supportLibVersion}""
+       implementation ""com.android.support:design:${rootProject.ext.supportLibVersion}""
        implementation ""com.facebook.react:react-native:+""  // From node_modules
+       implementation project(':react-native-bottom-sheet-behavior')
    }

```


MainApplication.java

```diff

+   import com.bottomsheetbehavior.BottomSheetBehaviorPackage;

    public class MainApplication extends Application implements ReactApplication {

      @Override
      protected List<ReactPackage> getPackages() {
        return Arrays.<ReactPackage>asList(
            new MainReactPackage(),
+           new BottomSheetBehaviorPackage()
        );
      }
    }

```

## Usage

You will need to wrap your view into a `CoordinatorLayout` to make it work.

```jsx

    render() {
      return (
          <CoordinatorLayout style={{flex: 1}}>
            <View style={{ flex: 1, backgroundColor: 'transparent' }}></View>
            <BottomSheetBehavior
              ref='bottomSheet'
              peekHeight={70}
              hideable={false}
              state={BottomSheetBehavior.STATE_COLLAPSED}>
              <View style={{backgroundColor: '#4389f2'}}>
                <View style={{padding: 26}}>
                  <Text>BottomSheetBehavior!</Text>
                </View>
                <View style={{height: 200, backgroundColor: '#fff'}} />
              </View>
            </BottomSheetBehavior>
            <FloatingActionButton autoAnchor ref=""fab"" />
          </CoordinatorLayout>
      )
    }

```

> *NOTE*
> Make sure that your view has a `backgroundColor` style to prevent some ""bugs"" when rendering the container.

### Components Order

You should follow this component order.

```jsx

render() {
  return (
    <CoordinatorLayout>
      <ScrollingAppBarLayout>
        <ToolbarAndroid />
      </ScrollingAppBarLayout>
      <View>Main Content</View>
      <BackdropBottomSheet />
      <BottomSheetBehavior />
      <MergedAppBarLayout
        <ToolbarAndroid />
      </MergedAppBarLayout>
      <FloatingActionButton />
    </CoordinatorLayout>
  )
}

```

### Events

In order to get the current bottom sheet state or offset, you can listen to `onStateChange` or `onSlide` respectively.

```jsx
  <BottomSheetBehavior
    onSlide={(e) => console.log(e.nativeEvent.offset)}
    onStateChange={(e) => console.log(e.nativeEvent.state)}
  />
```

## AppBarLayouts

We provide some custom AppBars that has custom behaviors, they automatically connects with BottomSheetBehavior
in order to connects with `ToolbarAndroid` and toggle visibility, both AppBars can also manager StatusBar backgrounds.

Currently, AppBars only supports `ToolbarAndroid` as a child, you may have some troubles trying to render a custom View.

#### ScrollingAppBarLayout

This behavior hides and sets the StatusBar background to transparent when you starting dragging the BottomSheet,
and reappears when the BottomSheet backs to the collapsed state, setting back the StatusBar background color
with `statusBarColor` prop.

![scrollingappbar](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5366959/24859715/2360e3f6-1dc8-11e7-9bb4-090d7dfb25f4.gif)

#### MergedAppBarLayout

The MergedAppBarLayout behavior appears when the BottomSheet reaches the anchor state (or expanded state if you're not using anchorEnabled).
When the BottomSheet is getting over the MergedAppBar, it will partially sets the height of ToolbarAndroid revealing the
`mergedColor` prop, and when the BottomSheet is fully expanded, it sets the ToolbarAndroid with the `toolbarColor` prop.

```jsx
<MergedAppBarLayout
  translucent={true}
  barStyle='light-content'
  barStyleTransparent='dark-content'
  mergedColor='#1abc9c'
  toolbarColor='#34495e'
  statusBarColor='#2c3e50'>
  <ToolbarAndroid
    navIconName=""md-arrow-back""
    overflowIconName='md-more'
    title='React Native Bar!'
    titleColor='#fff'
  />
</MergedAppBarLayout>
```

![mergedappbar](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5366959/24858662/9dad8eac-1dc3-11e7-92c9-c36ce673d6f8.gif)

![merged_color](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5366959/24860941/41381750-1dcd-11e7-8128-a6dd422e9a19.jpg)

### Translucent App Bars

Both AppBars supports translucent status bar, you can enable with `translucent` prop, which will basically adds top margins and **NOT** change the translucent itself, you should handle the translucent directely on the react-native StatusBar component.

## FloatingActionButton

If you are using FloatingActionButton, the `autoAnchor` prop will automatically connect to BottomSheetBehavior,
in order to follow when it's dragging.

```jsx
<FloatingActionButton autoAnchor />
```

You still can do it manually though, by doing this.

```js
  componentDidMount() {
    this.refs.fab.setAnchorId(this.refs.bottomSheet)
  }
```

FloatingActionButton's has a custom behavior that hides when closely reaches MergedAppBarLayout.

### Support for react-native-vector-icons

You can also use [react-native-vector-icons](https://github.com/oblador/react-native-vector-icons)
on FloatingActionButton, which will automatically load the icon for you.

```jsx
  import Icon from 'react-native-vector-icons/Ionicons'

  ...

  render() {
    return (
      <FloatingActionButton icon={""directions""} iconProvider={Icon} />
    )
  }
```

You can check [GoogleMapsView.js](https://github.com/cesardeazevedo/react-native-bottom-sheet-behavior/blob/master/example/views/GoogleMapsView.js) example.

## BackdropBottomSheet

This component is rendered behind the BottomSheetBehavior, and behave like a parallax when BottomSheet is dragging.
you should pass a fixed `height` prop that may match with `anchorPoint` prop from BottomSheet, in order to achieve a full screen view
when reaches the anchor state.

## BottomSheetHeader

This component abstracts color management between BottomSheet states on the native side,
it will find all <Text /> and <Icon /> components recursively and handles everything out the box.

## NestedScrollView

If you are not using the anchor point, and want to add some nested scroll, you will need to install the [react-native-nested-scroll-view](https://github.com/cesardeazevedo/react-native-nested-scroll-view)
to allows you to scroll inside bottom sheet continuously.

**Note** the `react-native-nested-scroll-view` is only useful when you are **NOT** using the anchorPoint.

###### The AI that beats you at Melee

### FAQ

1. **What character does SmashBot play?**

    Fox, of course!

2. **Does SmashBot work with Slippi?**

    It does! To run SmashBot, you can just use your regular Slippi Dolphin install.

3. **Can I Run SmashBot online?**

    No and don't try. It won't work for you and it will just mess up a lot, making both you and SmashBot look bad. You can play it locally in VS mode.

4. **Does SmashBot cheat?**

    The short answer is: No.

    The long answer is that SmashBot only interfaces with the game by pressing buttons on a virtual controller. There isn't anything it does that you **couldn't** do in principle. It just so happens, however, that a computer is much faster and more reliable than you, so it's able to do things that a human realistically can't.

5. **How is SmashBot designed?**

    SmashBot makes decisions on a tiered hierarchy of objectives: Strategies, Tactics, and Chains. Each objective inspects the current game state and decides which lower level objective will be best to achieve it.

    **Strategies** are the highest level means that the AI will use to accomplish the overall goal. For instance, the SmashBot will typically take the strategy of baiting the opponent into a poor move.

    **Tactics** are lowish level series of predictable circumstances that we can realistically flowchart our way through. For instance, if the enemy is off the stage we may choose to edge guard them to keep them from getting back on.

    **Chains** are the lowest level of objective that consists of a ""chain"" of button presses that Smashers will recognize, such as Wavedash, Jump-canceled Upsmash, etc...

6. **Can I play SmashBot on a regular GameCube or hacked Wii?**

    For right now, SmashBot only runs on a PC as a normal computer program. (Meaning that Melee has to be in an emulator)

7. **What Operating Systems does it play on?**

    SmashBot runs on Linux, OSX, and Windows!

8. **I found a bug. How can I help?**

    Hey thanks, that's awesome! For starters, make sure you can reliably reproduce the bug. Then go ahead and make an Issue on GitHub at https://github.com/altf4/SmashBot/issues. If you want to be even MORE awesome, run the AI with the ""--debug"" flag and upload the CSV file it gives you along with the issue. That CSV contains a full breakdown of the AI's state at each frame, so we can easily pinpoint what went wrong and where.


## Setup Steps:

1. Install libmelee, a Python 3 API for interacting with Dolphin and Melee. `pip3 install melee`
Also make sure to stay updated on libmelee with `pip3 install --upgrade melee`

2. Install and configure Slippi, just like you would for rollback netplay. Full instructions here: https://slippi.gg

3. You'll probably want a GameCube Adapter, available on Amazon here: https://www.amazon.com/Super-Smash-GameCube-Adapter-Wii-U/dp/B00L3LQ1FI. Or alternatively the HitBox adapter works well too: https://www.hitboxarcade.com/products/gamecube-controller-adapter

4. Install some custom Slippi Gecko Codes. You can find them here: https://github.com/altf4/slippi-ssbm-asm/blob/libmelee/Output/Netplay/GALE01r2.ini Simply replace your existing `GALE01r2.ini` file with this one.

5. Make sure you have all the `Required` and `Recommended` Gecko Codes enabled.

6. Disable the `Apply Delay to all In-Game Screens` Gecko Code.

7. Run `smashbot.py -e PATH_TO_SLIPPI_FOLDER` (Not the actual exe itself, just the directory where it is)

8. By default, SmashBot takes controller 2, and assumes you're on controller 1. You can change this with the `--port N`  option to change SmashBot's port, and `--opponent N` to change the human player's port.

<h1>botamusique</h1>
</div>

Botamusique is a [Mumble](https://www.mumble.info/) music bot.
Predicted functionalities will be those people would expect from any classic music player.

[![Build Status](https://ci.azlux.fr/api/badges/azlux/botamusique/status.svg)](https://ci.azlux.fr/azlux/botamusique)

## Features

1. **Support multiple music sources:**
    - Music files in local folders (which can be uploaded through the web interface).
    - Youtube/Soundcloud URLs and playlists (everything supported by youtube-dl).
    - Radio stations from URL and http://www.radio-browser.info API.
2. **Modern and powerful web remote control interface.** Powered by Flask. Which supports:
    - Playlist management.
    - Music library management, including uploading, browsing all files and edit tags, etc.
3. **Powerful command system.** Commands and words the bot says are fully customizable. Support partial-match for commands.
4. **Ducking.** The bot would automatically lower its volume if people are talking.
5. **Stereo sound.** After Mumble 1.4.0, stereo output support has been added. Our bot is designed to work nicely with it naturally.
6. **Multilingual support.** A list of supported languages can be found below.

## Installation

### Dependencies
1. Install python. We require a python version of 3.6 or higher.
1. Install [Opus Codec](https://www.opus-codec.org/) (which should be already installed if you installed Mumble or Murmur, or you may try to install `opus-tools` with your package manager).
1. Install ffmpeg. If ffmpeg isn't in your package manager, you may need to find another source. I personally use [this repository](http://repozytorium.mati75.eu/) on my raspberry.


### Docker
See https://github.com/azlux/botamusique/wiki/Docker-install

Both stable and nightly (developing) build are available!

### Manual install

**Stable release (recommended)**

This is current stable version, with auto-update support. To install the stable release, run these lines in your terminal:
```
curl -Lo botamusique.tar.gz http://packages.azlux.fr/botamusique/sources-stable.tar.gz
tar -xzf botamusique.tar.gz
cd botamusique
python3 -m venv venv
venv/bin/pip install wheel
venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Nightly build (developing version)**
<details>
  <summary>Click to expand!</summary>

This build reflects any newest change in the master branch, with auto-update support baked in. This version follow all commits into the master branch.
```
curl -Lo botamusique.tar.gz http://packages.azlux.fr/botamusique/sources-testing.tar.gz
tar -xzf botamusique.tar.gz
cd botamusique
python3 -m venv venv
venv/bin/pip install wheel
venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
```
</details>

**Build from source code**
<details>
  <summary>Click to expand!</summary>

You can checkout the master branch of our repo and compile everything by yourself.
We will test new features in the master branch, maybe sometimes post some hotfixes.
Please be noted that the builtin auto-update support doesn't track this version.
If you have no idea what these descriptions mean to you, we recommend you install the stable version above.
```
git clone https://github.com/azlux/botamusique.git
cd botamusique
python3 -m venv venv
venv/bin/pip install wheel
venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
(cd web && npm install && npm run build)
venv/bin/python3 ./scripts/translate_templates.py --lang-dir lang/ --template-dir templates/
```
</details>

## Configuration
Please copy `configuration.example.ini` into `configuration.ini`, follow the instructions in that file and uncomment options you would like to modify. Not all sections are needed. You may just keep the options that matter to you. For example, if you only would like to set `host`, all you need you is keep 
```
[server]
host=xxxxxx
```
in your `configuration.ini`.

Please DO NOT MODIFY `configuration.default.ini`, since if the bot realizes one option is undefined in `configuration.ini`, it will look into `configuration.default.ini` for the default value of that option. This file will be constantly overridden in each update.

We list some basic settings for you to quickly get things working.

### Basic settings
1. Usually, the first thing is to set the Murmur server you'd like the bot to connect to. You may also specify which channel the bot stays, and tokens used by the bot.
```
[server]
host = 127.0.0.1
port = 64738
```

2. You need to specify a folder that stores your music files. The bot will look for music and upload files into that folder. You also need to specify a temporary folder to store music files download from URLs.
```
[bot]
music_folder = music_folder/
tmp_folder = /tmp/
```

3. **Web interface is disabled by default** for performance and security reasons. It is extremely powerful, so we encourage you to have a try. To enable it, set
```
[webinterface]
enabled = True
```

Default binding address is
```
listening_addr = 127.0.0.1
listening_port = 8181
```

You can access the web interface through http://127.0.0.1:8181 if you keep it unchanged.

Note: Listening to address `127.0.0.1` will only accept requests from localhost. _If you would like to connect from the public internet, you need to set it to `0.0.0.0`, and set up username and password to impose access control._ In addition, if the bot is behind a router, you should also properly set forwarding rules in you NAT configuration to forward requests to the bot.

4. The default language is English, but you can change it in `[bot]` section:
```
[bot]
language=en_US
```

Available translations can be found inside `lang/` folder. Currently, options are

 - `en_US`, English
 - `es_ES`, Spanish
 - `fr_FR`, French
 - `it_IT`, Italian
 - `ja_JP`, Japanese
 - `zh_CN`, Chinese

5. Generate a certificate (Optional, but recommended)

By default, murmur server uses certificates to identify users. Without a valid certificate, you wouldn't able to register the bot into your Murmur server. Some server even refused users without a certificate. Therefore, it is recommended to generate a certificate for the bot. If you have a certificate (for say, `botmusique.pem` in the folder of the bot), you can specify its location in
```
[server]
certificate=botamusique.pem
```

If you don't have a certificate, you may generate one by:
`openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 3650 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout botamusique.pem -out botamusique.pem -subj ""/CN=botamusique""`


### Sections explained
- `server`: configuration about the server. Will be overridden by the `./mumbleBot.py` parameters.
- `bot`: basic configuration of the bot, eg. name, comment, folder, default volume, etc.
- `webinterface`: basic configuration about the web interface.
- `commands`: you can customize the command you want for each action (eg. put `help = helpme` , the bot will respond to `!helpme`)
- `radio`: a list of default radio (eg. play a jazz radio with the command `!radio jazz`)
- `debug`: option to activate ffmpeg or pymumble debug output.


## Run the bot
If you have set up everything in your `configuration.ini`, you can
`venv/bin/python mumbleBot.py --config configuration.ini`

Or you can
`venv/bin/python mumbleBot.py -s HOST -u BOTNAME -P PASSWORD -p PORT -c CHANNEL -C /path/to/botamusique.pem`

If you want information about auto-starting and auto-restarting of the bot, you can check out the wiki page [Run botamusique as a daemon In the background](https://github.com/azlux/botamusique/wiki/Run-botamusique-as-a-daemon-In-the-background).

**For the detailed manual of using botamusique, please see the [wiki](https://github.com/azlux/botamusique/wiki).**

## Operate the bot

You can control the bot by both commands sent by text message and the web interface.

By default, all commands start with `!`. You can type `!help` in the text message to see the full list of commands supported, or see the examples on the [wiki page](https://github.com/azlux/botamusique/wiki/Command-Help-and-Examples).

The web interface can be used if you'd like an intuitive way of interacting with the bot. Through it is fairly straightforward, a walk-through can be found on the [wiki page](https://github.com/azlux/botamusique/wiki/Web-interface-walk-through).

## Update

If you enable `audo_check_update`, the bot will check for updates every time it starts.
If you are using the recommended install, you can send `!update` to the bot (command by default).

If you are using git, you need to update manually:
```
git pull --all
git submodule update
venv/bin/pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
```


## Known issues

1. During installation, you may encounter the following error:
```
ImportError: libtiff.so.5: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
```
You need to install a missing library: `apt install libtiff5`

2. In the beginning, you may encounter the following error even if you have installed all requirements:
```
Exception: Could not find opus library. Make sure it is installed.
```
You need to install the opus codec (not embedded in all system): `apt install libopus0`

3. MacOS Users may encounter the following error:
```
ImportError: failed to find libmagic.  Check your installation
```
This is caused by missing `libmagic` binaries and can be solved by
```bash
brew install libmagic

```
One may also install `python-magic-bin` instead of `python-magic`.

5. If you have a large amount of music files (>1000), it may take some time for the bot to boot, since
it will build up the cache for the music library on booting. You may want to disable this auto-scanning by
setting ``refresh_cache_on_startup=False`` in `[bot]` section and control the scanning manually by
``!rescan`` command and the *Rescan Files* button on the web interface.

6. Alpine Linux requires some extra dependencies during the installation (in order to compile Pillow):
```
python3-dev musl-lib libmagic jpeg-dev zlib-dev gcc
```
For more information, see [#122](https://github.com/azlux/botamusique/issues/122).

536,536,VikParuchuri/apartment-finder,Python,"Apartment finder
-------------------

This repo contains the code for a bot that will scrape Craigslist for real-time listings matching specific criteria, then alert you in Slack.  This will let you quickly see the best new listings, and contact the owners.  You can adjust the settings to change your price range, what neighborhoods you want to look in, and what transit stations and other points of interest you'd like to be close to.

I successfully used this tool to find an apartment when I moved from Boston to SF.  It saved a good amount of time and money.  Read more about it [here](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/apartment-finding-slackbot/).

It's recommended to follow the Docker installation and usage instructions.

Settings
--------------------

Look in `settings.py` for a full list of all the configuration options.  Here's a high level overview:

* `MIN_PRICE` -- the minimum listing price you want to search for.
* `MAX_PRICE` -- the minimum listing price you want to search for.
* `CRAIGSLIST_SITE` -- the regional Craigslist site you want to search in.
* `AREAS` -- a list of areas of the regional Craiglist site that you want to search in.
* `BOXES` -- coordinate boxes of the neighborhoods you want to look in.
* `NEIGHBORHOODS` -- if the listing doesn't have coordinates, a list of neighborhoods to match on.
* `MAX_TRANSIT_DISTANCE` -- the farthest you want to be from a transit station.
* `TRANSIT_STATIONS` -- the coordinates of transit stations.
* `CRAIGSLIST_HOUSING_SECTION` -- the subsection of Craigslist housing that you want to look in.
* `SLACK_CHANNEL` -- the Slack channel you want the bot to post in.

External Setup
--------------------

Before using this bot, you'll need a Slack team, a channel for the bot to post into, and a Slack API key:

* Create a Slack team, which you can do [here](https://slack.com/create#email).  
* Create a channel for the listings to be posted into.  [Here's](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/201402297-Creating-a-channel) help on this.  It's suggested to use `#housing` as the name of the channel.
* Get a Slack API token, which you can do [here](https://api.slack.com/docs/oauth-test-tokens).  [Here's](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/215770388-Creating-and-regenerating-API-tokens) more information on the process.

Configuration
--------------------

## Docker

* Create a folder called `config`, then put a file called `private.py` inside.
* Specify new values for any of the settings above in `private.py`.
    * For example, you could put `AREAS = ['sfc']` in `private.py` to only look in San Francisco.
    * If you want to post into a Slack channel not called `housing`, add an entry for `SLACK_CHANNEL`.
    * If you don't want to look in the Bay Area, you'll need to update the following settings at the minimum:
        * `CRAIGSLIST_SITE`
        * `AREAS`
        * `BOXES`
        * `NEIGHBORHOODS`
        * `TRANSIT_STATIONS`
        * `CRAIGSLIST_HOUSING_SECTION`
        * `MIN_PRICE`
        * `MAX_PRICE`

## Manual

* Create a file called `private.py` in this folder.
    * Add a value called `SLACK_TOKEN` that contains your Slack API token.
    * Add any other values you want to `private.py`.

Installation + Usage
--------------------

## Docker

* Make sure to do the steps in the configuration section above first.
* Install Docker by following [these instructions](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/).
* To run the program with the default configuration:
    * `docker run -d -e SLACK_TOKEN={YOUR_SLACK_TOKEN} dataquestio/apartment-finder`
* To run the program with your own configuration:
    * `docker run -d -e SLACK_TOKEN={YOUR_SLACK_TOKEN} -v {ABSOLUTE_PATH_TO_YOUR_CONFIG_FOLDER}:/opt/wwc/apartment-finder/config dataquestio/apartment-finder`
    
## Manual

* Look in the `Dockerfile`, and make sure you install any of the apt packages listed there.
* Install Python 3 using Anaconda or another method.
* Install the Python requirements with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
* Run the program with `python main_loop.py`. Results will be posted to your #Housing channel if successful.

Troubleshooting
---------------------

## Docker

* Use `docker ps` to get the id of the container running the bot.
* Run `docker exec -it {YOUR_CONTAINER_ID} /bin/bash` to get a command shell inside the container.
* Run `sqlite listings.db` to run the sqlite command line tool and inspect the database state (the only table is also called `listings`).
    * `select * from listings` will get all of the stored listings.
    * If nothing is in the database, you may need to wait for a bit, or verify that your settings aren't too restrictive and aren't finding any listings.
    * You can see how many listings are being found by looking at the logs.
* Inspect the logs using `tail -f -n 1000 /opt/wwc/logs/afinder.log`.

## Manual

* Look at the stdout of the main program.
* Inspect `listings.db` to ensure listings are being added.

Deploying
---------------------

* Create a server that has Docker installed.  It's suggested to use Digital Ocean.
* Follow the configuration + installation instructions for Docker above.

# _**HisokaBot**_

> HisokaBot is a multipurpose WhatsApp bot using wa-automate-nodejs library!
> Script Copy From [BocchiBot](https://github.com/SlavyanDesu/BocchiBot)
>
>

# Requirements
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
* [FFmpeg](https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/)
* [libwebp](https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/download)
* Any text editor

# Installation
## 📝 Cloning this repo
```cmd
> git clone https://github.com/dxxoo/HisokaBOT-Whatsapp-Bot.git
> cd HisokaBOT-Whatsapp-Bot
```

## ✍️ Editing the file
Edit the required value in `config.json`.
```json
{
    ""ownerBot"": ""62812xxxxxxxx@c.us"", 
    ""prefix"": ""$"",
    ""uaOverride"": ""WhatsApp/2.2037.6 Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_6) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/85.0.4183.83 Safari/537.36"",
    ""itech"": ""api-key"",
    ""nao"": ""api-key"",
    ""vhtear"": ""api-key"",
    ""melodic"": ""administrator"",
    ""tobz"": ""BotWeA""
}
```

`ownerBot`: your WhatsApp number.  
`prefix`: bot's prefix.  
`uaOverride`: your user agent.  
`itech`: I-Tech API key. You can get it [here](https://api.i-tech.id) by creating an account. After that, set your server/host static IP in [here](https://api.i-tech.id/settings/profile).  
`nao`: SauceNAO API key. You can get it [here](https://saucenao.com/user.php) by creating an account.  
`vhtear`: VHTear API key. You can get it [here](https://api.vhtear.com/) by purchasing his API key.  
`melodic`: MelodicXT API key. You can use `administrator` key.   
`tobz`: Tobz API key. You can use `BotWeA` key.   

## 🗣️ Changing language
If you want to change the language to English, replace all `ind` function to `eng`.   
Example:
```js
ind.wrongFormat()
```
To:
```js
eng.wrongFormat()
```

## 🛠️ Installing the FFmpeg
* Download one of the available versions of FFmpeg by clicking [this link](https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/).
* Extract the file to `C:\` path.
* Rename the extracted folder to `ffmpeg`.
* Run Command Prompt as Administrator.
* Run this command:
```cmd
> setx /m PATH ""C:\ffmpeg\bin;%PATH%""
```
It will give us a callback like `SUCCESS: specified value was saved`.
* Now that you've FFmpeg installed, verify that it's working by running this command to see version number:
```cmd
> ffmpeg -version
```

## 📷 Installing the libwebp
The installation is same as you install FFmpeg but whatever. I will make it clear.
* Download the file according to the OS you are using by clicking [this link](https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/download).
* Extract the file to `C:\` path.
* Rename the extracted file to `libwebp`.
* Run Command Prompt as Administrator.
* Run this command:
```cmd
> setx /m PATH ""C:\libwebp\bin;%PATH%""
```
It will give us a callback like `SUCCESS: specified value was saved`.
* Now that you've libwebp installed, verify that it's installed by running this command to see version number:
```cmd
> webpmux -version
```

## 🔍 Installing the dependencies
```cmd
> npm install
```

## 🆗 Running the bot
Regular node:
```cmd
> npm start
```

PM2:
```cmd
> pm2 start index.js
> pm2 monit
```

PM2 with cron job (restart after 5 hours):
```cmd
> pm2 start index.js --cron ""* */5 * * *""
> pm2 monit
```

After that scan the QR code using your WhatsApp in your phone!

# Pokemon GO Bot Desktop
**Development branch is not working for now, please be patient. You can download working 0.0.2 release.**

Desktop Pokemon GO Bot based on [PokemonGo-Bot](https://github.com/PokemonGoF/PokemonGo-Bot)  

Join us at #desktop-porting channel at [our slack chat](https://pokemongo-bot.herokuapp.com/)


## Warning
 - Just getting started, many things are not stable. Help is much appreciated
 - Currently no linux build. If someone with linux wants to work to try to package the application, that would be great
 - To Linux users: Many are having issues getting the bot running. As of right now, it does not seem to be supported, but it eventually will


## Installing from binaries
Extract the application from the .zip file for your platform.
Start the app and select the location of your `encrypt` file.

You can also rename and move the encrypt file to the `gofbot` folder inside the app (windows: `resources/app/gofbot/encrypt.dll` / OSX: `Resources/app/gofbot/encrypt.so`).

### Obtaining encrypt file
You can find the pre-compiled file for your platform [here](https://github.com/PokemonGoMap/PokemonGo-Map/tree/develop/pogom/libencrypt).

### Building encrypt yourself
Run  
```
wget http://pgoapi.com/pgoencrypt.tar.gz && tar -xf pgoencrypt.tar.gz && cd pgoencrypt/src/ && make
```
Then copy `libencrypt.so` to the `gofbot` folder and rename to encrypt.so

539,539,carlos8f/bot18,HTML,"![Bot18](https://bot18.net/assets/bot18_logo_light.png)

Bot18 is a high-frequency cryptocurrency trading bot developed by [Zenbot](https://github.com/DeviaVir/zenbot) creator [carlos8f](https://github.com/carlos8f). More information available from the [bot18.net website](https://bot18.net/).

## BTW, This Is A Beta.

Keep in mind this is the BETA RELEASE. I will be constantly adding/changing stuff. Expect things to be broken, unfinished, and inconsistent. Live trading is discouraged unless you're just playing around with small amounts of currency, or really know what you're doing.

Soon I will develop a roadmap for Beta -> Stable progression, Beta testing rules/instructions, and community tools.

When the project stabilizes, I will conduct a poll for all Beta testers. If the majority feel it's ready for release, I will release the Stable version, end the Beta program, and raise the Unlock Code prices to $99.99 for Single-IP and $499.99 for Unlimited-IP. All Unlock Codes purchased during the Beta period will work with the Stable version, and forever after.

Please be patient and stay tuned!

## We Are Online.

Bot18 is ""online"" software, designed to be invoked without installing. Cloning the repo will only take up space.
The only pre-requisite is having [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) >= 8.3.0 installed. 

Just open a terminal or cmd prompt and type:

```sh
$ npx bot18
```

## Welcome To ZalgoNet. NetSec Is Our Thing.

If running Bot18 for the first time, you'll be asked to log into your ZalgoNet account (browser-based signup form is at [bot18.net/register](https://bot18.net/register)) or you can create a new account through the CLI.

All communications and local storage are safely encrypted using the latest:

- TLS for all client-server transmissions with bot18.net
- [HMAC_SHA-256](http://nacl.cr.yp.to/auth.html) for all signed code from bot18.net
- [XSalsa20 + Poly1305](http://nacl.cr.yp.to/secretbox.html) for secret key encrytion
- [BCrypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt) for secure one-way password hashing

## Unlock Code Required.

To get the most out of Bot18, you'll need an 8-digit Unlock Code, purchasable for $49.99 (for a limited time!) at [bot18.net/beta](https://bot18.net/beta). You can pay by credit card or crypto-currency, and the code never expires and grants you automatic code updates for the entire Bot18 product lifecycle.

Or, you can try out Bot18 for free (enter ""guest"" as the ZalgoNet username or run with `--channel trial`), but you experience will be very sub-optimal. The ""trial"" engine distribution (also known as ""cripple mode"") is heavily DE-optimized (roughly 10x slower), does not support auto-trading strategies, and auto-quits after 15 minutes. If you like what you see, invest in an Unlock Code!

For full licensing details, see [bot18.net/licensing](https://bot18.net/licensing).

## Configuration

- Copy [this example](https://github.com/carlos8f/bot18/blob/with-gui/bot18.config-sample.js) to ""bot18.config.js"" in the same folder where you run your `npx bot18` command, to configure the bot. Make sure you `chmod 0600 bot18.config.js` to protect your configured API keys/passwords from exposure due to liberal filesystem permissions.
- You can also specify a specific conf file with `npx bot18 --conf <path-to-bot18.config.js>`, and/or define an account-wide conf at `~/.bot18/config.js`.
- Bonus points if you have [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com) installed! You can activate data streaming to Mongo by setting `c.mongo.enabled=true` in your conf file.

## Beta Features (So far)

The Beta engine build currently doesn't do anything but print something to stdio:

The current ALPHA version (now being ported to the Beta platform) is an early proof-of-concept, and supports:

  - Monitoring live trade streams from [Bitfinex](https://www.bitfinex.com/) and [Coinbase Pro](https://pro.coinbase.com/) simultaneously.
  - Supports [Coinbase Pro](https://pro.coinbase.com/) (formerly known as GDAX) live trading. Tracks your account balance and reports profit/loss when you trade.
  - Press the ""l"" key to list available key commands. Supports executing manual trades when yellow ""M"" is displayed at the end of the console columns.
  - Enter ""A"" (capitalized) to enable auto-trading (not available in trial mode)
  - The early auto-trading strategy is based on orderbook snapshot power-imbalance, and is highly experimental. **Currently, the Beta's auto-trading strategy is not recommended for serious trading.**

==================

> Easily add four tabbed bottom navigation bar in your app.

![](https://github.com/adib2149/BottomNavBar/blob/master/screenshot/screenshot.gif)

This library aids in adding four tabs in Bottom Navigation Bar, as easily and fast as possible. Th result looks like as it is commonly found in most of the apps, like Quora and others.


Difference from Official [Bottom Navigation View](https://material.io/guidelines/components/bottom-navigation.html)
-----------------
- This library is significantly different from what Google has provided for Android Developers. The official Bottom Navigation View from Google doesn't show text when it has 4 tabs.

![](https://github.com/adib2149/BottomNavBar/blob/master/screenshot/official_bottom_nav_bar.jpg)

- this library helps you add icons and texts with four bottom bars very easily and efficiently, where all stays visisble all the time, just like this one here:

![](https://github.com/adib2149/BottomNavBar/blob/master/screenshot/quora.jpg)

Features
-----------------
- Easily add four tabbed bottom navigation bar with minimal code
- changes color based on accent


Installation
-----------------
Add this in your app's **build.gradle** file:
```
compile 'me.riddhimanadib.bottom-nav-bar:bottom-nav-bar:1.0.1'
```


How to use
-----------------
1. Create four fragments (fragment with appcompat v4) with layouts and method to create new instance.

``` 'java'
public class SampleFragment extends Fragment{

    public static FourthFragment newInstance() {
        return new FourthFragment();
    }

    @Override
    public View onCreateView(LayoutInflater inflater, ViewGroup container, Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        return inflater.inflate(R.layout.fragment_sample, container, false);
    }

}
```
2. Make your activity extend **BottomBarHolderActivity**
``` 'java'
public class MainActivity extends BottomBarHolderActivity
```
3. Clear out setContentView() method and add the following:
``` 'java'
@Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        // remove this: setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);

        // four navigation pages that would be displayed as four tabs
        // contains title, icon and fragment instance
        NavigationPage page1 = new NavigationPage(""Home"", ContextCompat.getDrawable(this, R.drawable.ic_home_black_24dp), FirstFragment.newInstance());
        NavigationPage page2 = new NavigationPage(""Support"", ContextCompat.getDrawable(this, R.drawable.ic_mail_black_24dp), SecondFragment.newInstance());
        NavigationPage page3 = new NavigationPage(""Billing"", ContextCompat.getDrawable(this, R.drawable.ic_assessment_black_24dp), ThirdFragment.newInstance());
        NavigationPage page4 = new NavigationPage(""Profile"", ContextCompat.getDrawable(this, R.drawable.ic_person_black_24dp), FourthFragment.newInstance());

        // add them in a list
        List<NavigationPage> navigationPages = new ArrayList<>();
        navigationPages.add(page1);
        navigationPages.add(page2);
        navigationPages.add(page3);
        navigationPages.add(page4);

        // pass them to super method
        super.setupBottomBarHolderActivity(navigationPages);
    }
```
4. Now build and run!!

Change accent color
-----------------
If you want to change the colors, just override the colors in your **colors.xml** file:
```'xml'
<color name=""colorBackground"">#F8F8F8</color>
<color name=""colorNavAccentSelected"">#9D0E15</color>
<color name=""colorNavAccentUnselected"">#727272</color>
```

<H2 align=center>___________</h2>

## Starting the bot.

Once you've setup your database and your configuration (see below) is complete, simply run:

`python3 -m EvilBot`


### Configuration

There are two possible ways of configuring your bot: a config.py file, or ENV variables.


If you can't have a config.py file (EG on heroku), it is also possible to use environment variables.
The following env variables are supported:

## Session String

* [![Run on Repl.it](https://replit.com/badge/github/TeamUltroid/Ultroid)](http://generatestringsession.sandeep1709.repl.run/)

## Variables

 - `API HASH AND ID`: Your Api Hash And Id from [here](https://my.telegram.org).
 - `ENV`: Setting this to ANYTHING will enable env variables
 - `TOKEN`: Your bot token.
 - `OWNER_ID`: An integer of consisting of your owner ID
 - `OWNER_USERNAME`: Your username

 - `DATABASE_URL`: Your database URL
 - `MESSAGE_DUMP`: optional: a chat where your replied saved messages are stored, to stop people deleting their old 
 - `LOAD`: Space separated list of modules you would like to load
 - `NO_LOAD`: Space separated list of modules you would like NOT to load
 - `WEBHOOK`: Setting this to ANYTHING will enable webhooks when in env mode
 messages
 - `URL`: The URL your webhook should connect to (only needed for webhook mode)

 - `SUDO_USERS`: A space separated list of user_ids which should be considered sudo users
 - `SUPPORT_USERS`: A space separated list of user_ids which should be considered support users (can gban/ungban,
 nothing else)
 - `WHITELIST_USERS`: A space separated list of user_ids which should be considered whitelisted - they can't be banned.
 - `DONATION_LINK`: Optional: link where you would like to receive donations.
 - `CERT_PATH`: Path to your webhook certificate
 - `PORT`: Port to use for your webhooks
 - `DEL_CMDS`: Whether to delete commands from users which don't have rights to use that command
 - `STRICT_GBAN`: Enforce gbans across new groups as well as old groups. When a gbanned user talks, he will be banned.
 - `WORKERS`: Number of threads to use. 8 is the recommended (and default) amount, but your experience may vary.
 __Note__ that going crazy with more threads wont necessarily speed up your bot, given the large amount of sql data

# Telegram Captcha Bot

Telegram bot that validates new users that enter supergroup. Validation works like a simple captcha. Bot written in Go (Golang).

This bot has been tested on several supergroups (2000+ people) for a long time and has shown its effectiveness against spammers.

## Cloud hosted instance of the bot

[@cloud_tg_captcha_bot](https://t.me/cloud_tg_captcha_bot)

## How it works

1. Add the bot to your supergroup
2. Promote the bot for administrator privileges
3. A new user enters your supergroup
4. Bot restricts the user's ability to send messages
5. Bot shows a welcome message and a captcha button to the user
6. If the user doesn't press the button within 30 seconds then the user is banned by the bot

## If you want to run your own instance of the bot

- [Option 1 (the easiest one)](./INSTALL-1.md): docker-compose + already built docker container
- [Option 2](./INSTALL-2.md): docker-compose + build your own docker container
- [Option 3](./INSTALL-3.md): systemd

## Commands

`/healthz` - check that the bot is working correctly

## Сustomization

You can change several bot's settings (welcome message, ban duration, socks5 proxy server) through the configuration file `config.toml`

## Contacts

If you have questions feel free to ask me in TG [@mxssl](https://t.me/mxssl)

# StockBot

StockBot is a Python application for designing and testing your own daily stock trading algorithms.

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install matplotlib and yfinance from your command line.

```bash
pip install matplotlib
pip install yfinance
```

## Usage
You will be asked to enter a ticker for the stock that you want to test the algorithm on.

If you want to modify the algorithm and design your own, you only need to change the Decide() method. That method takes three functions, and you can decide what those are or design your own inputs. My implementation uses moving averages and their derivatives/concavity (the class for which is set up for you to use in your own algorithm).

## Example Output
Here are a couple images depicting the output from an algorithm I developed.

![IBM](https://github.com/ryantcullen/stock-bot/blob/master/Example%20Pictures/lhWY5yX.png?raw=true)


## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

The goal for this script is of course for it to be as robust and generalized as possible in terms of the data available for the user to use to design an algorithm. Add features according to whatever that means to you and submit a pull request to the feature-test branch. If if adds value to the project it will be accepted and merged. 

Please make sure to update tests as appropriate.

Thanks!  :)

544,544,adamfootdev/BottomSheet,Swift,"# BottomSheet

![Feature Graphic](https://github.com/adamfootdev/BottomSheet/blob/main/Assets/feature-graphic.png?raw=true)
![Platform](https://img.shields.io/badge/platforms-iOS%2015.0-F28D00.svg)

BottomSheet makes it easy to take advantage of the new UISheetPresentationController in SwiftUI with a simple .bottomSheet modifier on existing views.

1. [Requirements](#requirements)
2. [Integration](#integration)
3. [Usage](#usage)
    - [Presenting the Sheet](#presenting-the-sheet)
    - [Customizing the Sheet](#customizing-the-sheet)

## Requirements

- iOS 15+
- Xcode 13+

## Integration

### Swift Package Manager

BottomSheet can be added to your app via Swift Package Manager in Xcode using the following configuration:

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: ""https://github.com/adamfootdev/BottomSheet.git"", from: ""0.1.3"")
]
```

## Usage

To get started with BottomSheet, you'll need to import the framework first:

```swift
import BottomSheet
```

### Presenting the Sheet

You can then apply the .bottomSheet modifier to any SwiftUI view, ensuring you attach a binding to the isPresented property - just like the standard .sheet modifier:

```swift
.bottomSheet(isPresented: $isPresented) {
    Text(""Hello, world!"")
}
```

BottomSheet also supports passing an Optional item to it, displaying the sheet if the item is not nil:

```swift
.bottomSheet(item: $item) {
    Text(""Hello, world!"")
}
```

### Customizing the Sheet

BottomSheet can be customized in the same way a UISheetPresentationController can be customized in UIKit. This is done by specifying additional properties in the modifier:

```swift
.bottomSheet(
    isPresented: $isPresented,
    detents: [.medium(), .large()],
    largestUndimmedDetentIdentifier: .large,
    prefersGrabberVisible: true,
    prefersScrollingExpandsWhenScrolledToEdge: true,
    prefersEdgeAttachedInCompactHeight: false,
    widthFollowsPreferredContentSizeWhenEdgeAttached: false,
    onDismiss: { print(""Dismissed"") }
) {
    Text(""Hello, world!"")
}
```

For more information on UISheetPresentationController, read Apple's documentation: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uisheetpresentationcontroller


Please note BottomSheet is currently missing the ability to be resized programmatically as the delegate doesn't work in iOS 15 beta 1. You may also run into issues when used on an iPad with multi-window support and have multiple instances of the same app side-by-side running.

545,545,Falconerd/discord-bot-github,TypeScript,"# Discord Bot [for] GitHub

Version 1.0.0

- Displays notifications in your Discord channels when selected events are triggered.
- Can utilise GitHub Webhook ""secrets"" to secure your updates for private or public repositories.

## Setup

1. Add a webhook to your repository pointing to https://discordbotgithub.herokuapp.com. Select any events you would like to listen for.
    > To add a webhook, visit your repository on github.com, click the settings tab, then webhooks.
2. Set the content type to application/json.
3. Authorise the bot on your server by clicking [this link](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=193000403632128013&permissions=18432&scope=bot%20applications.commands).
4. Once the bot is active on your Discord server, you can use the slash commands listed below.

## About secrets

You can specify a secret value when subscribing to receive webhook events. Keep in mind this secret will be stored in plain text on a server somewhere.

Don't just enter your ""default password"" as the secret, use some random value, unrelated text, or best of all: [a hashed value](https://emn178.github.io/online-tools/sha256.html).

> If anyone guesses your secret, they can also subscribe to your webhook events!

## Usage

Commands all start with `/` and will give you tool-tips if you start typing in Discord.

Command | Description
--------|------------
`/dbg-add <org> <name> [secret] [previews]` | Subscribe the current channel to the repo webhook events. Optionally takes a secret. Optionally enable link previews.
`/dbg-remove <org> <name>` | Unsubscribe the current channel from the repo webhook events.

> Previews will not display if your repo is set to private."

547,547,BotBotMe/botbot-bot,Go,"[![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/circleci/project/github/BotBotMe/botbot-bot.svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/BotBotMe/botbot-bot)


The bot used in botbot.me is a Go (1.2+) program. To install:

    go get github.com/BotBotMe/botbot-bot

External resources:

* A Postgres database with the schema as defined in `schema.sql`.
* A Redis database used as a message bus between the plugins and the bot.

Before loading the sample data from `botbot_sample.dump` you will need to update the script with the irc nick and password.
Installing the database schema and loading sample data:

    psql -U botbot -h localhost -W botbot -f schema.sql
    psql -U botbot -h localhost -W botbot -f botbot_sample.dump

Configuration is handled via environment variables:

    STORAGE_URL=postgres://user:password@host:port/db_name \
    QUEUE_URL=redis://host:port/db_number botbot-bot

## Architecture

Execution starts in `main.go`, in function `main`. That starts the chatbots (via `NetworkManager`), the goroutine which listens for commands from Redis, and the `mainLoop` goroutine, then waits for a Ctrl-C or kill to quit.

The core of the bot is in `mainLoop` (`main.go`). That listens to two Go channels, `fromServer` and `fromBus`. `fromServer` receives everything coming in from IRC. `fromBus` receives commands from the plugins, sent via a Redis list.

A typical incoming request to a plugin would take this path:

```
IRC -> TCP socket -> ChatBot.listen (irc.go) -> fromServer channel -> mainLoop (main.go) -> Dispatcher (dispatch.go) -> redis PUBLISH -> plugin
```

A reply from the plugin takes this path:

```
plugin -> redis LPUSH -> listenCmd (main.go) -> fromBus channel -> mainLoop (main.go) -> NetworkManager.Send (network.go) -> ChatBot.Send (irc.go) -> TCP socket -> IRC
```

And now, in ASCII art:

```
plugins <--> REDIS -BLPOP-> listenCmd (main.go) --> fromBus --> mainLoop (main.go) <-- fromServer <-- n ChatBots (irc.go) <--> IRC
               ^                                                  | |                                      ^
               | PUBLISH                                          | |                                      |
                ------------ Dispatcher (dispatch.go) <----------   ----> NetworkManager (network.go) ----

550,550,jakubroztocil/cointrol,Python,"# Cointrol

Cointrol is a Bitcoin trading bot and real-time dashboard for [Bitstamp](https://bitstamp.net) created by [@jakubroztocil](https://twitter.com/jakubroztocil).

![Dashboard in the browser](_/browser.png ""Dashboard in the browser"")


![cointrol-server and cointrol-trader running in the terminal](_/running-server-and-trader.png ""cointrol-server and cointrol-trader running in the terminal"")

**Cointrol was created to automate Bitcoin speculation.** Besides automated trading based on price change triggers and various trading strategies, it also provides a **real-time updated dashboard for your Bitstamp account** where you can see all your orders and transactions real-time updated (something Bitstamp lacks). The dashboard  for a real-time updated overview can also be used standalone without letting Cointrol make any transactions.

Even though the original idea was to perhaps provide a fully-fledged hosted service, the system remained quite basic as it has only been used by its creator for a period of time in the winter of '13/'14 (when BTC price fluctuations were pretty insane). Some of the obvious limitations—all of which could easily be addressed—are:

* Only basic trading strategies are implemented
* Single user/Bitstamp account is supported
* Only one active trading session at a time
* The **whole account value is used** when trading
* Django admin is used for auth and trading strategy/session manipulations

Even though Cointrol has been used for real transactions, no guarantees are provided in terms of security, correctness, etc. (see `LICENCE`).


## Architecture

The system consists of the following components:

![](_/architecture.png)


### `cointrol-trader`

* Polls various Bitstamp API endpoints
* Writes changes to DB
* Publishes changes to Redis pub/sub
* Opens orders, when suitable


### `cointrol-server`

* Serves Webapp static files
* Exposes DB for Webapp via a REST API
* Forwards Redis pub/sub messages from Trader to Webapp via WebSocket
* Exposes Django administration that is currently used for managing trading sessions


### `webapp`

* REST/WebSocket API-powered Single Page App
* Real-time updated overview on orders, transactions, and trading sessions


## Technology

**The server-side parts** (`cointrol-server` + `cointrol-trader`) are written in **Python 3** (3.3+ is required) and use a mixture of **Django** (models, admin) and **Tornado** (WebSockets, async IO). Other libraries that are used include sockjs-tornado, Django REST framework.

**The single-page webapp** is written in CoffeeScript, Sass, Handlebars and uses Backbone.js, Brunch, socksjs-client, Bootstrap.



## Installation


### 0. Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following software installed on your system:

* Python 3.3+
* Redis
* npm


### 1. Install Cointrol

#### 1.1 Install `cointrol-server` & `cointrol-trader`
```bash
mkdir Cointrol && cd Cointrol

# Create an isolated Python virtual environment
pip install virtualenv
virtualenv ./virtualenv --python=$(which python3)

# Activate the virtualenv
# IMPORTANT: it needs to be activated every time before you run
#            a manage.py or cointrol-* command.
. virtualenv/bin/activate

# Get the code
git clone https://github.com/jakubroztocil/cointrol

# Create a local settings file
echo 'from .settings_dev import *' > cointrol/cointrol/conf/settings_local.py

# Install Python requirements
pip install -r cointrol/cointrol/conf/requirements.txt

# Initialize the database
cointrol/manage.py migrate

# Install cointrol-*
pip install -e ./cointrol

```

#### 1.2 Build the single-page app web client and install its dependencies


```bash
# Install dependencies
sudo npm -g install bower
cd cointrol/webapp
npm install
bower install

# Build the app
brunch build

# Use `brunch watch` during development
```

### 2. Create a Django user

```bash
. virtualenv/bin/activate
cointrol/manage.py createsuperuser
```


### 3. Configure Bitstamp API access

#### 3.1 Get API key and secret

Go to [https://www.bitstamp.net/account/security/api](https://www.bitstamp.net/account/security/api). Create a new key and configure permissions for it. Cointrol needs at least the following permissions:

 * `Account balance`
 * `User transactions`
 * `Open orders`
 
If you want Cointrol make transactions for you, select two following permissions as well:

  * `Buy limit order`
  * `Sell limit order`

Don't forget to activate the key by clicking ""Activate"" and confirming the email you receive from Bitstamp. 


#### 3.2 Configure Cointrol with the API credentials
1. Activate the virtualenv and run `cointrol-server`
2. Go to [http://localhost:8000/admin/core/account/1/](http://localhost:8000/admin/core/account/1/) and enter your Bitstamp username as well as the API key and secret to the form there.

## Usage


### Start `cointrol-server`


```bash
. virtualenv/bin/activate
cointrol-server
```


By default, it will run on [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000). You can change the port with `--port=<port>`. 

Use this convenient link to log in: [http://localhost:8000/admin/login/?next=/](http://localhost:8000/admin/login/?next=/) — the Django admin interface is used for authentication, and this link ensures redirection back to the app after signing you in.

**Connection indicator colors explained:**

![green](_/connection-green.png)

Green: The web app has a WebSocket connection to `cointrol-server`, and *have* recently heard from `cointrol-trader`. 

![amber](_/connection-amber.png)


Amber: The web app has a WeSocket connection to `cointrol-server`, but 
*have not* heard from `cointrol-trader` in a while.

![red](_/connection-red.png)

Red: The web app couldn't establish WebSocket connection to `cointrol-server`.




### Start `cointrol-trader`

```bash
. virtualenv/bin/activate
cointrol-trader
```

Note, until trading is configured  and the `COINTROL_DO_TRADE` settings set to `True` (covered in a later step), the trader won't make any transactions. It only pulls your data from Bitstamp to populate the dashboard view.

### Trading

Until the following steps are completed and trading is explicitly enabled, Cointrol doesn't attempt to make any transaction on your behalf:

1. Through the admin ([http://localhost:8000/admin/](http://localhost:8000/admin/)) you can create a trading strategy profile. It can be for the *fixed* (fixed price points in USD are used as buy/sell triggers) or the *relative* (percentage of the initial BTC price are used) strategy.
2. Create a trading session (also in the admin interface).
3. To perform actual transactions, you'll have to enable them in the settings (we used the `settings_dev` module which disables them). Add `COINTROL_DO_TRADE = True` to your `cointrol/cointrol/conf/settings_local.py`.


## Settings

The settings is resolved in this order: 

1. `settings_local.py`
2. `settings_(prod|dev).py` 
3. `settings_defaults.py`
4.  Django defaults

During the installation process, you've created `cointrol/cointrol/conf/settings_local.py` which imports settings from the `settings_dev.py` file. All the settings are [Django settings](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.7/ref/settings/). The only non-Django settings is `COINTROL_DO_TRADE` (`False` in `dev`, `True` in `prod`). You can override any of the default settings in the `settings_local.py` file.

Besides `settings_dev.py`, the `conf` directory also has `settings_prod.py`, which is more suitable for production use. It defines logging configuration which makes messages of a level `>=` `WARNING` logged by the trader to be sent to you via email (e.g. when the trader places an order or there is an error). If you decide to use this settings file (by changing the import in `settings_local.py` to `from .settings_prod import *`, you'll have to configure at least [`DATABASES`](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.7/ref/settings/#databases), [`ADMINS`](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.7/ref/settings/#admins) and [`SECRET_KEY`](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.7/ref/settings/#secret-key) as well in your in `settings_local.py`.

[![Swift Package Manager compatible](https://img.shields.io/badge/Swift%20Package%20Manager-compatible-brightgreen.svg)](https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager)

**BottomSheet** is an implementation of custom modal presentation style for thumb-friendly interactive views anchored to the bottom of the screen.

- [x] Custom `UIViewControllerTransitioningDelegate` for dismissable modal bottom sheets
- [x] `BottomSheetView` for displaying complementary content as a standard bottom sheet view
- [x] Expanding bottom sheets with multiple states to transition between
- [x] Support for automatic view height based on Auto Layout constraints
- [x] Beatiful spring animation

## Demo

<p align=""center"">
  <img src=""/GitHub/demo.gif""/>
</p>

## Installation

**BottomSheet** is available through [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage). Append this line to your `Cartfile`:

```ruby
github ""finn-no/BottomSheet""
```

**BottomSheet** is also available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod ""FINNBottomSheet"", git: ""https://github.com/finn-no/BottomSheet.git""
```

To integrate using Apple's Swift package manager, add the following as a dependency to your Package.swift:

```swift
.package(name: ""FINNBottomSheet"", url: ""https://github.com/finn-no/BottomSheet.git"", .upToNextMajor(from: ""1.0.0""))
```

## Usage

View controller -based presentation:

```swift
import FINNBottomSheet

let transitioningDelegate = BottomSheetTransitioningDelegate(
    contentHeights: [.bottomSheetAutomatic, UIScreen.main.bounds.size.height - 200],
    startTargetIndex: 0
)
let viewController = UIViewController()
viewController.transitioningDelegate = transitioningDelegate
viewController.modalPresentationStyle = .custom

present(viewController, animated: true)
```

View -based presentation:

```swift
import FINNBottomSheet

let contentView = UIView()
contentView.backgroundColor = .red

let bottomSheetView = BottomSheetView(
    contentView: contentView,
    contentHeights: [100, 500]
)

// Can be presented in any UIView subclass
bottomSheetView.present(in: viewController.view, targetIndex: 0)
```

## Known limitations

### Using `.bottomSheetAutomatic`:

When using `.bottomSheetAutomatic` to calculate the content height and your view is constrained using the `layoutMarginsGuide`, you must be aware that the returned content height may actually be higher than the compressed layout size of your view. Also, it may result in the transition animation freezing. This problem is avoided simply by not using the `layoutMarginsGuide`.

### BottomSheetTransitioningDelegate

To avoid ""glitches"" you might need to keep a strong reference to the transitioning delegate (`BottomSheetTransitioningDelegate`) until the bottom sheet animation is complete.

## Create new releases

### Setup
- Install dependencies with `bundle install` (dependencies will be installed in `./bundler`)
- Fastlane will use the GitHub API, so make sure to create a personal access token [here](https://github.com/settings/tokens) and place it within an environment variable called **`FINN_GITHUB_COM_ACCESS_TOKEN`**.
  - When creating a token, you only need to give access to the scope `repo`.
  - There are multiple ways to make an environment variable, for example by using a `.env` file or adding it to `.bashrc`/`.bash_profile`). Don't forget to run `source .env` (for whichever file you set the environment variables in) if you don't want to restart your shell.
  - Run `bundle exec fastlane verify_environment_variable` to see if it is configured correctly.
- Run `bundle exec fastlane verify_ssh_to_github` to see if ssh to GitHub is working.

### Make release
- Run `bundle exec fastlane` and choose appropriate lane. Follow instructions, you will be asked for confirmation before all remote changes.
- After the release has been created you can edit the description on GitHub by using the printed link.

## Interesting things

### Changelogs

This project has a `Gemfile` that specify some development dependencies, one of those is `pr_changelog` which is a tool that helps you to generate changelogs from the Git history of the repo. You install this by running `bundle install`.

To get the changes that have not been released yet just run:

```
$ pr_changelog
```

If you want to see what changes were released in the last version, run:

```
$ pr_changelog --last-release
```

You can always run the command with the `--help` flag when needed.

## 快速上手

通常ConvexAppBar可以通过设置bottomNavigationBar与Scaffold一起使用。

ConvexAppBar具有两个构造函数，ConvexAppBar()将使用默认样式来简化选项卡的创建。

将此添加到您程序包的pubspec.yaml文件中，注意使用最新版本[![Pub](https://img.shields.io/pub/v/convex_bottom_bar.svg)](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/convex_bottom_bar):

```yaml
dependencies:
  convex_bottom_bar: ^latest_version
```

```dart
import 'package:convex_bottom_bar/convex_bottom_bar.dart';

Scaffold(

**Flutter Version Support**
由于Flutter迭代非常快。SDK本身有可能出现不兼容的API变更，我们将继续支持flutter稳定版本，非稳定的beta、dev channel
通过单独版本号进行兼容。

|            **Stable Flutter Version**             |            **Package Version**             | **More** |
| :------------------------------: | :------------------------------: | :------------------------------: |
|    >=1.20    |    >=2.4.0      | 从 v1.20开始, Stack组件的API发送不兼容变更 |
|    <1.20     |    <2.4.0     | v1.20稳定版发布后，我们对老版本如v1.17, v1.12 的支持将不再继续更新 |

如果你只需要一个单独的按钮，不妨试试 `ConvexButton`.

## 角标
如果需要在TAB上添加徽章/角标，请使用`ConvexAppBar.badge`来构建。

[![badge demo](doc/badge-demo-preview.gif)](doc/badge-demo.mp4 ""badge demo"")

```dart
ConvexAppBar.badge({0: '99+', 1: Icons.assistant_photo, 2: Colors.redAccent},
  items: [
    TabItem(icon: Icons.home, title: 'Home'),
    TabItem(icon: Icons.map, title: 'Discovery'),
    TabItem(icon: Icons.add, title: 'Add'),
  ],
  onTap: (int i) => print('click index=$i'),
);
```

`badge()`方法接受一个角标数组； 角标是带有选项卡项的映射，每个条目的值可以是String，IconData，Color或Widget。

## 单独按钮
![button](doc/appbar-single-shape.png)

```dart
Scaffold(
  appBar: AppBar(title: const Text('ConvexButton Example')),
  body: Center(child: Text('count $count')),
  bottomNavigationBar: ConvexButton.fab(
    onTap: () => setState(() => count++),
  ),
);
```

## 主题
AppBar默认使用内置样式，您可能需要为其设置主题。 以下是一些支持的属性：

![](doc/appbar-theming.png)

| Attributes      | Description                           |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| backgroundColor | AppBar 背景                     |
| gradient        | 渐变属性，可以覆盖backgroundColor|
| height          | AppBar 高度                         |
| color           | icon/text 的颜色值                   |
| activeColor     | icon/text 的**选中态**颜色值 |
| curveSize       | 凸形大小             |
| top   | 凸形到AppBar上边缘的距离 |
| style | 支持的样式: **fixed, fixedCircle, react, reactCircle**, ... |
| chipBuilder | 角标构造器builder,  **ConvexAppBar.badge**会使用默认样式 |

## 样式重载
重载Tab内置样式。 该API与`ConvexAppBar.builder`不同，为了满足您可能需要更新选项卡样式而不定义新的选项卡样式。
**温馨提示:**  
则此Hook能力是有限的，如果您提供的尺寸与内部样式不匹配，并且可能导致`overflow broken`。

```dart
StyleProvider(
  style: Style(),
  child: ConvexAppBar(
    initialActiveIndex: 1,
    height: 50,
    top: -30,
    curveSize: 100,
    style: TabStyle.fixedCircle,
    items: [
      TabItem(icon: Icons.link),
      TabItem(icon: Icons.import_contacts),
      TabItem(title: ""2020"", icon: Icons.work),
    ],
    backgroundColor: _tabBackgroundColor,
  ),
)
class Style extends StyleHook {
  @override
  double get activeIconSize => 40;

  @override
  double get activeIconMargin => 10;

  @override
  double get iconSize => 20;

  @override
  TextStyle textStyle(Color color) {
    return TextStyle(fontSize: 20, color: color);
  }
}
```

## RTL支持
RTL的内部适配，如果你配置了Directionality，将自动支持ltf和rtl两种布局风格。
```dart
Directionality(
  textDirection: TextDirection.rtl,
  child: Scaffold(body:ConvexAppBar(/*TODO ...*/)),
)
```

## 自定义样例

如果默认样式与您的情况不符，请尝试使用`ConvexAppBar.builder()`，它可以让您自定义几乎所有TAB样式。
```dart
Scaffold(
  bottomNavigationBar: ConvexAppBar.builder(
    count: 5,
    backgroundColor: Colors.blue,
    style: TabStyle.fixed,
    itemBuilder: Builder(),
  )
);

/*user defined class*/
class Builder extends DelegateBuilder {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context, int index, bool active) {
    return Text('TAB $index');
  }
}
```

完整的自定义示例可以在[example](example)中找到。

## What its included in this repo?

1) Two bots written in JS that observe the prices changes on a pre user-defined liquidity pool at Uniswap V2 / Sushiswap and determine if its possibly to make a profit buying tokens cheaper at one exchange to selling them after for a bigger amount in the other, keeping the difference (profit). They only differ in how they get the tokens for making the arbitrage. One bot uses **flashswap**, this kind of swaps basically works as if you were taking a ‘free of charge' loan (no fee associated like normal loans works on 'real banks') to borrow the token needed to do the trade, repaying then the loan with some of the tokens you received, keeping the remaining to you. The other uses **normal swaps**, this bot require you to be holding the tokens needed to do the trade but it contrast it cost less gas to execute. In both cases Uniswap, like all the others exchanges, charges on you a fee for using their services (swapping tokens in this case), this fee currently is 0.3%. To see more on how flashswap or normal swaps works visit the [Uniswap docs](https://uniswap.org/docs/v2/).

2) A demo that you can easily run to see the bots in action. Basically consist of forking ethereum mainnet locally, run the demo script that do the set ups for you and execute the bots.

3) Proposed improvements for possible production stage.

First it will be explained how to install the required tools (probably you have already installed some of them, feel free to jump to the sections that you wish). Then I introduce how to run the demo, here assume that you are kind of newbie in blockchain and you don’t understand quiet well whats happening so its deeply explained. After, a very basic guide line to put the bots to work on an ethereum network, mainnet or testnet, I assume you know what you are doing at this point. Finally some improvements for a possible production stage and useful resourses are given.

## Installation

On Debian based linux distro (like Ubuntu), open a terminal and follow the instructions bellow.

1) Install git, to clone the repo  

```bash
sudo apt install git-all
```
2) Install nvm, tool for manage node versions in your system.
```bash
sudo apt install curl
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/master/install.sh | bash
``` 
3) Install node version required.
 
```bash
nvm install 12.22.1
```
4) Clone the repo and install its dependencies.
```bash
cd
git clone https://github.com/6eer/uniswap-sushiswap-arbitrage-bot.git
cd uniswap-sushiswap-arbitrage-bot
npm install
npm install -g ganache-cli
git clone https://github.com/sushiswap/sushiswap.git
```
## Running the demo

1) The ‘annoying’ part. In order to execute the bots you need to create an account on an ethereum provider, companies that maintain their own ethereum nodes, which you can use generally for free (with limited functions, but for us, it enough) to communicate with the ethereum blockchain. You can use whatever provider you desired (check what services they gives you for free) but for run the demo you need a provider that gives access to an **archive node** (special kind of node) and *Alchemy* do it for free, besides you can sing up with google account, so, its quiet fast. Once logged in, generally you must to create a project and then they assign to it a ‘link’ (indeed its a kind of key) that allows you to uses their services. In Alchemy looks like,

   https://eth-mainnet.alchemyapi.io/v2/qolQHYLqPhksKzW-QBEzlzdW14pRZnTr


2) Create a .env file on the root project directory with the paremeters of the bots, for the demo an example .env with valid parameters can be created as follow
```bash
printf ""ADDR_ARBITRAGE_CONTRACT = '0x3eA3E0816b7Caf6e12D5083D02D4cb5e4330CE18'\nADDR_DAI = '0x6b175474e89094c44da98b954eedeac495271d0f'\nADDR_ETH = '0xc02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2'\nADDR_SFACTORY = '0xC0AEe478e3658e2610c5F7A4A2E1777cE9e4f2Ac'\nADDR_SROUTER = '0xd9e1cE17f2641f24aE83637ab66a2cca9C378B9F'\nADDR_TOKEN0 = '0x55B7162F06e4Cf5b2e06E5757c1e474dB8E10516'\nADDR_TOKEN1 = '0xedC71FcFD28912ab32b21Efaa906f39F628De110'\nADDR_UFACTORY = '0x5C69bEe701ef814a2B6a3EDD4B1652CB9cc5aA6f'\nADDR_UROUTER = '0x7a250d5630B4cF539739dF2C5dAcb4c659F2488D'\nADDR_UTILS = '0xE78941610Ffef0eEA391BAe6d842175E389973E9'\nLOCAL_DEPLOYMENT = true\nPRICE_TOKEN0 = 190.2\nPRICE_TOKEN1 = 235.7\nPRIVATE_KEY = '0x4f3edf983ac636a65a842ce7c78d9aa706d3b113bce9c46f30d7d21715b23b1d'\nPROJECT_ID = '3c40e9b697e547b4ae7e72dceb82ad11'\nVALID_PERIOD = 5\n"" > .env
```
3) Open a new terminal on the same location and execute, replacing the ‘link’ used here as example with your Alchemy link
```bash
ganache-cli --fork https://eth-mainnet.alchemyapi.io/v2/qolQHYLqPhksKzW-QBEzlzdW14pRZnTr -b 2 -d
```
4) On the terminal thats you use to create .env or in a new one run the demo script with -a or -b option for use one of the two swaps directions possibles.
```bash
node ./src/demo_environment.js -a
#or
node ./src/demo_environment.js -b
```
This script will create two tokens and their correspond liquidity pools on Uniswap and Sushiswap with certain amounts that make an arbitrage opportunity possible.

5) Finally, execute the bot you want to use.
```bash
node ./src/bot_flashswap.js
#or
node ./src/bot_normalswap.js
```
Once the arbitrage occur (you will notice because the logs on the console) Ctrol+C to stop the bots.

## Running on a ethereum network

1) Need to set up a provider, the code its setted up to use Infura but you can easily change it.

2) Deploy the arbitrager contract if you gonna use bot_flashswap.js and in both cases you need to deploy the utils contract.

3) Create a .env file on the project directory with valid parameter values, see bot_flashswap.js or bot_normalswap.js to see what they are.

4) Assuming you own an account with the enough eth for paying the gas and fees (and if you use normal swap the tokens as well) you are ready to run the bots. **_Remember that as they are, the bots are not ready for production and even with the changes proposed bellow I dont recommend use them for that porpuse, do it at your own risk_**.

## Notes

+ **10/07/21 ->** If u are having gas issues, check out [this tiny thread](https://github.com/6eer/uniswap-sushiswap-arbitrage-bot/issues/2)

+ **14/06/21 ->** I realize that the arbitrage, in the manner that I did it, its not rigth conceptually. The proper way, I think, it would have been using a CEX (Centralized EXchange) like Binance or Coinbase as off-chain oracle and use Avee (lending platform) [flashloans](https://aave.com/flash-loans/) (similar to how flashswaps works) to arbitrage whatever DEX (Decentralized EXchanges) I wished. The only 'drawback' that I can see with this approach is that you must pay back the flashloan in the same asset you borrow so you probably need and extra trade. Personally I only understand how Uniswap like exchanges works, in other words, AMMs that uses the constant product formula to set the price [(here more info)](https://defiweekly.substack.com/p/the-state-of-amms-3ad). What Im trying to say its that I dont know if other kind of AMMs are arbitrageable (I remember hear about a DEX that auto regulates its prices), so keep that in mind. But, that said, I think it is a good project to get confidence with the ethereum blackchain, understand how it works, the software stack and learn how one of the most important protocols that the network has, Uniswap, works. Good luck!

## Considerations for production

+ Read [this issue](https://github.com/6eer/uniswap-sushiswap-arbitrage-bot/issues/5) (useful).

+ Its **_very important_** that you set up an aproppiate value to amountOutMin on
```javascript
function swapExactTokensForTokens(
    uint amountIn,
    uint amountOutMin,
    address[] calldata path,
    address to,
    uint deadline
)
```
for safety reasons, if not you could be losing money. see Uniswap docs for more info. (This function is used in bot_normalswap.js and Arbitrager.sol).

+ You probably wanna embedded the logic available at Utils.sol on the bots scripts, avoiding the cost of deploy the Utils contract.

+ Use child process for each block.

+ Maybe an improvement on robustness using event subscription to UniswapV2Pair.Swap() and ERC20.Approval() events can be achieved.

+ Select the pools automatically based on, for example, the amount of arbitrage opportunities in the past.

+ Probably dockerized the app its a good idea (for portability reasons).

+ Instead of printing to the console, print only the trades on a file (kinda silly, I know).

- [Configuration](#configuration)

## Getting started

This library is available on Maven Central, install it by adding the following dependency to your <b>build.gradle</b>:
```gradle
implementation 'nl.joery.animatedbottombar:library:1.1.0'
```

*Versions 1.0.x can only be used with jCenter, versions 1.1.x and up can be used with Maven Central.*

Define `AnimatedBottomBar` in your XML layout with custom attributes.
```xml
<nl.joery.animatedbottombar.AnimatedBottomBar
    android:id=""@+id/bottom_bar""
    android:background=""#FFF""
    android:layout_width=""match_parent""
    android:layout_height=""wrap_content""
    app:abb_selectedTabType=""text""
    app:abb_indicatorAppearance=""round""
    app:abb_indicatorMargin=""16dp""
    app:abb_indicatorHeight=""4dp""
    app:abb_tabs=""@menu/tabs""
    app:abb_selectedIndex=""1"" />
```

Create a file named `tabs.xml` in the `res/menu/` resources folder:
```xml
<menu xmlns:android=""http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"">
    <item
        android:id=""@+id/tab_home""
        android:icon=""@drawable/home""
        android:title=""@string/home"" />
    <item
        android:id=""@+id/tab_alarm""
        android:icon=""@drawable/alarm""
        android:title=""@string/alarm"" />
    <item
        android:id=""@+id/tab_bread""
        android:icon=""@drawable/bread""
        android:title=""@string/bread"" />
    <item
        android:id=""@+id/tab_cart""
        android:icon=""@drawable/cart""
        android:title=""@string/cart"" />
</menu>
```

Get notified when the selected tab changes by setting callbacks:
```kotlin
bottom_bar.onTabSelected = {
    Log.d(""bottom_bar"", ""Selected tab: "" + it.title)
}
bottom_bar.onTabReselected = {
    Log.d(""bottom_bar"", ""Reselected tab: "" + it.title)
}
```

Or set a listener if you need more detailed information:
```kotlin
bottom_bar.setOnTabSelectListener(object : AnimatedBottomBar.OnTabSelectListener {
    override fun onTabSelected(
        lastIndex: Int,
        lastTab: AnimatedBottomBar.Tab?,
        newIndex: Int,
        newTab: AnimatedBottomBar.Tab
    ) {
        Log.d(""bottom_bar"", ""Selected index: $newIndex, title: ${newTab.title}"")
    }

    // An optional method that will be fired whenever an already selected tab has been selected again.
    override fun onTabReselected(index: Int, tab: AnimatedBottomBar.Tab) {
        Log.d(""bottom_bar"", ""Reselected index: $index, title: ${tab.title}"")
    }

```

## Managing tabs
Short overview on how to manage tabs using code.

### Creating new tabs
```kotlin
// Creating a tab by passing values
val bottomBarTab1 = AnimatedBottomBar.createTab(drawable, ""Tab 1"")

// Creating a tab by passing resources
val bottomBarTab2 = AnimatedBottomBar.createTab(R.drawable.ic_home, R.string.tab_2, R.id.tab_home)
```
### Adding new tabs
```kotlin 
// Adding a tab at the end
AnimatedBottomBar.addTab(bottomBarTab1)

// Add a tab at a specific position
AnimatedBottomBar.addTabAt(1, bottomBarTab2)
```

### Removing tabs
```kotlin
// Removing a tab by object reference
val tabToRemove = AnimatedBottomBar.tabs[1]
AnimatedBottomBar.removeTab(tabToRemove)

// Removing a tab at a specific position
AnimatedBottomBar.removeTabAt(tabPosition)

// Removing a tab by the given ID resource
AnimatedBottomBar.removeTabById(R.id.tab_home)
```

### Selecting tabs
```kotlin
// Selecting a tab by object reference
val tabToSelect = AnimatedBottomBar.tabs[1]
AnimatedBottomBar.selectTab(tabToSelect)

// Selecting a tab at a specific position
AnimatedBottomBar.selectTabAt(1)

// Selecting a tab by the given ID resource
AnimatedBottomBar.selectTabById(R.id.tab_home)
```

### Enabling / disabling tabs
```kotlin
// Disabling a tab by object reference
val tabToDisable = AnimatedBottomBar.tabs[1]
AnimatedBottomBar.setTabEnabled(tabToDisable, false) // Use true for re-enabling the tab

// Disabling a tab at a specific position
AnimatedBottomBar.setTabEnabledAt(1, false)

// Disabling a tab by the given ID resource
AnimatedBottomBar.setTabEnabledById(R.id.tab_home, false)
```

### Intercepting tabs
This could be useful for example restricting access to a premium area. You can use a callback or a more detailed listener:
```kotlin
bottom_bar.onTabIntercepted = {
    if (newTab.id == R.id.tab_pro_feature && !hasProVersion) {
        // e.g. show a dialog
        false
    }
    true
}
```

Detailed listener:
```kotlin
bottom_bar.setOnTabInterceptListener(object : AnimatedBottomBar.OnTabInterceptListener {
    override fun onTabIntercepted(
        lastIndex: Int,
        lastTab: AnimatedBottomBar.Tab?,
        newIndex: Int,
        newTab: AnimatedBottomBar.Tab
    ): Boolean {
        if (newTab.id == R.id.tab_pro_feature && !hasProVersion) {
            // e.g. show a dialog
            return false
        }
        return true
    }
})
```

## Tab badges
Instructions on how to set badges for tabs, a `AnimatedBottomBar.Badge` object should be supplied to the BottomBar, note that it is also possible to add badges without text.

### Adding badges
```kotlin
// Adding a badge by tab reference
val tabToAddBadgeAt = AnimatedBottomBar.tabs[1]
AnimatedBottomBar.setBadgeAtTab(tabToAddBadgeAt, AnimatedBottomBar.Badge(""99""))

// Adding a badge at a specific position
AnimatedBottomBar.setBadgeAtTabIndex(1, AnimatedBottomBar.Badge(""99""))

// Adding a badge at the given ID resource
AnimatedBottomBar.setBadgeAtTabId(R.id.tab_home, AnimatedBottomBar.Badge(""99""))
```

### Removing badges
```kotlin
// Removing a badge by tab reference
val tabToRemoveBadgeFrom = AnimatedBottomBar.tabs[1]
AnimatedBottomBar.clearBadgeAtTab(tabToRemoveBadgeFrom)

// Removing a badge at a specific position
AnimatedBottomBar.clearBadgeAtTabIndex(1, AnimatedBottomBar.Badge(""99""))

// removing a badge at the given ID resource
AnimatedBottomBar.clearBadgeAtTabId(R.id.tab_home, AnimatedBottomBar.Badge(""99""))
```

### Styling individual badges
Additionally there is also the possibility to individually style badges.
```kotlin
AnimatedBottomBar.Badge(
    text = ""99"",
    backgroundColor = Color.RED,
    textColor = Color.GREEN,
    textSize =  12.spPx // in pixels
)
```

## Usage with ViewPager
It is easy to use the BottomBar with a ViewPager or ViewPager2, you can simply use the `setupWithViewPager()` method. Please note that the number of tabs and ViewPager pages need to be identical in order for it to function properly.

<b>Usage</b>
```kotlin
// For ViewPager use:
bottom_bar.setupWithViewPager(yourViewPager)

// For ViewPager2 use:
bottom_bar.setupWithViewPager2(yourViewPager2)
```

## Configuration
An overview of all configuration options. All options can also be accessed and set programmatically, by their equivalent name.

Simply clone the repository and run the main file:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/indianbhaiya/IndianBot
cd Indianbot
virtualenv -p /usr/bin/python3 venv
. ./venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
# <Create local_config.py with variables as given below>
python3 -m userbot
```

An example `local_config.py` file could be:

**Not All of the variables are mandatory**

**The Userbot should work by setting only the first two variables**

```python3
from heroku_config import Var

class Development(Var):
  APP_ID = 6
  # 6 is the length of api id
  API_HASH = ""eb06d4abfb49dc3eeb1aeb98ae0f581e""
  # Use Your Own Api Hash
```

### UniBorg Configuration

The UniBorg Config is situated in `userbot/uniborgConfig.py`.

**Heroku Configuration** Simply just leave the Config as it is.

**Local Configuration** Fortunately there are no Mandatory vars for the UniBorg
Support Config.

## Mandatory Vars

- Only two of the environment variables are mandatory.
- This is because of `telethon.errors.rpc_error_list.ApiIdPublishedFloodError`
  - `APP_ID`: You can get this value from https://my.telegram.org //Not getting
    your telegram channel please help me
  - `API_HASH`: You can get this value from https://my.telegram.org
- The userbot will not work without setting the mandatory vars.

As communicated earlier in August 2019, this repository has been archived and the source code is not maintained by the SAP Conversational AI team.

All Bot Connector capabilities are integrated in our [bot building platform](https://cai.tools.sap).

If you are running a standard / customised version of open source bot connector on your platform, **please migrate to the bot connector available on our bot building platform** (hosted in on SAP Cloud Platform), which offers integration with a wide number of channels which that we plan to make more robust.

If you have any questions, please [contact our team](https://cai.tools.sap/contact).

## Bot Connector

Bot Connector allows you to connect your bot to multiple messaging channels.

It provides a higher level API to manage several messaging platforms at once, and lets you focus on your bot by using a simple and unique format to talk to the entire world.

## Documentation

You can see the API documentation [here](https://sapconversationalai.github.io/bot-connector/)

Or generate the documentation with the following command:
```bash
yarn docs && open docs/index.html
```

## Supported Channels

Bot Connector supports the following channels:

* [Kik](https://github.com/SAPConversationalAI/bot-connector/wiki/Channel---Kik)
* [Slack](https://github.com/SAPConversationalAI/bot-connector/wiki/Channel---Slack)
* [Facebook Messenger](https://github.com/SAPConversationalAI/bot-connector/wiki/Channel---Messenger)

## Getting started

The following examples use [yarn](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn) package manager but you can use your favorite one like npm, or pnpm.

In order to run the connector you need MongoDB and Redis installed and running. The configuration files for both are stored in *config* directory.

### Installation

Clone the repository and install the dependencies

```sh
git clone https://github.com/SAPConversationalAI/bot-connector.git
cd bot-connector
yarn install
```

### Available Commands

* `yarn start` - Start application in production mode
* `yarn start:dev` - Start application in development mode
* `yarn start:dev:debug` - Start application in development mode with debugger
* `yarn test` - Run unit & integration tests
* `yarn test:debug` - Run unit & integration tests with debugger
* `yarn test:coverage` - Run unit & integration tests with coverage report
* `yarn lint` - Run ESLint
* `yarn build` - Build artifacts for production
* `yarn docs` - Generate apidoc documentation

#### Configurations/Environments

You need to create a configuration file based on the following schema:

config/{env}.js (e.g. `config/development.js` for `NODE_ENV=development`)

```
module.exports = {
  db: {
    host: 'localhost',
    port: 27017,
    dbName: 'botconnector',
  },
  server: {
    port: 8080,
  },
  redis: {
    port: 6379,
    host: 'localhost',
    auth: '',
    db: 7,
    options: {},  // see https://github.com/mranney/node_redis#rediscreateclient
  },
  mail: {},  // valid object to be passed to nodemail.createTransport()
  base_url: '',  // base url of the connector
  facebook_app_id: '',
  facebook_app_secret: '',
  facebook_app_webhook_token: '',
  amazon_client_id: '',  // Client ID for use with Login with Amazon (Amazon Alexa channel)
  amazon_client_secret: '',  // Client Id for use with Login with Amazon (Amazon Alexa channel)
}

```

#### Running in development mode (hot reload)

```bash
yarn start:dev
```

#### Setup your connector

First of all, you need to create a connector with the Bot Connector's API.
```sh
curl -X POST 'http://localhost:8080/connectors' --data 'url=YOUR_BOT_ENDPOINT_URL'
```

Then you need some code so the Bot Connector, via the *connector* you've just created, can send you the messages it receives. You can use the code from the *example* as a starter.
```bash
cd example
yarn install
yarn start
```

Now that your bot (well, your code) and the Bot Connector are running, you have to create channels. A channel is the actual link between your bot (the connector) and a specific service like Messenger, Slack or Kik. One connector can have multiple channels.

## How it works

There are two distinct flows:
* your bot receives a message from a channel
* your bot sends a message to a channel

This pipeline allows us to have an abstraction of messages independent of the platform and implement only a few functions for each messaging platform (input and output parsing).

#### Receive a message

The Bot Connector posts on the endpoint stored with the connector each time a new message arrives from a channel.
* a new message is received by Bot Connector
* the message is parsed by the corresponding service
* the message is saved in MongoDB
* the message is post to the bot endpoint

![BotConnector-Receive](https://cdn.cai.tools.sap/bot-connector/flow-1.png)

#### Post a message

To send a new message, you have to post it to Bot Connector's API
* the messages are saved in MongoDB
* the messages are formatted by the corresponding service to match the channel's format
* the messages are sent by Bot Connector to the corresponding channel

![BotConnector-Sending](https://cdn.cai.tools.sap/bot-connector/flow-2.png)

## Messages format

All messages coming from the bot are parsed and modified to match the destination channel specifications.
Bot Connector supports several message formats:

* Text

```js
{
  type: 'text',
  content: 'MY_TEXT',
}
```

* Picture

```js
{
  type: 'picture',
  content: 'IMAGE_URL',

568,568,lorcalhost/BTB-manager-telegram,Python,"# Binance Trade Bot Manager Telegram

A Telegram bot for remotely managing Edendg23's [Binance Trade Bot](https://github.com/edeng23/binance-trade-bot) and its forks.

This program aims to be an easy way of managing Binance Trade Bot] so that I wouldn't have to constantly ssh into my VPS, and my non-techy friends could enjoy the benefits of automated trading.

The program's default behavior fetches Telegram `token` and `chat_id` from [Binance Trade Bot]'s `apprise.yml` file. For a quick Telegram bot setup guide [click here](./docs/telegram-setup.md).

## Installation
### Docker install
For a Docker setup guide [click here](./docs/docker-setup.md).

### Manual install
**Python 3.7, 3.8 or 3.9** is required.
**BTB-manager-telegram** should be installed in the same parent directory as **Binance Trade Bot**. Your filesystem should look like this:

```
PARENT_DIR
  ├── BTB-manager-telegram
  └── binance-trade-bot
```

To begin with, open a terminal and place yourself in the directory where the binance-trade-bot is already present, e.g. if the binance_trade_bot directory is located in `/home/user/trading_bot` run:
```console
cd /home/user/trading_bot
```
Then, run the following lines:
```console
git clone https://github.com/lorcalhost/BTB-manager-telegram.git
cd BTB-manager-telegram
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

As the telegram bot is launching itself the **Binance Trade Bot**, you only have to start the **BTB Manager Telegram** like so:

```console
python3 -m btb_manager_telegram
```

If the bot is running on a server you may want to keep it running even after ssh connection is closed by using nohup. Note the trailing ""&"" :
```console
nohup python3 -m btb_manager_telegram &
```

However, you can run the bot with options :
```console
# Autostart the Binance Trade Bot when the BTB Manager starts
# (Otherwise you will have to manually start the Binance Trade Bot from telegram)
python3 -m btb_manager_telegram -s

# Use the french translation. Available translation : en, ru, fr, de, nl, es, id, cn
python3 -m btb_manager_telegram -l fr

# Make possible to plot the bot's performance in EUR instead of USD
python3 -m btb_manager_telegram -u EUR

# If using other currencies than USD or EUR, for example GBP, you will have to provide
# an openexchangerates API key, see the flag --oer_key.
# Get you key here : https://openexchangerates.org/signup/free
python3 -m btb_manager_telegram -u GBP -o OPENEXCHANGERATES_KEY

# Of course you can combine all of this!
python3 -m btb_manager_telegram -s -l fr -u EUR

# Using nohup with options
nohup python3 -m btb_manager_telegram -s -l fr -u EUR &

# See all available options
python3 -m btb_manager_telegram --help
```

## Stopping the bot
If the trade bot has been launched with the telegram bot, stopping the telegram bot will stop the trade bot.

- If the telegram bot has been launched **without** `nohup`, closing the terminal or pressing `CTRL + C` will stop the bot.

- If the telegram bot has been launched **with** `nohup`, the bot can be stopped with the command `kill $(cat btbmt.pid)` (no animal will be hurt in this operation). If this command respond the file `btbmt.pid`, it his very likely the telegram bot is no longer running.

## Manual upgrade
First of, stop the telegram bot.
```console
git pull
python3 -m pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
```
You can now reboot the telegram bot.

## Additional notes

### Custom scripts
This bot supports custom scripts in a plugin manner. An extensive documentation on customs scripts is available [here](./docs/custom-scripts.md).

### Telegram token and chat_id
Make sure that **Binance Trade Bot**'s `config/apprise.yml` file is correctly setup before running, the telegram manager retreives this file to connect the bot.

If **Binance Trade Bot** and **BTB-Manager-Telegram** were **not** installed in the same parent directory or if `apprise.yml` is not setup or you want to use different `token` and `chat_id` from the ones in the `apprise.yml` file, you can set these two keys with the options `--token` and `--chat_id`

### Virtualenvs
If the Binance Trade Bot has its own python environment, that is not shared with the telegram manager, you have to specify the path of the python binary used by the trade bot with the option `--python_path`. For example, if you created a virtualenv specific to the binance trade bot in the folder `/home/user/trading_bot/binance-trade-bot/venv`, you have to run the telegram bot like so:
```console
python3 -m btb_manager_telegram --python_path /home/user/trading_bot/binance-trade-bot/venv/bin/python
```

### Multiple bots
If you would like to run several **Binance Trade Bot** instances at the same time [click here](./docs/multiple-bots.md).

### Compatibility
This program is fully compatible with **Linux** and **Windows** through **WSL** (*Windows Subsystem for Linux*).  

Severa known problems are present on **native Windows** and will not be asserted.

**MacOS** compatibility is unknown, but supposed to be good ad this system is close to **Linux**.

# 安装

Docker 部署命令：

~~评论区反馈docker不支持arm架构，推测原因为原docker为amd64架构,目前只在amd64上测试成功~~
目前理论支持所含架构，具体没有进行真机测试

```
docker run -d \
    --name arpt \
    -e Api_hash=xxx \
    -e Api_id=xxx \
    -e Aria2_secret=xxx \
    -e Remote=yun \
    -e Telegram_bot_api=xxx \
    -e Telegram_user_id=xxx \
    -e Upload=xxx \
    -e Rclone_share=False \
    -e Error_user_info=""你没有使用权限"" \
    -p 8868:8868 \
   benchao/arpt:v2.0.8

```

配置解释

```
Api_hash Api_id 这两项在https://my.telegram.org中注册应用后得到

Aria2_secret    Aria2的密匙

Telegram_bot_api    Bot的API，在@BotFather申请获得

Telegram_user_id    使用者的TG id，可在@userinfobot处获得，设置为群组ID则该群组所有人员可用，需要设置Bot的群组权限

Remote  上传目的地的rclone盘符

Upload  上传文件夹名称，后面不需要加/

Rclone_share 可不填，True 为上传网盘后返回分享链接(onedrive)，False 为关闭该功能，不设置该变量则默认关闭

Error_user_info 可不填，可设置非允许使用者发送消息时的提示，不设置该变量则使用默认语句

```

在Docker运行后访问ip:port访问文件管理器，~~在/.config/rclone下文件夹新建rclone.conf,粘贴自己的rclone配置。~~
PS:有人反馈此处配置不成功，可尝试在/root/.config/rclone也添加配置，bot运行 **/rclone 盘符:** ，可以查看是否成功
关于上传方法，将.conf文件拖入浏览器即可。

![成功效果](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/666wcy/img_share@main/img/image.2abs656qyrb4.png)

Docker目前不支持自动更新，目前更新需要自行重装新镜像版本

可自行查看最新镜像版本号：[查看地址](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/benchao/arpt)

# 杂项说明

关于在面板配置Aria2的设置，ip为vps端口，端口为docker设定的端口
举例,若docker中命令为
`-p 8868:8868 \`
则端口为8868
面板密钥填docker创建时你的Aria2_secret值

## Two Versions of the Blocker ? PLEASE TAKE NOTE :exclamation:

:exclamation:**There are now two distinctly different versions of this blocker.**:exclamation:

**<a href=""https://github.com/mitchellkrogza/apache-ultimate-bad-bot-blocker/tree/master/Apache_2.2"">Apache 2.2 > 2.4+ (access_compat)</a>  [  TESTED ON APACHE 2.2 > 2.4.27  ]**
****************************************************************
```
A Version for Apache 2.2 > 2.4 + which requires the module access_compat and uses the older 
Order Allow,Deny Access Control Methods. 

This is the ORIGINAL VERSION of the blocker and is now located in the folder Apache_2.2 at:
https://github.com/mitchellkrogza/apache-ultimate-bad-bot-blocker/tree/master/Apache_2.2
```
****************************************************************

**<a href=""https://github.com/mitchellkrogza/apache-ultimate-bad-bot-blocker/tree/master/Apache_2.4"">Apache 2.4+ ONLY</a>  [  TESTED ON APACHE 2.4 > 2.4.34  ]**
****************************************************************
``` 
A new version for Apache 2.4+ only which uses new the Access Control Structures of 
<RequireAll> and <RequireAny>. 

Anyone using Apache 2.4 should be using this new version as it fully complies with the new Access 
Control Methods of Apache and does not require the access_compat module to be loaded. 

This new version is at: 
https://github.com/mitchellkrogza/apache-ultimate-bad-bot-blocker/tree/master/Apache_2.4
```
****************************************************************

************************************************
<img src=""https://github.com/mitchellkrogza/apache-ultimate-bad-bot-blocker/blob/master/.assets/step-1.png""/>

**COPY THE GLOBALBLACKLIST.CONF FILE FROM THE REPO**
$APACHE_CONF is generally located at /etc/apache2 or /etc/httpd depending on OS

Copy the contents of **globalblacklist.conf** into your $APACHE_CONF/custom.d folder. 
e.g. /etc/apache2/custom.d on Ubuntu/Debian
     /etc/httpd on RHEL/centos
**You need to create this folder.**

The following directions use /etc/apache2 as an example.

`sudo mkdir /etc/apache2/custom.d`

`sudo wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mitchellkrogza/apache-ultimate-bad-bot-blocker/master/Apache_2.2/custom.d/globalblacklist.conf -O /etc/apache2/custom.d/globalblacklist.conf`

If your Linux distribution does not have wget you can replace the wget commands using curl as follows:

`curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mitchellkrogza/apache-ultimate-bad-bot-blocker/master/Apache_2.2/custom.d/globalblacklist.conf -o /etc/apache2/custom.d/globalblacklist.conf`

************************************************
<img src=""https://github.com/mitchellkrogza/apache-ultimate-bad-bot-blocker/blob/master/.assets/step-2.png""/>

**WHITELIST ALL YOUR OWN DOMAIN NAMES AND IP ADDRESSES**

Whitelist all your own domain names and IP addresses. **Please note important changes**, this is now done using include files so that you do not have to keep reinserting your whitelisted domains and IP addresses every time you update.

:exclamation: :exclamation: :exclamation: WARNING: Please do NOT ever use 127.0.0.1 as a whitelisted IP address in whitelist-ips.conf it will cause the blocker to stop functioning.

- copy the whitelist-ips.conf file into that folder

`sudo wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mitchellkrogza/apache-ultimate-bad-bot-blocker/master/Apache_2.2/custom.d/whitelist-ips.conf -O /etc/apache2/custom.d/whitelist-ips.conf`


- copy the whitelist-domains.conf file into the same folder

`sudo wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mitchellkrogza/apache-ultimate-bad-bot-blocker/master/Apache_2.2/custom.d/whitelist-domains.conf -O /etc/apache2/custom.d/whitelist-domains.conf`

Use nano, vim or any other text editor to edit both whitelist-ips.conf and whitelist-domains.conf to include all your own domain names and IP addresses that you want to specifically whitelist from the blocker script. 

When pulling any future updates now you can simply pull the latest globalblacklist.conf file and it will automatically include your whitelisted domains and IP addresses. No more remembering having to do this yourself.

************************************************
<img src=""https://github.com/mitchellkrogza/apache-ultimate-bad-bot-blocker/blob/master/.assets/step-3.png""/>

**DOWNLOAD CUSTOM BLACKLIST INCLUDE FILE FOR IP ADDRESS AND IP RANGE BLOCKING**

Blacklist any IP addresses or Ranges you wish to keep out of your servers. **Please note important changes**, this is now done using include files so that you have full control over what IP addresses and IP Ranges and blocked from your Apache Server.

- copy the blacklist-ips.conf file into that folder

`sudo wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mitchellkrogza/apache-ultimate-bad-bot-blocker/master/Apache_2.2/custom.d/blacklist-ips.conf -O /etc/apache2/custom.d/blacklist-ips.conf`


Use nano, vim or any other text editor to edit the blacklist-ips.conf file as you like. 

When pulling any future updates now your custom IP blacklist will not be overwritten.

************************************************
<img src=""https://github.com/mitchellkrogza/apache-ultimate-bad-bot-blocker/blob/master/.assets/step-4.png""/>

**DOWNLOAD CUSTOM BAD REFERRER WORDS INCLUDE FILE FOR CUSTOMIZED SCANNING OF BAD WORDS**

Scan for any bad referrer words you wish to keep out of your servers. **Please note important changes**, this is now done using include files so that you have full control over what IP addresses and IP Ranges and blocked from your Apache Server.

- copy the bad-referrer-words.conf file into that folder

`sudo wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mitchellkrogza/apache-ultimate-bad-bot-blocker/master/Apache_2.2/custom.d/bad-referrer-words.conf -O /etc/apache2/custom.d/bad-referrer-words.conf`


Use nano, vim or any other text editor to edit the bad-referrer-words.conf file as you like. 

When pulling any future updates now your custom bad referrer words list will not be overwritten.

************************************************
<img src=""https://github.com/mitchellkrogza/apache-ultimate-bad-bot-blocker/blob/master/.assets/step-5.png""/>

**DOWNLOAD CUSTOM BLACKLIST USER-AGENTS INCLUDE FILE FOR CUSTOMIZED BLOCKING OF USER AGENTS**

Allows you to add your own custom list of user agents with this new include file.

- copy the blacklist-user-agents.conf file into that folder

`sudo wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mitchellkrogza/apache-ultimate-bad-bot-blocker/master/Apache_2.2/custom.d/blacklist-user-agents.conf -O /etc/apache2/custom.d/blacklist-user-agents.conf`

**NOTE:** On the Apache Blocker if you want to over-ride any of the whitelisted bots you can add them to this include file and the previously whitelisted bots in the blocker will be over-ridden by this include file. So let's say for some ""obscure"" reason you really do not want any search engines like Googlebot or Bingbot to ever access or index your site, you add them to your blacklist-user-agents.conf and they will be over-ridden from the earlier whitelisting in the blocker. This now gives users total control over the blocker without every having to try and modify the globalblacklist.conf file. So now you can customize all your include files and you can still pull the daily updates of globalblacklist.conf and it will not touch any of your custom include files.

************************************************
<img src=""https://github.com/mitchellkrogza/apache-ultimate-bad-bot-blocker/blob/master/.assets/step-6.png""/>

**INCLUDE THE GLOBALBLACKLIST.CONF**

Include the globalblacklist.conf file in the beginning of a directory block just after your opening Options statements and before the rest of your host config example below. **Remove the ""<<<<<< This needs to be added"" part**

```
<VirtualHost *:80>
	ServerName local.dev
	DocumentRoot /var/www/html
	ErrorLog /tmp/error.log

	<Directory ""/var/www/html"">
	Options +Includes
	Options +FollowSymLinks -Indexes
	Include custom.d/globalblacklist.conf
	</Directory>
</VirtualHost>
```

You can include globalblacklist.conf globally (for all virtual hosts) if you put the following configuration after virtual host configuration.

```
# ######################################
# GLOBAL! deny bad bots and IP addresses
# ######################################
#
# should be set after <VirtualHost>s see https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/sections.html#merging
<Location ""/"">
	# AND-combine with preceding configuration sections  
	AuthMerging And
	# include black list
	Include custom.d/globalblacklist.conf
</Location>
```

************************************************
<img src=""https://github.com/mitchellkrogza/apache-ultimate-bad-bot-blocker/blob/master/.assets/step-7.png""/>

**TEST YOUR APACHE CONFIGURATION**

Do an Apache2 Config Test

`sudo apache2ctl configtest`

If you get no errors then you followed my instructions so now you can make the blocker go live with a simple.

`sudo service apache2 reload`

or

`sudo service httpd reload`

The blocker is now active and working so now you can run some simple tests from another linux machine to make sure it's working.

************************************************
<img src=""https://github.com/mitchellkrogza/apache-ultimate-bad-bot-blocker/blob/master/.assets/step-8.png""/>

*TESTING**

Run the following commands one by one from a terminal on another linux machine against your own domain name. 
**substitute yourdomain.com in the examples below with your REAL domain name**

`curl -A ""googlebot"" http://yourdomain.com`

Should respond with 200 OK

`curl -A ""80legs"" http://yourdomain.com`

`curl -A ""masscan"" http://yourdomain.com`

Should respond with 403 Forbidden

`curl -I http://yourdomain.com -e http://100dollars-seo.com`

`curl -I http://yourdomain.com -e http://zx6.ru`

Should respond with 403 Forbidden

The Apache Ultimate Bot Blocker is now WORKING and PROTECTING your web sites !!!

************************************************

**UPDATING THE APACHE BAD BOT BLOCKER** is now easy thanks to the automatic includes for whitelisting your own domain names.

Updating to the latest version is now as simple as:

`sudo wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mitchellkrogza/apache-ultimate-bad-bot-blocker/master/Apache_2.2/custom.d/globalblacklist.conf -O /etc/apache2/custom.d/globalblacklist.conf`

### No root access to your Apache server and Unable to run this blocker?

Version 2.2017.03 introduced .htaccess versions of the spam referrer for those unable to run the full Apache Bad Bot Blocker look inside the https://github.com/mitchellkrogza/apache-ultimate-bad-bot-blocker/tree/master/_htaccess_versions folder in this repo for instructions.

Bots attempt to make themselves look like other software or web sites by disguising their user agent. 
Their user agent names may look harmless, perfectly legitimate even. 

For example, ""^Java"" but according to Project Honeypot, it's actually one of the most dangerous BUT a lot of
legitimate bots out there have ""Java"" in their user agent string so the approach taken by many to block is 
not only ignorant but also blocking out very legitimate crawlers including some of Google's and Bing's.

# Welcome to the Ultimate Bad Bot and Referer Blocker for Apache Web Server 2.4.x

************************************************
### THE METHOD IN MY MADNESS

This bot blocker list is designed to be an Apache include file and uses the apache
BrowserMatchNoCase directive. This way the .conf file can be loaded 
once into memory by Apache and be available to all web sites that you operate.
You simply need to use an Include statement (example below)

I personally find the BrowserMatchNoCase Directive to be more accurate than using 
SetEnvIfNoCase User-Agent because BrowserMatchNoCase is not case sensitive and
from my tests is more accurate that SetEnvIfNoCase.

My method also results in a cleaner file to maintain that requires no complex regex
other than the Name of the Bot. BrowserMatchNoCase will do the rest. You can use Regex
if you like but it's NOT needed and I proved it by testing with the Chrome extension
User-Agent Switcher for Chrome. 

- The user agent ""Aboundex"" is found without using ""^Aboundex"" ... much simpler for anyone 
to maintain than other lists using Regex.

- Likewise it is unnecessary to have ""Download\ Demon"" instead you now just have
""Download Demon"". 

- Additionally if we have a rule, like below ""Image Stripper"" and a bot
decides to change its User-Agent string to ""NOT Image Stripper I Promise"" he is picked
up regardless and blocked immediately. 

I only capitalise bot names in my list for ease of reading and maintenance, remember its 
not case-sensitive so will catch any combination like ""Bot"" ""bOt"" and ""bOT"".

So for those of you who SUCK with Regex my Apache Bad Bot Blocker is your saviour !!!

************************************************
### IT'S CENTRALISED:

The beauty of this is that it is one central file used by all your web sites.
This means there is only place to make amendments ie. adding new bots that you
discover in your log files. Any changes are applied immediately to all sites after
a simple ""sudo service apache2 reload"". 

************************************************
### IT IS TINY AND LIGHTWEIGHT

The file is tiny in size. At the time of this writing and the first public commit of this
the file size including all the commenting ""which Apache ignores"" is a mere 212 kb in size.
It is so lightweight that Apache does not even know it's there. It already contains thousands
of entries.

************************************************
### NO COMPLICATED REWRITE RULES:

This also does not use ReWrite Rules and Conditions which also put overhead onto
Apache, this sends a simple 403 Forbidden Response and DONE !!!

************************************************
### APACHE WILL LOVE YOU FOR IT !!!!

This approach also makes this very lightweight on Apache versus the usual .htaccess
approach that many choose. The .htaccess approach is a little clumsy because every site
has to have its own one and every time someone requests your web site the .htaccess gets
hit and has to be checked, this is unnecessary overhead for Apache and not to mention
a pain when it comes to maintenance and updating your ruleset.

.htaccess just sucks full stop. One reason after 9 years I have moved everything to
Nginx but will continue to keep this file updated as it is solid and it works.

************************************************
## FEATURES OF THE APACHE ULTIMATE BAD BOT BLOCKER:

- Extensive Lists of Bad and Known Bad Bots and Scrapers (updated almost daily)
- Blocking of Spam Referrer Domains and Web Sites
- Blocking of SEO data collection companies like Semalt.com, Builtwith.com, WooRank.com and many others (updated regularly)
- Blocking of clickjacking Sites linked to Adware, Malware and Ransomware
- Blocking of Porn and Gambling Web Sites who use Lucrative Ways to Earn Money through Serving Ads by hopping off your domain names and web sites.
- Blocking of Bad Domains and IP's that you cannot even see in your Nginx Logs. Thanks to the Content Security Policy (CSP) on all my SSL sites I can see things trying to pull resources off my sites before they even get to Nginx and get blocked by the CSP.
- Anti DDOS Filter and Rate Limiting of Agressive Bots
- Alphabetically ordered for easier maintenance (Pull Requests Welcomed)
- Commented sections of certain important bots to be sure of before blocking
- Includes the IP range of Cyveillance who are known to ignore robots.txt rules
  and snoop around all over the Internet.
- Whitelisting of Google, Bing and Cloudflare IP Ranges
- Whitelisting of your own IP Ranges that you want to avoid blocking by mistake.
- Ability to add other IP ranges and IP blocks that you want to block out.
- If its out there and it's bad it's already in here and BLOCKED !!

************************************************
### UNDERSTANDS PUNYCODE / IDN DOMAIN NAMES
A lot of lists out there put funny domains into their hosts file. Your hosts file and DNS will not understand this. This list uses converted domains which are in the correct DNS format to be understood by any operating system. **Avoid using lists** that do not put the correctly formatted domain structure into their lists.

For instance
The domain:

`lifehacĸer.com` (note the K)

actually translates to:

`xn--lifehacer-1rb.com`

You can do an nslookup on any operating system and it will resolve correctly.

`nslookup xn--lifehacer-1rb.com`

```xn--lifehacer-1rb.com
	origin = dns1.yandex.net
	mail addr = iskalko.yandex.ru
	serial = 2016120703
	refresh = 14400
	retry = 900
	expire = 1209600
	minimum = 14400
xn--lifehacer-1rb.com	mail exchanger = 10 mx.yandex.net.
Name:	xn--lifehacer-1rb.com
Address: 78.110.60.230
xn--lifehacer-1rb.com	nameserver = dns2.yandex.net.
xn--lifehacer-1rb.com	text = ""v=spf1 redirect=_spf.yandex.net""
xn--lifehacer-1rb.com	nameserver = dns1.yandex.net.
```

************************************************
## WARNING:

 Please understand why you are using the Apache Bad Bot Blocker before you even use this.
 Please do not simply copy and paste without understanding what this is doing.
 Do not become a copy and paste Linux ""Guru"", learn things properly before you use them
 and always test everything you do one step at a time.

************************************************
## MONITOR WHAT YOU ARE DOING:

 MAKE SURE to monitor your web site logs after implementing this. I suggest you first
 load this into one site and monitor it for any possible false positives before putting
 this into production on all your web sites.
 
 Also monitor your logs daily for new bad referers and user-agent strings that you
 want to block. Your best source of adding to this list is your own server logs, not mine.

************************************************
## HOW TO MONITOR YOUR APACHE LOGS DAILY (The Easy Way):

With great thanks and appreciation to https://blog.nexcess.net/2011/01/21/one-liners-for-apache-log-files/

To monitor your top referer's for a web site's log file's on a daily basis use the following simple
cron jobs which will email you a list of top referer's / user agents every morning from a particular web site's log
files. This is an example for just one cron job for one site. Set up multiple one's for each one you
want to monitor. Here is a cron that runs at 8am every morning and emails me the stripped down log of
referers. When I say stripped down, the domain of the site and other referers like Google and Bing are
stripped from the results. Of course you must change the log file name, domain name and your email address in
the examples below. The second cron for collecting User agents does not do any stripping out of any referers but you
can add that functionality if you like copying the awk statement !~ from the first example.

##### Cron for Monitoring Daily Referers on Apache

`00 08 * * * tail -10000 /var/log/apache/mydomain-access.log | awk '$11 !~ /google|bing|yahoo|yandex|mywebsite.com/' | awk '{print $11}' | tr -d '""' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head -1000 | mail -s ""Top 1000 Referers for Mydomain.com"" me@mydomain.com`

##### Cron for Monitoring Daily User Agents on Apache

`00 08 * * * tail -50000 /var/log/apache/mydomain-access.log | awk '{print $12}' | tr -d '""' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head -1000 | mail -s ""Top 1000 Agents for Mydomain.com"" me@mydomain.com`

# EASY CONFIGURATION INSTRUCTIONS FOR STOPPING GOOGLE ANALYTICS ""GHOST"" SPAM

Simply using the Apache blocker does not stop Google Analytics ghost referral spam because they are hitting Analytics directly and not always necessarily touching your website. 

You should use regex filters in Analytics to prevent ghost referral spam.

For this there are several google-exclude-0*.txt files which have been created for you and they are updated at the same time when the Nginx Blocker is updated. As the list grows there will be more exclude files created.

## To stop Ghost Spam on On Analytics

Follow the step by step visual instructions below to add these google-exclude files as segments to your web site.

## Blocking Spam Referrer Domains Using Google Webmaster Tools (How to use google-disavow.txt file)

I have added the creation of a Google Disavow text file called google-disavow.txt. This file can be used in Google's Webmaster Tools to block all these domains out as spammy or bad links. Use with caution.

************************************************
## Blocking Agressive Bots at Firewall Level Using Fail2Ban

I have added a custom Fail2Ban filter and action that I have written which monitors your Apache logs for bots that generate
a large number of 403 errors. This custom jail for Fail2Ban will scan logs over a 1 week period and ban the offender for 24 hours.
It helps a great deal in keeping out some repeat offenders and preventing them from filling up your log files with 403 errors.
See the Fail2Ban folder for instructions on configuring this great add on for the Apache Bad Bot Blocker.

572,572,szastupov/musicbot,Python,"Music Catalog Bot
=================

This Telegram bot maintains a user generated catalog of music.

How does it work? You simply send audio file (from Telegram Desktop, Web or OSX) to the bot and it's added to the public catalog. All tracks are indexed and available for everyone from any Telegram client.

![Screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/vRNxnDS.png)
![Screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/qmvht6v.png)

### Technical side

The bot doesn't store any media, instead it only keeps track metadata, while the files are hosted on Telegram servers.

It's written in Python 3, powered by [aiotg](https://github.com/szastupov/aiotg) framework and uses [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com) for index.

You can easily run your own instance with [docker-compose](1):
```yml
musicbot:
  image: szastupov/musicbot
  restart: always
  links:
    - mongo
  environment:
    - BOT_NAME=MusicCatalogBot
    - API_TOKEN=Telegram API token
    - BOTAN_TOKEN=Optional botan token
    - MONGO_HOST=mongo
mongo:
  image: mongo
  restart: always
```

Or directly with docker:
```
$ docker pull szastupov/musicbot
$ docker run -e ""API_TOKEN=YOUR_TOKEN"" \
             -e ""BOT_NAME=BotPlaygroundBot"" \
             -e ""MONGO_HOST=mongo"" \
             --link mongo:mongo \
             szastupov/musicbot
```

Or you can run it manually, the requirements are specified in requirements.txt, you know the rest.

## 📃 About the project

With the Discord Dashboard, you are able to track and monitor keen information of your bot 
to ensure the best quality for your users. Things like, which commands were most used and how 
many users are utilizing your bot. 

The dashboard also offers you to have your own customizable logging for tracking down bugs and
finding where you can improve.

You'll also have the ability to monitor system data and see how much RAM your bot uses alongside plenty more features waiting to be used:

- Online user statistics
- Server statistics
- Command usage (Most used, Least used and Arguments used)
- System data (CPU, GPU and RAM usage)
- Customizable logging system
- Hourly usage of bot commands
- More to come in the future...

All these statistics will be analyzed in a user friendly way that will allow you to see where an issue may occure.

In the future, you'll be able to change the presence data without having the need
of doing hard changes on the codebase.


## 🖥️ Using the dashboard

574,574,bufferapp/AdaptableBottomNavigation,Java,"Simple Bottom Navigation
-------------------------

<p align=""center"">

# Motivation

When using a TabLayout within your application, using a ViewPager along with an adapter offers an easy way to quickly link up your views for display. The FragmentAdapter class takes care of all the hard work for you when it comes to switching between the views as the user selected a different item in the TabLayout. This process is made up something a little like this:

<p align=""center"">
<img src=""/art/view_pager.png"">
</p>

This is great as it allows you to decouple this presentation logic from your activities or other classes. However, when it comes to implementing the BottomNavigationView from the design support library, we're not blessed with the same niceties. This requires your activity (or fragment) that is hosting the BottomNavigationView to house the logic used for the handling of such events. We can't use the ViewPager for Bottom Navigation as the way the view works breaks the design guidelines - so we created this library here to allow you to easily create an adapter for use with Bottom Navigation so that you can work with the view in a way in which you are familiar with when it comes to the ViewPager. This setup looks a little like this:

<p align=""center"">
<img src=""/art/view_swapper.png"">
</p>

# So, what is this library?

As mentioned, when using the Bottom Navigation View from the Android Support Library, there can be a lot of boilerplate code for the switching of views. Because of this, we took inspiration from the TabLayout setupWithViewPager() method and created a custom ViewSwapper component that can be attached to a Bottom Navigation View to simplify the management of view display. Within this library are three core components that you'll need to use:

- **AdaptableBottomNavigationView** - The Bottom Navigation View for displaying navigation items in a bar at the bottom of the screen.  This view extends the BottomNavigationView from the Design Support Library, so the two classes are easily interchangable in your projects.

- **ViewSwapper** - The View Swapper is used to easily switch between fragments that you wish to display to the user. Unlike the View pager, views will not transition between pages and swiping is not possible - hence adhering to the Design Principles for the Bottom Navigation View. This view is essentially a tweaked version of the ViewPager component that you're probably familiar with already!

- **FragmentStateAdapter / FragmentAdapter** - An abstract adapter that allows you to create an adapter for displaying fragments within the ViewSwapper. These classes are the same as the implementations found within the Android Framework, agan with a few tweaks to better match the behaviour of the View Swapper component.

# But how's it different from using a ViewPager?

In the library you'll notice the ViewSwapper component. This is similar to the ViewPager except it has a view differences:

- Unlike the viewpager, it doesn't draw all views within the component at once. The Views are simply added and removed as the item to be displayed has been selected

- The ViewSwapper *doesn't* allow swiping between views - this allows us to adhere to the guidelines for not allowing the Bottom Navigation to be interacted with in this way

# How to use

In order to use this ViewSwapper component you need to use our SimpleBottomNavigationView - this is simply an extension of the support library component with the added functionality of ViewSwapper attachment and elevation. This will look like so in your layout file:

```xml
<org.buffer.adaptablebottomnavigation.view.ViewSwapper
    android:id=""@+id/view_swapper""
    android:layout_width=""match_parent""
    android:layout_height=""match_parent""
    android:layout_above=""@+id/view_bottom_navigation"" />

<org.buffer.adaptablebottomnavigation.AdaptableBottomNavigationView

    android:layout_width=""match_parent""
    android:layout_height=""wrap_content""

    android:background=""@color/colorPrimary""

    app:itemIconTint=""@drawable/selector_menu""
    app:itemTextColor=""@drawable/selector_menu""
    app:menu=""@menu/main"" />
```

Next, you'll need to create an adapter using either the FragmentStateAdapter or FragmentAdapter classes from the library. These are the essentially the same as the corresponding adapter classes found in the Android Framework. This could look something like so:

```java

public class ViewSwapperAdapter extends FragmentStateAdapter {

    private static final int INDEX_BUFFER = 0;
    private static final int INDEX_RETREAT = 1;
    private static final int INDEX_VALUES = 2;

    public ViewSwapperAdapter(FragmentManager fm) {
        super(fm);
    }

    @Override
    public Fragment getItem(int position) {
        switch (position) {
            case INDEX_BUFFER:
                return ImageFragment.newInstance(R.drawable.cat);
            case INDEX_RETREAT:
                return ImageFragment.newInstance(R.drawable.buffer);
            case INDEX_VALUES:
                return ImageFragment.newInstance(R.drawable.android);
        }
        return ImageFragment.newInstance(R.drawable.cat);
    }

    @Override
    public int getCount() {
        return 3;
    }

}
```

Now we have the views defined in our layout and the adapter to manage the display of our fragments (or views), we can go ahead and set the adapter for the View Swapper followed by attaching the View Swapper to the Bottom Navigation View:

e.g.
```java
viewSwapper.setAdapter(viewSwapperAdapter);
bottomNavigationView.setupWithViewSwapper(viewSwapper);
```

A personal bot that runs on Discord.

## Running

I would prefer if you don't run an instance of my bot. Just call the join command with an invite URL to have it on your server. The source here is provided for educational purposes for discord.py.

Nevertheless, the installation steps are as follows:

1. **Make sure to get Python 3.8 or higher**

This is required to actually run the bot.

2. **Set up venv**

Just do `python3.8 -m venv venv`

3. **Install dependencies**

This is `pip install -U -r requirements.txt`

4. **Create the database in PostgreSQL**

You will need PostgreSQL 9.5 or higher and type the following
in the `psql` tool:

```sql
CREATE ROLE rdanny WITH LOGIN PASSWORD 'yourpw';
CREATE DATABASE rdanny OWNER rdanny;
CREATE EXTENSION pg_trgm;
```

5. **Setup configuration**

The next step is just to create a `config.py` file in the root directory where
the bot is with the following template:

```py
client_id   = '' # your bot's client ID
token = '' # your bot's token
carbon_key = '' # your bot's key on carbon's site
bots_key = '' # your key on bots.discord.pw
postgresql = 'postgresql://user:password@host/database' # your postgresql info from above
challonge_api_key = '...' # for tournament cog
stat_webhook = ('<webhook_id>','<webhook_token>') # a webhook to a channel for bot stats. 
# when you generate your webhook, take the token and ID from the URL like so: 
# https://discord.com/api/webhooks/<id>/<token>
```

6. **Configuration of database**

To configure the PostgreSQL database for use by the bot, go to the directory where `launcher.py` is located, and run the script by doing `python3.8 launcher.py db init`

A simple Python module to bypass Cloudflare's anti-bot page (also known as ""I'm Under Attack Mode"", or IUAM), implemented with [Requests](https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests). Cloudflare changes their techniques periodically, so I will update this repo frequently.

This can be useful if you wish to scrape or crawl a website protected with Cloudflare. Cloudflare's anti-bot page currently just checks if the client supports Javascript, though they may add additional techniques in the future.

Due to Cloudflare continually changing and hardening their protection page, cloudscraper requires a JavaScript Engine/interpreter to solve Javascript challenges. This allows the script to easily impersonate a regular web browser without explicitly deobfuscating and parsing Cloudflare's Javascript.

For reference, this is the default message Cloudflare uses for these sorts of pages:

```
Checking your browser before accessing website.com.

This process is automatic. Your browser will redirect to your requested content shortly.

Please allow up to 5 seconds...
```

Any script using cloudscraper will sleep for ~5 seconds for the first visit to any site with Cloudflare anti-bots enabled, though no delay will occur after the first request.

# Installation

Simply run `pip install cloudscraper`. The PyPI package is at https://pypi.python.org/pypi/cloudscraper/

Alternatively, clone this repository and run `python setup.py install`.

# Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- **[Requests](https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests)** >= 2.9.2
- **[requests_toolbelt](https://pypi.org/project/requests-toolbelt/)** >= 0.9.1

`python setup.py install` will install the Python dependencies automatically. The javascript interpreters and/or engines you decide to use are the only things you need to install yourself, excluding js2py which is part of the requirements as the default.

# Javascript Interpreters and Engines

We support the following Javascript interpreters/engines.

- **[ChakraCore](https://github.com/microsoft/ChakraCore):** Library binaries can also be located [here](https://www.github.com/VeNoMouS/cloudscraper/tree/ChakraCore/).
- **[js2py](https://github.com/PiotrDabkowski/Js2Py):** >=0.67
- **native**: Self made native python solver **(Default)**

- **[V8](https://github.com/sony/v8eval/):** We use Sony's [v8eval](https://v8.dev)() python module.

# Updates

Cloudflare modifies their anti-bot protection page occasionally, So far it has changed maybe once per year on average.

If you notice that the anti-bot page has changed, or if this module suddenly stops working, please create a GitHub issue so that I can update the code accordingly.

- Many issues are a result of users not updating to the latest release of this project. Before filing an issue, please run the following command:

```
pip show cloudscraper
```

If the value of the version field is not the latest release, please run the following to update your package:

```
pip install cloudscraper -U
```

If you are still encountering a problem, open an issue and please include:

- The full exception and stack trace.
- The URL of the Cloudflare-protected page which the script does not work on.
- A Pastebin or Gist containing the HTML source of the protected page.
- The version number from `pip show cloudscraper`.

# Usage

The simplest way to use cloudscraper is by calling `create_scraper()`.

```python
import cloudscraper

scraper = cloudscraper.create_scraper()  # returns a CloudScraper instance
# Or: scraper = cloudscraper.CloudScraper()  # CloudScraper inherits from requests.Session
print(scraper.get(""http://somesite.com"").text)  # => ""<!DOCTYPE html><html><head>...""
```

That's it...

Any requests made from this session object to websites protected by Cloudflare anti-bot will be handled automatically. Websites not using Cloudflare will be treated normally. You don't need to configure or call anything further, and you can effectively treat all websites as if they're not protected with anything.

You use cloudscraper exactly the same way you use Requests. `cloudScraper` works identically to a Requests `Session` object, just instead of calling `requests.get()` or `requests.post()`, you call `scraper.get()` or `scraper.post()`.

Consult [Requests' documentation](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/user/quickstart/) for more information.

## Integration

It's easy to integrate `cloudscraper` with other applications and tools. Cloudflare uses two cookies as tokens: one to verify you made it past their challenge page and one to track your session. To bypass the challenge page, simply include both of these cookies (with the appropriate user-agent) in all HTTP requests you make.

To retrieve just the cookies (as a dictionary), use `cloudscraper.get_tokens()`. To retrieve them as a full `Cookie` HTTP header, use `cloudscraper.get_cookie_string()`.

`get_tokens` and `get_cookie_string` both accept Requests' usual keyword arguments (like `get_tokens(url, proxies={""http"": ""socks5://localhost:9050""})`).

Please read [Requests' documentation on request arguments](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/api/#requests.Session.request) for more information.

------

### User-Agent Handling

The two integration functions return a tuple of `(cookie, user_agent_string)`.

**You must use the same user-agent string for obtaining tokens and for making requests with those tokens, otherwise Cloudflare will flag you as a bot.**

That means you have to pass the returned `user_agent_string` to whatever script, tool, or service you are passing the tokens to (e.g. curl, or a specialized scraping tool), and it must use that passed user-agent when it makes HTTP requests.

------

### Integration examples

Remember, you must always use the same user-agent when retrieving or using these cookies. These functions all return a tuple of `(cookie_dict, user_agent_string)`.

------

#### Retrieving a cookie dict through a proxy

`get_tokens` is a convenience function for returning a Python dict containing Cloudflare's session cookies. For demonstration, we will configure this request to use a proxy. (Please note that if you request Cloudflare clearance tokens through a proxy, you must always use the same proxy when those tokens are passed to the server. Cloudflare requires that the challenge-solving IP and the visitor IP stay the same.)

If you do not wish to use a proxy, just don't pass the `proxies` keyword argument. These convenience functions support all of Requests' normal keyword arguments, like `params`, `data`, and `headers`.

```python
import cloudscraper

proxies = {""http"": ""http://localhost:8080"", ""https"": ""http://localhost:8080""}
tokens, user_agent = cloudscraper.get_tokens(""http://somesite.com"", proxies=proxies)
print(tokens)
# => {
    'cf_clearance': 'c8f913c707b818b47aa328d81cab57c349b1eee5-1426733163-3600',
    '__cfduid': 'dd8ec03dfdbcb8c2ea63e920f1335c1001426733158'
}
```

------

#### Retrieving a cookie string

`get_cookie_string` is a convenience function for returning the tokens as a string for use as a `Cookie` HTTP header value.

This is useful when crafting an HTTP request manually, or working with an external application or library that passes on raw cookie headers.

```python
import cloudscraper

cookie_value, user_agent = cloudscraper.get_cookie_string('http://somesite.com')

print('GET / HTTP/1.1\nCookie: {}\nUser-Agent: {}\n'.format(cookie_value, user_agent))

# GET / HTTP/1.1
# Cookie: cf_clearance=c8f913c707b818b47aa328d81cab57c349b1eee5-1426733163-3600; __cfduid=dd8ec03dfdbcb8c2ea63e920f1335c1001426733158
# User-Agent: Some/User-Agent String
```

------

#### curl example

Here is an example of integrating cloudscraper with curl. As you can see, all you have to do is pass the cookies and user-agent to curl.

```python
import subprocess
import cloudscraper

# With get_tokens() cookie dict:

# tokens, user_agent = cloudscraper.get_tokens(""http://somesite.com"")
# cookie_arg = 'cf_clearance={}; __cfduid={}'.format(tokens['cf_clearance'], tokens['__cfduid'])

# With get_cookie_string() cookie header; recommended for curl and similar external applications:

cookie_arg, user_agent = cloudscraper.get_cookie_string('http://somesite.com')

# With a custom user-agent string you can optionally provide:

# ua = ""Scraping Bot""
# cookie_arg, user_agent = cloudscraper.get_cookie_string(""http://somesite.com"", user_agent=ua)

result = subprocess.check_output(
    [
        'curl',
        '--cookie',
        cookie_arg,
        '-A',
        user_agent,
        'http://somesite.com'
    ]
)
```

Trimmed down version. Prints page contents of any site protected with Cloudflare, via curl.

**Warning: `shell=True` can be dangerous to use with `subprocess` in real code.**

```python
url = ""http://somesite.com""
cookie_arg, user_agent = cloudscraper.get_cookie_string(url)
cmd = ""curl --cookie {cookie_arg} -A {user_agent} {url}""
print(
    subprocess.check_output(
        cmd.format(
            cookie_arg=cookie_arg,
            user_agent=user_agent,
            url=url
        ),
        shell=True
    )
)
```

## Other .Net SDK Packages (non-component)

The projects and packages contained within this section are available as traditional NuGet packages. i.e. they are not Bot Framework Components and can therefore not be used with Bot Framework Composer's Package Manager.

Over time we plan to make Components for each of these projects available and we will link to those components from each project as they become available.

## Usage

This library uses [""render props""](https://reactjs.org/docs/render-props.html) as established pattern for component composition. The example below illustrates the basic usage of the Bottom Navigation. All available Props are listed in the [Documentation](#documentation).

Dive into the example below, check out [the example app](/examples/Playground) and take a look at the [Usage Documentation](https://timomeh.gitbook.io/material-bottom-navigation/usage).

```js
import BottomNavigation, {
  FullTab
} from 'react-native-material-bottom-navigation'

export default class App extends React.Component {
  tabs = [
    {
      key: 'games',
      icon: 'gamepad-variant',
      label: 'Games',
      barColor: '#388E3C',
      pressColor: 'rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.16)'
    },
    {
      key: 'movies-tv',
      icon: 'movie',
      label: 'Movies & TV',
      barColor: '#B71C1C',
      pressColor: 'rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.16)'
    },
    {
      key: 'music',
      icon: 'music-note',
      label: 'Music',
      barColor: '#E64A19',
      pressColor: 'rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.16)'
    }
  ]

  state = {
    activeTab: 'games'
  }

  renderIcon = icon => ({ isActive }) => (
    <Icon size={24} color=""white"" name={icon} />
  )

  renderTab = ({ tab, isActive }) => (
    <FullTab
      isActive={isActive}
      key={tab.key}
      label={tab.label}
      renderIcon={this.renderIcon(tab.icon)}
    />
  )

  render() {
    return (
      <View style={{ flex: 1 }}>
        <View style={{ flex: 1 }}>
          {/* Your screen contents depending on current tab. */}
        </View>
        <BottomNavigation
          activeTab={this.state.activeTab}
          onTabPress={newTab => this.setState({ activeTab: newTab.key })}
          renderTab={this.renderTab}
          tabs={this.tabs}
        />
      </View>
    )
  }
}
```

**Note:** Out-of-the-box support for React Navigation (called `NavigationComponent` in earlier releases) was removed with v1. Check [this example](/examples/with-react-navigation.js) for a custom React Navigation integration. [Read more...](#react-navigation-support)

## Notes

### React Navigation Support

**Check [this example](/examples/with-react-navigation.js) for a custom React Navigation integration.**

In contrary to earlier releases, this library does not support React Navigation _out of the box_. React Navigation now ships with its own Material Bottom Navigation: [`createMaterialBottomTabNavigator`](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/en/material-bottom-tab-navigator.html).

You can still implement react-native-material-bottom-navigation manually by using React Navigation's [Custom Navigators](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/en/custom-navigators.html#api-for-building-custom-navigators). Check out [this example](/examples/with-react-navigation.js).

### Updated Material Design Specs

Google updated the Material Guidelines on Google I/O 2018 with new specifications, including a slightly changed Bottom Navigation and a new ""App Bar Bottom"" with a FAB in a centered cutout. react-native-material-bottom-navigation uses the _older_ specs.

[Bots] are special Telegram users controlled with an HTTP API. Botgram
aims to expose the capabilities of this API with a very clear and minimal
syntax, so you can create Telegram bots easily.

~~~ js
const botgram = require(""botgram"")
const bot = botgram(""<auth token>"")

bot.command(""start"", ""help"", (msg, reply) =>
  reply.text(""To schedule an alert, do: /alert <seconds> <text>""))

bot.command(""alert"", (msg, reply, next) => {
  var [ seconds, text ] = msg.args(2)
  if (!seconds.match(/^\d+$/) || !text) return next()

  setTimeout(() => reply.text(text), Number(seconds) * 1000)
})

bot.command((msg, reply) =>
  reply.text(""Invalid command.""))
~~~

### Features

 - Simple, intuitive API.
 - Quick setup; just put your auth token and you're in business.
 - Exposes all functionality in the Bot API 2.3.1, including custom
   keyboards, inline keyboards, force reply, chat actions, deep
   linking, kicking users, editing messages, notifications...
 - Ability to stream downloads and uploads.
 - Powerful, [connect]-style message handling and filtering.

Bots API version implemented: December 4, 2016

### Install

~~~ bash
npm install botgram
~~~

583,583,microsoft/BotBuilder-V3,C#,"# V3 Deprecation Notification

Microsoft Bot Framework SDK V4 was released in September 2018, and since then we have shipped a few dot-release improvements. As announced previously, the V3  SDK is being retired with final long-term support ending on December 31st, 2019.
Accordingly, there will be no more development in this repo. **Existing V3 bot workloads will continue to run without interruption. We have no plans to disrupt any running workloads**.

We highly recommend that you start migrating your V3 bots to V4. In order to support this migration we have produced migration documentation and will provide extended support for migration initiatives (via standard channels such as Stack Overflow and Microsoft Customer Support).

For more information please refer to the following references:
* Migration Documentation: https://aka.ms/bf-migration-overview
* End of lifetime support announcement: https://aka.ms/bfmigfaq
* Primary V4 Repositories to develop Bot Framework bots
  * [Botbuilder for dotnet](https://github.com/microsoft/botbuilder-dotnet)
  * [Botbuilder for JS](https://github.com/microsoft/botbuilder-js) 
* QnA Maker Libraries were replaced with the following V4 libraries:
  * [Libraries for dotnet](https://github.com/Microsoft/botbuilder-dotnet/tree/master/libraries/Microsoft.Bot.Builder.AI.QnA)
  * [Libraries for JS](https://github.com/Microsoft/botbuilder-js/blob/master/libraries/botbuilder-ai/src/qnaMaker.ts)

# Bot Builder SDK 

If you are new to the Bot Builder SDK, we strongly encourage you to build your bot using the [v4 SDK](https://github.com/Microsoft/botbuilder).  

This repo contains version 3.

The Bot Builder SDK enables you to build bots that support different types of interactions with users. You can design conversations in your bot to be freeform. Your bot can also have more guided interactions where it provides the user choices or actions. The conversation can use simple text or more complex rich cards that contain text, images, and action buttons. You can add natural language interactions and questions and answers, which let your users interact with your bots in a natural way.

![Bot Framework](https://botframework.blob.core.windows.net/web/images/bot-framework.png)

The Bot Builder includes a set of [command line tools](https://github.com/microsoft/botbuilder-tools) to streamline end-to-end conversation centric development experience, and an [emulator](https://github.com/microsoft/botframework-emulator) for debugging your bot locally or in the cloud. 

You can create a bot with Bot Builder v3 SDK using your favorite language: 
- [.NET](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/?view=azure-bot-service-3.0)
- [JavaScript](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/?view=azure-bot-service-3.0)

## Documentation
Visit azure.com for the primary [Azure Bot Service documentation page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/?view=azure-bot-service-3.0) to learn about building bots using Bot Builder. There is additional documentation on the SDK, oriented towards contributors. The v3 SDK currently supports two programing language: 
- [.NET](https://github.com/Microsoft/BotBuilder-v3/tree/master/CSharp)
- [JavaScript](https://github.com/Microsoft/BotBuilder-V3/tree/master/Node)

## Samples
Bot builder SDK v3 includes samples for all supported languages:
- [.NET](https://github.com/Microsoft/BotBuilder-Samples/tree/v3-sdk-samples/CSharp)
- [JavaScript](https://github.com/Microsoft/BotBuilder-Samples/tree/v3-sdk-samples/Node)

## Questions and Help 
If you have questions about Bot Builder SDK v3 or using Azure Bot Service, we encourage you to reach out to the community and Azure Bot Service dev team for help.
- For questions which fit the Stack Overflow format (""how does this work?""), we monitor the both [Azure-bot-service](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/azure-bot-service) and [bot framework](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/botframework) tags (search [both](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/azure-bot-service+or+botframework))
- You can also tweet/follow [@msbotframework](https://twitter.com/msbotframework) 

While we do our best to help out on a timely basis, we don't have any promise around the above resources. If you need an SLA on support from us, it's recommended you invest in an [Azure Support plan](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/support/options/).

# Bottom Navigator

Bottom Navigator is a library for managing multiple Fragment backstacks
controlled by the tabs of a BottomNavigationView. It has a simple API
and is feature-rich.

Unlike Material Design's Android recommendations, the state of each
tab's stack is preserved as the user switches between tabs. 

The library keeps a history of previous tabs so that when the current
tab's stack is exhausted the system back button will navigate to the
previously selected tab. Rotation is automatically handled and all
backstacks are preserved.

[Detachability](#detachability)  
[Obtaining a BottomNavigator reference](#obtaining-a-bottomnavigator-reference)  
[Dependencies](#dependencies)  
[Gradle](#gradle)  


## How to Use it

BottomNavigator needs an Activity with a BottomNavigationView and a
fragment container. 

```xml
<LinearLayout 
    android:layout_width=""match_parent""
    android:layout_height=""match_parent""
    android:orientation=""vertical"">

    <FrameLayout
        android:id=""@+id/fragment_container""
        android:layout_width=""match_parent""
        android:layout_height=""0dp""
        android:layout_weight=""1"" />

    <com.google.android.material.bottomnavigation.BottomNavigationView
        android:id=""@+id/bottomnav_view""
        android:layout_width=""match_parent""
        android:layout_height=""56dp""
        app:menu=""@menu/navigation_items"" />
</LinearLayout>
```

Then, in the activity's onCreate you initialize the BottomNavigator by
calling its onCreate function. You need to provide a
`rootFragmentsFactory` that maps the BottomNavigationView's menu items
to the root fragment for each tab. And a `defaultTab` which is the first
tab shown to the user.

```kotlin
    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main)

        navigator = BottomNavigator.onCreate(
            fragmentContainer = R.id.fragment_container,
            bottomNavigationView = findViewById(R.id.bottomnav_view),
            rootFragmentsFactory = mapOf(
                R.id.tab1 to { RootFragment1() },
                R.id.tab2 to { RootFragment2() },
                R.id.tab3 to { RootFragment3() }
            ),
            defaultTab = R.id.tab2,
            activity = this
        )
    }
```

Finally, wire up the back button to the BottomNavigator.

```kotlin
    override fun onBackPressed() {
        if (!navigator.pop()) {
            super.onBackPressed()
        }
    }
```

You can now call methods like `navigator.addFragment(fragment)` to add a
fragment to the current tab's stack, or `navigator.switchTab(R.id.tab1)`
to switch stacks.

Checkout the sample app for a complete example.

## Multiple taps on a tab

When a user taps on the currently shown bottom tab the expectation is
that the tab's state will be reset. If the tab has a backstack then the
stack will be removed leaving the root fragment in whatever state it was
in. Another tap when the root Fragment is shown will recreate the fragment
and replace it with the new root fragment.

In order to get a smoother user experience you can avoid recreating the
root fragment by subscribing to BottomNavigator's
`resetRootFragmentCommand()` rx stream. In the subscription to that stream
you should reset the given root fragment's state. For example, you can
call `smoothScrollToPosition(0)` on a RecyclerView in the Fragment, or
you might clear the text in a search box.

## Detachability

By default as Fragments are hidden and shown as the user navigates
around, the fragments are attached and detached which generates the
`onDestroyView`/`onCreateView` lifecycle on the Fragments. This is good
for memory consumption because it allows View objects that are not being
seen by the user to be garbage collected and then recreated in
onCreateView when the user wants to see them again.

If you do not want hidden Fragments to have their Views destroyed, maybe
because of lifecycle issues or for performance, you can mark a Fragment
as not being detachable. This will cause the fragments to be
hidden/shown without having their Views destroyed. To do this specify
`detachable = false` when adding the fragment, or for root Fragments by
initializing BottomNavigator with `onCreateWithDetachability` and
providing `FragmentInfo` objects to the `rootFragmentsFactory`.

## Obtaining a BottomNavigator reference

BottomNavigator is scoped to an activity session, this means that after
rotation a new Activity gets the same instance from
`BottomNavigator.onCreate` as the previous Activity instance. Fragments
and other objects with reference to the Activity can obtain the same
activity session's navigator instance by calling
`BottomNavigator.provide(activity)`. This allows the Fragments to add
other Fragments to the BottomNavigator.

## Dependencies

BottomNavigator works with AndroidX apps. It is built in Kotlin on top
of Architecture Components and RxJava.

## Gradle 

```groovy
dependencies {
    implementation 'com.pandora.bottomnavigator:bottom-navigator:1.8'
}
```

## How It Works

PieBot is designed to purchase small amounts of your enabled cryptocurrencies at regular intervals, and also aims to keep your holdings the same value by selling over-performers, and buying more of the under-performers.

Simply put, imagine your portfolio as a pie chart. Each slice of the pie represents a cryptocurrency. PieBot aims to keep all slices the same size. Hence PieBot!

PieBot achieves this by running two tasks at different intervals:

### Buy

The Buy task simply buys a set amount of each of your enabled coins.

The value PieBot buys for each coin is set in the `_config.py` file using the `buy_order_value` environment variable. This can be adjusted to meet the needs of your strategy, as well as the frequency at which this task runs, using the `buy_frequency` environment variable.

If there is not enough USDT to complete the whole order, PieBot will skip the task and wait until it is called again.

### Rebalance

The Rebalance task tries to keep all the values of your holdings the same, by selling coins whose values are over the average, and using those profits to buy more of the coins that are below the average.

PieBot will first run through the sell orders, then the buy orders. This is to ensure there is enough USDT available when it comes to the buy orders, just in case the `usdt_reserve` isn't adequate.

The frequency at which this task runs is configured using the `rebalance_frequency` environment variable.

PieBot has no maximum order value for buying or selling a holding to bring it back on target.

### Minimum Order Values

Each order placed during the Buy and Rebalance task is subject to a minimum order value.

This value cannot be changed, and is set at `0.25` USDT per coin. The reasons for this are as follows:

- Firstly, due to the nature of quantity and price decimal points, some coins have a much larger minimum order value than others. For exmaple, `ATOM` only has 2 decimal places for quantity, so `0.01` (the smallest amount) of `ATOM` works out at `0.133 USDT`*. In this example, if an order was placed with a value of `0.12` or lower, the order would be rejected by the exchange, which would make it hard for PieBot to keep your holdings balanced
- Secondly, it prevents situations where the bot might want to rebalance a coin pair if it's `0.01 USDT` over target, which is not an efficent use of trading fees

_*Price correct at time of writing_

## Requirements
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/download) `2.x`
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads) `3.9`
- [Pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip) `21.x`

## Installation

Run these commands to get PieBot's code, and to prepare your environment for setup and usage:

```
git clone https://github.com/piebotai/bot.git PieBot
cd PieBot
sh init.sh
```

`init.sh` is a simple Shell script that handles the set-up for you. It will put you on the correct Git branch, pull down the latest code, and install the required Pip packages:

- [Schedule](https://pypi.org/project/schedule)
- [Termcolor](https://pypi.org/project/termcolor)

## Usage

### Config File

PieBot's settings are handled through a `_config.py` file in the root of the project. This file is not included when you clone the project, as it contains sensitive information, so you'll need to set it up yourself.

In the root of the project is a `_config-example.py` file. Copy and paste this file, and rename the pasted file to `_config.py`.

You should now have two config files in your project **with exactly the same code in them**:

```
_config.py
_config-example.py
```

For now, you can safely ignore `_config-example.py`. Open `_config.py` in your text editor of choice, and configure your environment accordingly:

---

#### environment

This can be one of two options:

- `production` - Real trades with real money
- `dev` - PieBot's logic runs, but no real trades are submitted

**Default value** - `production`

---

#### api_key

The API key for your Crypto.com Exchange account.

---

#### api_secret

The API secret for your Crypto.com Exchange account.

---

#### pair_list

A comma separated list of the coin pairs you want PieBot to trade. For example, this is how we would enable BTC trading using USDT:

`(""BTC"", ""BTC_USDT"")`

You will need to define both the token you want to trade, and the whole coin pair, just like above.

---

#### buy_frequency

Set after how many hours the **Buy** task should repeat.

**Default value** - `6`

---

#### rebalance_frequency

Set after how many hours the **Rebalance** task should repeat.

You can stop the Rebalance task from running by setting the value as `0`. In this situation, PieBot would just run the Buy task, and nothing else.

**Default value** - `1`

---

#### rebalance_threshold

Sets the desired price deviation a coin must meet before it is rebalanced.

By specifying a target percentage, rather than just requiring the deviation to be greater than or equal to the minimum order value, you dramatically reduce the number of trades PieBot completes in any given cycle, which can help reduce fees.

For example, if `rebalance_threshold` is set to `0.025`, then each coin pair must be greater than or equal to 2.5% above or below the target coin price. So, coins that are within the 0% - 2.49999...% window will not be rebalanced in this cycle.

The value reflects a percentage, and should be between `0` and `1`.

For example, 5% = `0.05`, 15% = `0.15` etc.

**Default value** - `0.03`

---

#### buy_order_value

The USDT value that PieBot will buy for each enabled coin pair in the Buy task.

For example, with 10 enabled coin pairs, and a `buy_order_value` of `0.5`, the Buy task would use a total of `5.00 USDT` - `0.5 * 10` each time it is run.

**Default value** - `0.50`

---

#### usdt_reserve

This value tells PieBot how much USDT it should keep aside to not trade with.

The value reflects a percentage, and should be between `0` and `1`.

For example, 5% = `0.05`, 15% = `0.15` etc.

**It is strongly recommended that you don't set this value as 0.** It's a good idea to leave some USDT in reserve, so PieBot has some equity available should it need it.

**Default value** - `0.02`

---

### Operation

It is strongly recommended running PieBot with a process manager such as [PM2](https://pm2.keymetrics.io).

#### Running PieBot

To start PieBot without PM2, simply run:

```python
python3 PieBot.py
```

To start PieBot with PM2, run the above command first to make sure everything is working. If no errors come back, and you see the ""Waiting to be called"" message, stop the bot and start it again with PM2:

```python
pm2 start PieBot.py --name PieBot --interpreter=python3
```

Once it is running, you can view the logs for that PM2 process like so:

```
pm2 logs PieBot
```

#### Dev mode

By setting `environment = ""dev""` in your `_config.py` file, you can run PieBot without placing any real world trades. This is a good way of running the bot for the first time to ensure everything is working, without the risk of placing real trades for real money.

As PieBot is split into two distinct tasks; [Buy](#buy) and [Rebalance](#rebalance), you will need to specify which task you want to run by using one of these commands:

```
python3 PieBot.py Buy
python3 PieBot.py Rebalance
```

When in dev mode, PieBot uses exactly the same logic as if you were running the bot in the real world. The bot attempts to connect to your account through your API key, it will collect your coin balances and work everything out it needs to. You will even see exactly the same console output. The only difference being that orders aren't actually placed.

### Updating

PieBot updates are pushed directly to this Git repository, so a simple `git pull` on the `main` branch is normally all that is required to run the latest version of the bot. Luckily there is a little script file you can run that handles it for you.

**Ensure you have stopped PieBot before updating it, and restart it again once you have updated.**

```
sh update.sh
```

## Before running any bots

**Use descriptive useragents**. Include a username by which admins can identify you. Tell what your bot is doing and why. Convince the admins that you aren't wasting their bandwidth. Inadequate useragents may cause your bot to get logged out in the middle of your session, and the program will crash. Abusive useragents can get your bot shadowbanned.

A charismatic ruby client for [Telegram's Bot API](https://core.telegram.org/bots).

Write your own Telegram Bot using Ruby! Yay!

Currently under heavy development.
Please [collaborate](https://github.com/eljojo/telegram_bot/issues/new) with your questions, ideas or problems!

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile (currently under development):

```ruby
gem 'telegram_bot'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

## Usage

Here's an example:

```ruby
require 'telegram_bot'

bot = TelegramBot.new(token: '[YOUR TELEGRAM BOT TOKEN GOES HERE]')
bot.get_updates(fail_silently: true) do |message|
  puts ""@#{message.from.username}: #{message.text}""
  command = message.get_command_for(bot)

  message.reply do |reply|
    case command
    when /greet/i
      reply.text = ""Hello, #{message.from.first_name}!""
    else
      reply.text = ""#{message.from.first_name}, have no idea what #{command.inspect} means.""
    end
    puts ""sending #{reply.text.inspect} to @#{message.from.username}""
    reply.send_with(bot)
  end
end
```

Here's a sample output:

```
$ bundle exec ruby bot.rb
@eljojo: greet
sending ""Hello, José!"" to @eljojo
@eljojo: heeeeeeeeya!
sending ""José, have no idea what \""heeeeeeeeya!\"" means."" to @eljojo
```

## How do I get a Bot Token

Talk to the [@BotFather](https://telegram.me/botfather).
You can find more info [here](https://core.telegram.org/bots).

![How to get Token](http://i.imgur.com/90ya4Oe.png)

## What else can it do?

you can pass options to the bot initializer:
```ruby
bot = TelegramBot.new(token: 'abc', logger: Logger.new(STDOUT), offset: 123, timeout: 20)
```

if you don't want to start the loop, don't pass a block to ``#get_updates`` and you'll get an array with the latest messages:
```ruby
messages = bot.get_updates(timeout: 30, offset: 123)
```

Because things can go wrong sometimes with the API, there's a ``fail_silently`` option that you can pass to ``#get_updates`` like this:
```ruby
bot.get_updates(fail_silently: true) do |message|
  puts message.text
end
```

A message has several attributes:
```ruby
message = bot.get_updates.last

# message data
message.text # ""hello moto""
message.date # Wed, 01 Jul 2015 09:52:54 +0200 (DateTime)

# reading user
message.from # TelegramBot::User
message.from.first_name # ""Homer""
message.from.last_name  # ""Simpson""
message.from.username   # ""mr_x""

# channel
message.channel.id # 123123123 (telegram's id)

# reply
message.reply do |reply|
  reply.text = ""homer please clean the garage""
  reply.send_with(bot)
end
# or
reply = message.reply
reply.text = ""i'll do it after going to moe's""
bot.send_message(reply)
```

To send message to specific channel you could do following:

```ruby
bot = TelegramBot.new(token: '[YOUR TELEGRAM BOT TOKEN GOES HERE]')
channel = TelegramBot::Channel.new(id: channel_id)
message = TelegramBot::OutMessage.new
message.chat = channel
message.text = 'Some message'

message.send_with(bot)

```

Also you may pass additional options described in [API Docs](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#sendmessage)

```ruby
message.parse_mode = 'Markdown'
```

593,593,Makeblock-official/mDrawBot,Python,"#mDrawBot ---- Draw Your Own Legend

## Notes for Mac Users

1. Use [Version 1.2.2](http://download.makeblock.com/mdraw/mDraw_V1.2.2_mac.app.zip) - it fixed some issues on firmware update.
2. If you use Mac Os Sierra, update the serial chip driver [following this guide](http://www.mblock.cc/posts/run-makeblock-ch340-ch341-on-mac-os-sierra). Apple changed the way drivers run.


## What is mDrawBot ?

mDrawbot is a four-in-one drawing robotic kit, you can assembly into 4 different configuration drawing robots: **mScara, mCar, mSpide and mEggBot**. This kit consists of Makeblock parts. We designed a powerful software named mDraw to control these robots, it also can control the XY Plotter V2.0 based on Makeblock platform.

![mDrawBot](http://learn.makeblock.cc/cn/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/B17.png)

This kit consists of over 60 components from Makeblock, including beams, brackets, motor, etc. It also comes with a specially-designed software named mDraw to control these robots. Here's the picture of all the components.

![mDrawBot parts](http://learn.makeblock.com/cn/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/B02.png)

#### **mScara**

mScara is a SCARA （Selective Compliance Articulated Robot Arm）drive by stepper motor. If you install a pen on mScara, it can draw the pattern on a flat surface. If you install the laser upgrade pack, it can turn into a desktop laser engraver machine.

![mScara](https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/003/432/915/324ed686cdb7fce96d418152848a8aea_original.gif?v=1426240502&w=700&h=&fit=max&auto=format&q=92&s=05da7bbe775b6da861365368d802d1ea)

#### **mSpider**

mSpider is a skilled drawing robot can draw pictures on wall or white boards. Two stepper motors control the movement of mSpider according the rope. In theory, increasing the length of rope it can draw on quite wide wall.

![mSpider](https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/003/427/605/a244936d7b1c613531befbd193fe4c0b_original.gif?v=1426169539&w=700&h=&fit=max&auto=format&q=92&s=4f6659e51d5f41890f7b90965750feaa)

#### **mEggBot**

mEggBot is designed to draw on all kinds of things that are normally impossible to print on, such as eggs or ping-pong balls. You can write letters or draw expression on egess or writing on Easter eggs.

## How to Use mDrawBot? 

Each mDrawBot kit can be assembled into any of the 4 different configurations. We provide the detailed assembling instructions that enables you to build any configuration in an hour. 
The assembly instructions and the user guide can be downloaded here: [http://learn.makeblock.cc/mdrawbot/](http://learn.makeblock.cc/mdrawbot/)

## Software 

mDraw is the software specially designed for mDrawBot. After installing the mDraw software, you can import images that you wish your robot to draw. It is completely compatible with the four forms of mDrawBot and also both the servo mode and laser mode of Makeblock XY Plotter V2.0. 

## Features of mDraw 

 - Support mScara, mSpider, mEggBot, mCar, XY  
 - Support both pen drawing and laser engraving  
 - Support custom settings of motor direction, drawing range, etc  
 - Support saving parameters  
 - Support SVG. file  
 - Support conversion from BMP to SVG  
 - Support zooming, rotating, mirroring, and moving the SVG graphics  
 - Support Windows7 or later. (Will be available in Mac OS X, Linux soon.)  

## About mDrawBot’s upgrade.

You can also design your own upgrade pack for your mDrawBot. By adding an [accelerometer and gyro sensor](http://www.makeblock.cc/me-3-axis-accelerometer-and-gyro-sensor/), it will become a two-wheeled self-balancing vehicle. Add some additional Makeblock mechanical parts and it may be transformed into a [XY plotter](http://www.makeblock.cc/xy-plotter-robot-kit-v2-0-with-electronic/). The only limit is your imagination.

(Note: You need to prepare the parts needed.)

### How do I work?

The `/analysis` folder contains data files for the project. The `sentences.csv` contains the base training dataset which is used to classify the user's input into three classes - *Statement*, *Question*, and *Chat*. Going through some examples would clarify the difference between statement and chat. The `featuresDump.csv` is the result of text pre-processing done using the code in `features.py` and `featuresDump.py`.

# Botkit Starter Kit for Slack Bots

This repo contains everything you need to get started building a Slack bot with [Botkit](https://botkit.ai).

Botkit is designed to ease the process of designing and running useful, creative bots that live inside messaging platforms. Bots are applications that can send and receive messages, and in many cases, appear alongside their human counterparts as users.

Some bots talk like people, others silently work in the background, while others present interfaces much like modern mobile applications. Botkit gives developers the necessary tools for building bots of any kind! It provides an easy-to-understand interface for sending and receiving messages so that developers can focus on creating novel applications and experiences instead of dealing with API endpoints.

Our goal with Botkit is to make bot building easy, fun, and accessible to anyone with the desire to create a future filled with talking machines!

If you are looking to create a bot on other platforms using Glitch, check out the [Botkit project page](https://glitch.com/botkit).

### What's Included
* [Botkit core](https://botkit.ai/docs/core.html) - a complete programming system for building conversational software
* [Pre-configured Express.js webserver](https://expressjs.com/) including:
   * A customizable ""Install my Bot"" homepage
   * Login and oauth endpoints that allow teams to install your bot
   * Webhook endpoints for communicating with platforms
* Sample skill modules that demonstrate various features of Botkit

### Getting Started

There are a myriad of methods you can use to set up an application on Slack, here are some of your options:

#### Install Botkit

[Remix this project on Glitch](https://glitch.com/~botkit-slack)

[Deploy to Heroku](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/howdyai/botkit-starter-slack/master)

Clone this repository using Git:

`git clone https://github.com/howdyai/botkit-starter-slack.git`

Install dependencies, including [Botkit](https://github.com/howdyai/botkit):

```
cd botkit-starter-slack
npm install
```

#### Set up your Slack Application 
Once you have setup your Botkit development enviroment, the next thing you will want to do is set up a new Slack application via the [Slack developer portal](https://api.slack.com/). This is a multi-step process, but only takes a few minutes. 

* [Read this step-by-step guide](https://botkit.ai/docs/provisioning/slack-events-api.html) to make sure everything is set up. 

* We also have this [handy video walkthrough](https://youtu.be/us2zdf0vRz0) for setting up this project with Glitch.

Update the `.env` file with your newly acquired tokens.

Launch your bot application by typing:

`node .`

Now, visit your new bot's login page: http://localhost:3000/login

Now comes the fun part of [making your bot!](https://botkit.ai/docs/#build-your-bot)


### Extend This Starter kit

This starter kit is designed to provide developers a robust starting point for building a custom bot. Included in the code are a set of sample bot ""skills"" that illustrate various aspects of the Botkit SDK features.  Once you are familiar with how Botkit works, you may safely delete all of the files in the `skills/` subfolder.

Developers will build custom features as modules that live in the `skills/` folder. The main bot application will automatically include any files placed there.

A skill module should be in the format:

```
module.exports = function(controller) {

    // add event handlers to controller
    // such as hears handlers that match triggers defined in code
    // or controller.studio.before, validate, and after which tie into triggers
    // defined in the Botkit CMS UI.

}
```

### Customize Storage

By default, the starter kit uses a simple file-system based storage mechanism to record information about the teams and users that interact with the bot. While this is fine for development, or use by a single team, most developers will want to customize the code to use a real database system.

There are [Botkit plugins for all the major database systems](https://botkit.ai/readme-middlewares.html#storage-modules) which can be enabled with just a few lines of code.

We have enabled our [Mongo middleware]() for starters in this project. To use your own Mongo database, just fill out `MONGO_URI` in your `.env` file with the appropriate information. For tips on reading and writing to storage, [check out these medium posts](https://botkit.groovehq.com/knowledge_base/categories/build-a-bot)

# About Botkit

Botkit is a product of [Howdy](https://howdy.ai) and made in Austin, TX with the help of a worldwide community of botheads.
"
597,597,dotnet-architecture/eShopOnContainersAI,JavaScript,"# eShopOnContainersAI 

## Definition and goals

This repo has a forked version of https://github.com/dotnet-architecture/eShopOnContainers which has been evolved by adding AI and ML features.

*eShopOnContainers* is a cloud-native application based on microservices architecture and Docker containers.
*eShopOnContainersAI* is therefore a forked version of eShopOnContainers that is extended with AI features (Machine Learning and Deep Learning) plus a Bot client as a new client app which surfaces all the AI features along with the modified MVC web application.

Main AI/ML technologies used are:

- **ML.NET (Machine Learning .NET)**
- **Azure Cognitive Services (Computer Vision)**
- **TensorFlow / TensorFlowSharp**
- **CNTK**
- **Bot Framework**

Here's a vision of the architecture where the grayed area is what is coming derived from https://github.com/dotnet-architecture/eShopOnContainers and the rest of the diagram is about the new added AI features.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1712635/42792118-bc21b18e-8928-11e8-9084-a5a6af87c8ba.png)

(*) Note that the architecture diagram is currently missing the ML.NET microservice, but the ML.NET scenario is explained in the Wiki.
This diagram will be updated soon.

The following diagram positions the multiple AI technologies per AI function and type:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1222398/36477436-746362e6-1701-11e8-9312-52faecbda715.png)

You will learn how to use Pre-Built models (such as in Cognitive Services), Pre-Trained and Custom models to add AI and ML features into any application:

*	Regression Models: These models are the most well-known and used around any kind of scenarios. Although they are very simple (compared with other models like deep neural networks) they are still the most used around the world. In eShopOnContainersAI we will use regression models to predict future product demand, training the algorithm with the order history data.
*	Recommendation systems: One of the most used cases, recommend products from the basket, will be used as example of these models.
*	Natural Language Processing: Bots are the corner stone of current AI applications. You will learn how to create new solutions based in BOT framework, integrate bots in your current applications, or use L.U.I.S. to get information about user intents, 
*	Computer Vision: These models gained much traction in current decade, and industry is investing large amount of resources in this field. Using different strategies, you will learn how to search for similar images, using Cognitive Services or deploying your own custom trained models.


See Wiki for how set it up and see the multiple scenarios:

"
598,598,dueros/bot-sdk-node.js,JavaScript,"# 度秘BOT SDK for nodejs
这是一个帮助开发Bot的SDK，我们强烈建议您使用这个SDK开发度秘的Bot。当然，您可以完全自己来处理DuerOS的协议，自己完成session、nlu、result的处理，但是度秘的DuerOS对BOT的协议会经常进行升级，这样会给您带来一些麻烦。这个SDK会与DuerOS的协议一起升级，会最大限度减少对您开发bot的影响。

## 通过bot-sdk可以快速的开发bot
我们的目标是通过使用bot-sdk，可以迅速的开发一个bot，而不必过多去关注DuerOS对Bot的复杂协议。我们提供如下功能：

* 封装了DuerOS的request和response
* 提供了session简化接口
* 提供了nlu简化接口
    * slot 操作
    * nlu理解交互接口（ask）
* 提供了多轮对话开发接口
* 提供了事件监听接口

## 安装、使用BOT SDK进行开发 
度秘BOT SDK采用npm加载 , node.js版本确保在6.10及以上。使用执行如下命令进行安装：
```shell
npm install bot-sdk --save
```

### 下面通过一个例子来完整的说明如何使用js的 bot-sdk 来完成一个Bot技能的开发：
 1.新建文件目录安装相关依赖
```shell
cd /to/your/path
mkdir js-bot-demo
cd js-bot-demo
npm init
npm install express --save
npm install bot-sdk --save
```

 2.创建index.js入口文件
 在js-bot-demo中创建index.js, 内容如下：
```js
const express = require('express');

const Bot = require('./Bot');
let app = express();

// 探活请求
app.head('/', (req, res) => {
    res.sendStatus(204);
});

app.post('/', (req, res) => {
    req.rawBody = '';

    req.setEncoding('utf8');
    req.on('data', chunk => {
        req.rawBody += chunk;
    });

    req.on('end', () => {
        let b = new Bot(JSON.parse(req.rawBody));
        // 开启签名认证
        // 本地运行可以先注释
        // b.initCertificate(req.headers, req.rawBody).enableVerifyRequestSign();

        b.run().then(result => {
            res.send(result);
        });
    });
}).listen(8016);

console.log('listen 8016');
```
index.js是Bot启动的入口文件，这里使用express启动监听8016 web端口。你也可以使用其他HttpServer模块，如koa等。

3. 创建Bot.js
```javascript
const BaseBot = require('bot-sdk');
class Bot extends BaseBot {
    /**
     * postData可以不传，由于DuerOS对bot是post请求，sdk默认自动获取
     */
    constructor(postData) {
            super(postData);

            this.addLaunchHandler(() => {
                return {
                    outputSpeech: '欢迎使用!'
                };
            });

            this.addIntentHandler('personal_income_tax.inquiry', () => {
                let loc = this.getSlot('location');
                let monthlySalary = this.getSlot('monthlysalary');

                if (!monthlySalary) {
                    this.nlu.ask('monthlySalary');
                    //  let card = new Bot.Card.TextCard('你工资多少呢');

                    //  如果有异步操作，可以返回一个promise
                    return new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {
                        resolve({
                            directives: [this.getTemplate1('你工资多少呢')],
                            outputSpeech: '你工资多少呢'
                        });
                    });
                }

                if (!loc) {
                    //  let card = new Bot.Card.TextCard('你在哪呢');
                    this.nlu.ask('location');

                        directives: [this.getTemplate1('你在哪呢')],
                        outputSpeech: '你在哪呢'
                    };

                }
            });
    }
    /**

    getTemplate1(text) {
        let bodyTemplate = new BaseBot.Directive.Display.Template.BodyTemplate1();
        bodyTemplate.setPlainTextContent(text);
        let renderTemplate = new BaseBot.Directive.Display.RenderTemplate(bodyTemplate);
        return renderTemplate;
    }
}
```
Bot.js是技能的逻辑处理模块，`this.addLaunchHandler`是添加技能唤醒的处理函数, 一般是是关于本技能介绍的欢迎语或者关于使用方法的介绍。 `this.addIntentHandler`是添加意图的处理函数，此函数有2个参数，第一个是与dbp平台配置的
意图名称，示例中的`personal_income_tax.inquiry`就是意图名称，第二个参数意图处理逻辑，Bot在进行意图请求时，一般包含相关的槽位信息，槽位是用户意图的关键信息，进行意图的逻辑处理时会使用到，
一般在使用之前会进行是否为空的判断。除此之外，还可以添加客户端的事件监听处理函数`this.addEventListener`, 也包含意图名称和处理逻辑2个参数。所有的逻辑处理函数的返回结果可以是json Object 也可以是Promise包裹的json Object。 示例中的处理逻辑比较简单，只做演示使用，用户可以根据自己的需求进行逻辑的扩展以及模块的封装。

4. 运行Bot
```shell
node index.js
```


`template`展现模版
为了更好的在有屏设备端上展现技能，DuerOS提供了多种展现模板供开发者使用。展现模板分body template和list template两种类型。其中body template由图片和文字组成，list template由一系列list item组成，每个list item由图片和文字组成。不同的展现模板适合不同的场景，开发者可以根据技能展现的需求选择合适的模板。关于模板的详细功能和展现效果可以参考DuerOS模板文档，[模板文档](https://dueros.baidu.com/didp/doc/dueros-bot-platform/dbp-custom/display-template_markdown)

### 文本展现模板

    let directive = new RenderTemplate(bodyTemplate);
    return {
        directives: [directive],
        outputSpeech: '点击后展现'
    };
});

```


`card`展现卡片
在有屏设备上，您的技能在回复用户时，可以通过使用卡片展现更生动、丰富的内容。常用的展现卡片类型有文本卡片、标准卡片、标准列表卡片、图片卡片。展现卡片随Response消息一起发送给DuerOS。具体展现卡片的功能和展示效果可以参考DuerOS展现卡片文档:
[卡片文档](https://dueros.baidu.com/didp/doc/dueros-bot-platform/dbp-custom/cards_markdown)
### 文本卡片
`TextCard`
```javascript
const BaseBot = require('bot-sdk');
const TextCard = BaseBot.Card.TextCard;

let card = new TextCard('content');
//or
card = new TextCard();
//设置content
card.setContent('Content');
//设置链接
card.setAnchor('http://www.baidu.com');
card.setAnchor('http://www.baidu.com', 'showtext');
//设置cueWords
card.addCueWords('hint1');
card.addCueWords(['hint1', 'hint2']);

return {
    card: card
};

```

### 标准卡片
`StandardCard`

```javascript
const BaseBot = require('bot-sdk');
const StandardCard = BaseBot.Card.StandardCard;
let card = new StandardCard();

card.setTitle('title');
card.setContent('content');
card.setImage('http://www...');
card.setAnchor('http://www.baidu.com');

return {
    card: card
};

```

### 列表卡片
`ListCard`

```javascript
const BaseBot = require('bot-sdk');
const ListCard = BaseBot.Card.ListCard;
const ListCardItem = BaseBot.Card.ListCard.Item;

let card = new ListCard();

let item = new ListCardItem();
item.setTitle('title')
item.setContent('content')
item.setUrl('http://www')
item.setImage('http://www.png');

card.addItem(item);
card.addItem(item);

return {
    card: card
};

```

### 列表卡片点击事件处理
`Screen.LinkClicked`
如果卡片或者卡片列表配置了URL地址，当用户点击卡片或者卡片列表时，DuerOS会向技能发送Screen.LinkClicked事件，技能收到该事件后会返回需要展现的内容。
```javascript
const BaseBot = require('bot-sdk');
const StandardCard = BaseBot.Card.StandardCard;

this.addEventListener('Screen.LinkClicked', function(event) {
    let url = event.url;
    let token = event.token;

    card = new StandardCard();
    card.setTitle('title');
    card.setContent('content');

    return {
        card: card
    };
});

```

### 图片卡片
`ImageCard`

```javascript
const BaseBot = require('bot-sdk');
const ImageCard = BaseBot.Card.ImageCard;
let card = new ImageCard();
card.addItem('http://src.image', 'http://thumbnail.image');
```
`directive`返回指令

### 音乐播放指令
`AudioPlayer.Play`

```javascript
const BaseBot = require('bot-sdk');
const Play = BaseBot.Directive.AudioPlayer.Play

let directive = new Play('http://www.music', Play.REPLACE_ALL); 
return {
    directives: [directive],
    outputSpeech: '正在为你播放歌曲'
};
```

### 渲染音频播放器的主界面
`AudioPlayer.Play`指令中增加playerInfo信息
```javascript
const BaseBot = require('bot-sdk');
const Play = BaseBot.Directive.AudioPlayer.Play;
const PlayerInfo = BaseBot.Directive.AudioPlayer.PlayerInfo;
const PlayPauseButton = BaseBot.Directive.AudioPlayer.Control.PlayPauseButton;
const NextButoon = BaseBot.Directive.AudioPlayer.Control.NextButoon;
const PreviousButton = BaseBot.Directive.AudioPlayer.Control.PreviousButton;

//创建音频播放指令
let directive = new Play('http://www.music', Play.REPLACE_ALL);

//音频播放器的主界面
let playerInfo = new PlayerInfo();
//创建暂停按钮
let playpause = new PlayPauseButton();
letr previous = new PreviousButton();
let controls = [
   playpause,
   previous
];

//设置PlayerInfo的Controls内容
playerInfo.setControls(controls);

//也可以使用addControl,增加一个control
playerInfo.addControl(new NextButoon());

playerInfo.setTitle('周杰伦');
playerInfo.setTitleSubtext1('七里香');

//设置Play指令的PlayerInfo
directive.setPlayerInfo(playerInfo);
return {
    directives: [directive],
    outputSpeech: '周杰伦,七里香'
};

```

### 停止端上的播放音频

`AudioPlayer.Stop`

```javascript
const BaseBot = require('bot-sdk');
const Stop = BaseBot.Directive.AudioPlayer.Stop;

let directive = new Stop(); 
return {
    directives: [directive],
    outputSpeech: '已经停止播放'
};
```

### 音频事件处理
Bot可以通过`addEventListener`接口来监听音频播放的时的事件，下面以AudioPlayer.PlaybackNearlyFinished事件举例。
```javascript
const BaseBot = require('bot-sdk');
const Play = BaseBot.Directive.AudioPlayer.Play;
this.addEventListener('AudioPlayer.PlaybackNearlyFinished', function(event) {
    let token = event.token;
    let directive = new Play('http://www.audio', Play.ENQUEUE); 
    return {
        directives: [directive],
    };
});
```

### 视频播放
VideoPlayer视频播放提供了VideoPlayer指令接口和VideoPlayer事件接口。VideoPlayer指令是技能向DuerOS发送的，对视频进行控制的指令，如播放指令、停止播放指令等。DuerOS收到指令后会转化成端上能识别的播放指令，对视频进行相应的控制。VideoPlayer事件是指在视频播放过程中触发一系列事件，DuerOS会将这些事件上报给技能，请求技能进行处理。具体协议内容可以参考视频协议文档，[视频协议文档](https://dueros.baidu.com/didp/doc/dueros-bot-platform/dbp-custom/videoplayer_markdown)

### 视频播放指令
`VideoPlayer.Play`

```javascript
const BaseBot = require('bot-sdk');
const Play = BaseBot.Directive.VideoPlayer.Play;

let directive = new Play('http://www.video', Play.REPLACE_ALL); 
return {
    directives: [directive],
    outputSpeech: '正在为你播放视频'
};
```

### 停止端上播放的视频
`VideoPlayer.Stop`

```javascript
const BaseBot = require('bot-sdk');
const Stop = BaseBot.Directive.VideoPlayer.Stop;
let directive = new Stop(); 
return {
    directives: [directive],
    outputSpeech: '已经停止播放'
};
```

### 视频事件处理
Bot可以通过`addEventListener`接口来监听视频播放的时的事件，下面以VideoPlayer.PlaybackNearlyFinished事件举例。
```javascript
const BaseBot = require('bot-sdk');
const Play = BaseBot.Directive.VideoPlayer.Play;
this.addEventListener('VideoPlayer.PlaybackNearlyFinished', function(event) {
    let token = event.token;
    let offsetInMilliseconds = event.offsetInMilliseconds;
    let directive = new Play('http://www.video', Play.ENQUEUE); 
    return {
        'directives' => [directive],
    };
});
```

### 获取端屏幕展现状态
```javascript
let screenContext = this.request.getScreenContext();
```
### 渲染引导词
使用`Hint`指令渲染引导词
```javascript
const BaseBot = require('bot-sdk');
const Hint = BaseBot.Directive.Display.Hint;
const TextCard = BaseBot.Card.TextCard;

let directive = new Hint(['hint1', 'hint2']);
return {
    card: new TextCard('测试Hint指令'),
    directives: [directive]
};
```

## 返回speech
### outputSpeech
上面例子，除了返回`card`之外，还可以返回outputSpeech，让客户端播报tts：
```javascript
return {
    outputSpeech: '请问你要干啥呢',
    //或者ssml
    outputSpeech; '<speak>请问你要干啥呢</speak>'
};
```
### reprompt
当客户端响应用户后，用户可能会一段时间不说话，如果你返回了reprompt，客户端会提示用户输入
```javascript
return {
    reprompt: 'hello，请问你要干啥呢',
    //或者ssml
    reprompt: '<speak>hello，请问你要干啥呢</speak>'
};
```


## Lanuch & SessionEnd
### bot开始服务
当bot被@（通过bot唤醒名打开时），DuerOS会发送`LanuchRequest`给bot，此时，bot可以返回欢迎语或者操作提示：
```javascript
this.addLaunchHandler(function() {
    return {
        outputSpeech: '<speak>欢迎光临</speak>' 
    };
});

```

### bot 结束服务
当用户表达退出bot时，DuerOS会发送`SessionEndedRequest`：
```javascript
this.addSessionEndedHandler(function(){
    // clear status
    // 清空状态，结束会话。 
    return null; 
});

```

## 使多轮对话管理更加简单
往往用户一次表达的需求，信息不一定完整，比如：'给我创建一个闹钟'，由于query中没有提醒的时间，一个好的bot实现会问用户：'我应该什么时候提醒你呢？'，这时用户说明天上午8点，这样bot就能获取设置时间，可以为用户创建一个闹钟。比如，你可以这样来实现：

```javascript
//提醒意图而且有提醒时间slot
this.addIntentHandler('remind', () => {
    let remindTime = this.getSlot('remind_time');
    if(remindTime) {
        return [/*设置闹钟指令*/];
    }

    //当前面条件不满足（没有提醒时间），会执行这个handler
    this.nlu.ask('remind_time');
    let card = new TextCard('要几点的闹钟呢?');
    return {
        card: card,
        outputSpeech: '要几点的闹钟呢?'
    };
});

//监听events
this.addEventListener('Alerts.SetAlertSucceeded', event => {
    //do sth. eg. set alert status 
    let card = new TextCard('闹钟创建成功');
    return {
        card: card
    };
});

this.addEventListener('AudioPlayer.PlaybackNearlyFinished', event => {
    let offset = event['offsetInMilliSeconds'];
    //todo sth，比如：返回一个播放enqueue
    let directive = new Play('ENQUEUE'); 
    let directive.setUrl('http://wwww');
    return {
        directives: [directive]
    };
});
```
Bot-sdk会根据通过`addIntentHandler`添加handler的顺序来遍历所有的检查条件，寻找条件满足的handler来执行回调，并且当回调函数返回值不是`null`时结束遍历，将这个不为`null`的值返回。

NLU会维护slot的值，merge每次对话解析出的slot，你可以不用自己来处理，DuerOS每次请求Bot时会将merge的slot都下发。`session`内的数据完全由你来维护，你可以用来存储一些状态，比如打车Bot会用来存储当前的订单状态。你可以通过如下接口来使用`slot`和`session`：
```javascript
//slot
getSlot('slot name');
setSlot('slot name', 'slot value');// 如果没有找到对应的slot，会自动新增一个slot

//session
getSessionAttribute('key');
setSessionAttribute('key', 'value');
//or
setSessionAttribute('key.key1', 'value');
getSessionAttribute('key.key1');

//清空session
clearSession();
```

你的Bot可以订阅端上触发的事件，通过接口`addEventListener`实现，比如端上设置闹钟成功后，会下发`SetAlertSucceeded`的事件，Bot通过注册事件处理函数，进行相关的操作。如果不想每个事件都进行处理可以通过接口`addDefaultEventListener`来统一处理，没有通过`addEventListener`订阅的事件。
```javascript
this.addDefaultEventListener(event => {
    this.waitAnswer();  //不结束回话，即shouldEndSession为false。
    this.setExpectSpeech(false);  //端关闭麦克风，不继续监听
});
```

## NLU交互协议
在DuerOS Bot Platform平台，可以通过nlu工具，添加了针对槽位询问的配置，包括：

* 是否必选，对应询问的默认话术
* 是否需要用户确认槽位内容，以及对应的话术
* 是否需要用户在执行动作前，对所有的槽位确认一遍，以及对应的话术

针对填槽多轮，Bot发起对用户收集、确认槽位（如果针对特定槽位有设置确认选项，就进行确认）、确认意图（如果有设置确认选项）的询问，bot-sdk提供了方便的快捷函数支持：

*注意：一次返回的对话directive，只有一个，如果多次设置，只有最后一次的生效*

### ask
多轮对话的bot，会通过询问用户来收集完成任务所需要的槽位信息，询问用户的特点总结为3点，`ask`：问一个特定的槽位。比如，打车服务收到用户的打车意图的时候，发现没有提供目的地，就可以ask `destination`(目的地的槽位名)：
```javascript
//打车意图，但是没有提供目的地
this.addIntentHandler('rent_car.book', () => {
    let endPoint = this.getSlot('destination');
    if(!endPoint) {
        //询问slot: destination
        this.nlu.ask('destination');
    
        let card = new TextCard('打车去哪呢');
        return {
            card: card
        };
    }
});
```

### delegate

将处理交给DuerOS的对话管理模块DM（Dialog Management），按事先配置的顺序，包括对缺失槽位的询问，槽位值的确认（如果设置了槽位需要确认，以及确认的话术）,整个意图的确认（如果设置了意图需要确认，以及确认的话术。比如可以将收集的槽位依次列出，等待用户确认）

```javascript
this.addIntentHandler('your intent name', () => {
    if(!this.request.isDialogStateCompleted()) {
        // 如果使用了delegate 就不再需要使用setConfirmSlot/setConfirmIntent，否则返回的directive会被后set的覆盖。
        return this.nlu.setDelegate();
    }
    //do sth else
});
```

### confirm slot 

主动发起对一个槽位的确认，此时还需同时返回询问的outputSpeach。主动发起的确认，DM不会使用默认配置的话术。

```javascript
this.addIntentHandler('your intent name', () => {
    if(this.getSlot('money') > 10000000000) {
        this.nlu.setConfirmSlot('money');
        return {
            outputSpeech: '你确认充话费：10000000000'
        };
    }
    //do sth else
});
```

### confirm intent

主动发起对一个意图的确认，此时还需同时返回询问的outputSpeach。主动发起的确认，DM不会使用默认配置的话术。

一般当槽位填槽完毕，在进行下一步操作之前，一次性的询问各个槽位，是否符合用户预期。

```javascript
this.addIntentHandler('your intent name', () => {
    let money = this.getSlot('money');
    let phone = this.getSlot('phone');
    if(money && phone) {
        this.nlu.setConfirmIntent();
        return {
            outputSpeech: `你确认充话费：${money}，充值手机：${phone}`,
        };
    }
    //do sth else
});
```
## API接口权限调用(返回Promise)
### 获取地理位置API
通过getDeviceLocation方法获取用户的地理位置：
```javascript
this.getDeviceLocation().then(locationInfo => {
    //开发者根据返回结果参数处理逻辑
	//console.log(JSON.stringify(locationInfo));
    //do sth else

    ""message"":{
        ""type"":""Standard"", //推送类型
        ""content"":{
            ""title"":""推送内容标题"", //推送内容标题
            ""description"": ""description"",  // 描述
            ""url"": ""http://.."" //url链接
        }
    }
};

this.sendMateappNotification(data).then(notificationRes => {
    //开发者根据返回结果参数处理逻辑
	//console.log(JSON.stringify(notificationRes)); 
    //do sth else
});
```

## 数据统计
### BotMonitor是什么
它可以帮助您收集和分析您开发的bot运行中产生的数据，帮助您实时查看应用运行状态，及时发现应用中存在的问题，提升>用户体验。目前，BotMonitor提供应用性能分析、用户行为统计。使用BotMonitor，您可以方便的在自己的DBP平台查看Bot的用户量、会话量、请求量、QPS以及Session的相关统计数据指标。

### bot-sdk如何使用BotMonitor数据统计
在construct中使用如下方法
```javascript
//privateKey为私钥内容,0代表你的Bot在DBP平台debug环境，1或者其他整数代表online环境
this.botMonitor.setEnvironmentInfo(privateKey, 0);
//环境信息配置完成后，你需要打开BotMonitor数据采集上报开关(默认是开启的,你可以根据自己需求打开或者关闭),true代表打开，false代表关闭
this.botMonitor.setMonitorEnabled(true);
```
具体数据统计的说明和使用可以参考BotMonitor文档:
[BotMonitor文档](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bot-monitor-sdk)

## 如何调试
### 本地测试
调试可以在本地进行调试,也可在借助dbp平台的在线调试工具进行调试。本地调试需要构造格式正确的的Request入参，可以参考samples里面的测试脚本的json数据格式，也可以通过dbp平台的
服务部署测试工具获取request的相应结构，参数构造好以后，可以把本地的Bot服务启动起来(node index.js),然后借助postman本地请求进行开发调试。 

### dbp平台工具测试
使用dbp平台的在线调试工具可以清晰的看到request和response，在服务部署配置完成后，就可以在页面上进行调试了，调试过程中可以修改部署代码然后restart更新。

599,599,Har-Kuun/DomainMegaBot,C,"# DomainMegaBot
A domain name bulk search bot with support of over 200 top-level domains.

Usage:
This script is written in C. It's been successfully compiled on several Linux distributions, but it's not meant to work in Windows environments.
Simply run:

~~~~
gcc -o DomainMegaBot DomainMegaBot.c
./DomainMegaBot
~~~~
Domain extentions database file TLD_DATA should be put in same directory with DomainMegaBot. The domain prefix dictionary should be a pure UNIX-based text file with one string each line. You can play with our demostration dictionaries to see how the program works.
When the program asks you to specify a domain extention, only type in the letters, for example, 'com'. Please do not type any sort of punctuations as that will end up an error.

Known issues: There are known issues that when bulk searching .cn and .vc domain names, the program will end up ""Segmentation Fault"" error after it finishes tens of searches. So if you insist using this program for .cn or .vc domains, you may wanna separate your dictionary file into parts.
